BREAKING: NUPRC revokes Oritsemeyin rig’s licence over safety lapses,"The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission has revoked the operating licence of Oritsemeyin Rig and directed it to cease all operations upon the completion of its current well operations.

The notice is contained in a letter dated September 11, 2025, addressed to the operator of the rig, Selective Marine Services Limited, and signed by the Commission Chief Executive, Engineer Gbenga Komolafe.

The commission made the announcement of the revocation in a statement on Friday by the Head, Media and Strategic Communications, Eniola Akinkuotu.

The statement read, “The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission has revoked the operating licence of Oritsemeyin Rig and directed it to cease all operations upon the completion of its current well operations.”

The media head, in the statement, noted that the decision followed a thorough review of the circumstances surrounding the drilling of UDIBE-2 wellbore during which a kick was recorded, resulting in several Non-Productive Time with consequential cost and a forced well sidetrack.

A kick on an oil rig is the unwanted flow of formation fluids (oil, gas, or water) into the wellbore due to a temporary pressure imbalance, where the pressure inside the wellbore becomes lower than the formation pressure.

This phenomenon, if left unmanaged, can lead to a potentially catastrophic uncontrolled release of fluids called a blowout.

Subsequently, the NUPRC, in accordance with Section 97 of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, issued a formal notice of culpability via a letter dated June 5, 2025, with a timeline of 21 days, followed by a reminder dated July 9, 2025, to ensure an amicable resolution, which was not achieved even beyond the stipulated time.

“Consequent upon the foregoing and pursuant to the relevant powers conferred on the commission under the extant Petroleum Industry Act 2021, the annual licence to operate granted to Selective Marine Services Limited for the Oritsemeyin Rig is hereby revoked,” the commission stated.

The upstream regulator also disqualified the Oritsemeyin Rig from all renewal protocols in strict compliance with the applicable provisions of the law forthwith.

The NUPRC noted that this action is in line with the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021, which empowers the commission to ensure compliance with good oilfield and international best industry practices, operational safety and optimisation, as well as promote technical excellence and preserve commercial and environmental sustainability.

The revocation of the Oritsemeyin Rig licence marks one of the most decisive enforcement actions by the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission since the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, which gave the agency sweeping powers to regulate technical, operational, and environmental standards in the upstream sector.

By invoking Section 97 of the PIA, the NUPRC is signalling that erring operators will no longer be indulged with extensions, serving as a warning to other drilling contractors and rig operators to strengthen their operational safety procedures, invest in proper training, and ensure adherence to international oilfield practices.",https://punchng.com/breaking-nuprc-revokes-oritsemeyin-rigs-licence-over-safety-lapses/,https://punchng.com
"Naira weakens again due to dollar shortage, market uncertainty","The naira on Friday depreciated to N1,538 per dollar in the parallel market, weaker than N1,535/$ recorded on Thursday.

Similarly, in the Nigerian Foreign Exchange Market, the naira slipped to N1,503.5 per dollar from N1,503/$ on Thursday, reflecting a 50 kobo depreciation.

Data published by the Central Bank of Nigeria on Friday confirmed the official exchange movement.

Consequently, the margin between the parallel market and NFEM rate stood at N32/$, unchanged from Thursday.

For the week, the naira appreciated by N9.5 against the dollar in the official market.

However, in the parallel market, the local currency lost N8, after opening the week at N1,530/$.

Nigeria’s economy, heavily reliant on crude oil exports for foreign exchange earnings, is susceptible to global oil price fluctuations.

A decline in oil prices or a drop in production can significantly reduce the country’s foreign currency inflows. Compounding this issue is a high demand for foreign currency, primarily driven by the need to import raw materials and finished goods, and for a range of services, including international school fees and medical tourism.

Over the years, the CBN has implemented various policies to manage these challenges. These have included a dual-exchange rate system, which the government has recently moved away from in an attempt to unify the official and parallel markets.

Despite these reforms, the parallel market continues to thrive due to a persistent shortage of dollars in the official market, leading individuals and businesses to seek alternative sources.

The current administration’s decision to float the naira has been a major factor in the recent volatility.

This policy, aimed at allowing market forces to determine the currency’s value, has led to a significant depreciation.",https://punchng.com/naira-weakens-again-due-to-dollar-shortage-market-uncertainty/,https://punchng.com
Lagos resident doctors comply with warning strike,"Resident doctors across several Federal Government hospitals in Lagos State have fully complied with the five-day warning strike declared by the National Association of Resident Doctors.

A visit by the News Agency of Nigeria on Friday to institutions including the Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital, Yaba; Lagos University Teaching Hospital; and the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, showed full compliance, as resident doctors were absent from work.

NAN reports that NARD declared the five-day warning strike after a 24-hour ultimatum to the Federal Government expired. This followed an earlier 10-day deadline that lapsed on September 10 without resolution of their demands.

The doctors’ demands include the release of the 2025 Medical Residency Training Fund, payment of five months’ arrears arising from the revised Consolidated Medical Salary Structure, as well as outstanding specialist and hazard allowances.

The strike coincides with ongoing industrial action by resident doctors in Abuja and Oyo State and comes after NARD issued a 10-day ultimatum to relevant government agencies over unmet demands.

The President of the Association of Resident Doctors, LUTH, Dr Benjamin Uyi, urged the Federal Government to address the demands before the five-day strike ends to enable doctors to return to work.

Uyi described the demands as long overdue and said they centred on the welfare of doctors, which he stressed was crucial for effective healthcare delivery.

“Any doctor whose welfare is not met is already a risk to patients. For a doctor to function optimally, his or her physical, mental, and psychosocial needs must be balanced.

“Doctors are already burnt out, faced with excessive workload and poor schedules, yet the government is still failing to prioritise their welfare,” he said.

Similarly, the President of the Association of Resident Doctors, NOHIL, Dr Babatunde Egberongbe, described the strike as “unfortunate,” questioning why the Federal Government always allows industrial action in the health sector.

Egberongbe said incessant strikes were a major factor driving the migration of Nigerian health workers abroad.

“The poor working conditions for doctors are the main reason many are leaving the country to practise elsewhere. Currently, there are limited numbers of doctors in hospitals across the country, yet the government has not deemed it necessary to prioritise their welfare and demands.

“As a matter of urgency, the government must address our demands, because we are not asking for anything extraordinary,” he said.

"Justify investment made in your training, COAS urges army officers","The Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Olufemi Oluyede has charged officers of the Nigerian Army to be adaptive, professional, and forward-looking in addressing the prevailing security challenges confronting the nation.

Oluyede gave the charge on Friday in Abuja at the graduation ceremony of participants of the Nigerian Army Resource Centre Leadership and Strategic Studies Course 3/2024.

He was represented by the Director-General of the Nigerian Army Heritage and Future Centre, Maj.-Gen. Gbemiga Adesina.

He stated that the dynamic nature of Nigeria’s security environment demanded officers who could think critically, strategise effectively, and lead with vision.

“The Nigerian Army expects you to apply the knowledge and skills gained here to enhance operational efficiency and contribute meaningfully to national security.

“I charge you, therefore, to be exemplary ambassadors of this Centre and to justify the investment made in your training,” he said.

Oluyede said the course was designed to bridge operational and strategic knowledge gaps among officers, thereby raising competencies to the highest professional standards.

According to him, the graduands, mainly direct regular commissioned officers, underwent 11 months of intensive training in political economy, defence economics, leadership, strategy, military history, policy analysis, and critical thinking.

He commended the Director-General of NARC, retired Maj.-Gen. James Myam and his team for their tireless efforts in running the programme.

He also hailed the immediate past D-G, retired Maj.-Gen. Garba Wahab, for conceiving and nurturing the initiative.

The COAS further appreciated the contributions of resource persons, facilitators, and academic partners who enriched the course, as well as the families of officers who supported them throughout the training period.

He reiterated the Nigerian Army’s commitment to continuous human capacity development as a cornerstone of operational effectiveness.

Earlier, Myam described the 11-month course as rigorous and holistic, aimed at sharpening officers’ skills for effective service delivery.

He urged the graduands to apply the lessons learned and demonstrate professionalism in their respective formations, stressing that their performance would be closely monitored.

“We expect your performance to reflect the quality of learning you have received here.

“You will be monitored not only by your actions but also by the quality of your thoughts and contributions.

“We charge you to be worthy ambassadors of the Nigerian Army Resource Centre,” Myam said.

He thanked the COAS for his unwavering support of the centre in terms of funding and institutional backing, which made the course possible.

He also paid tribute to his predecessor, retired Maj.-Gen. Garba Wahab, for initiating the programme and acknowledged the sacrifices of families and spouses who supported the officers throughout the demanding course.

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the LSSC was introduced to bridge training gaps between direct regular combatant officers and their regular combatant counterparts, with emphasis on leadership, strategy, and national security.

A total of 35 officers graduated from the course, including one Colonel and 34 Lieutenant Colonels drawn from various corps, units, and formations of the Nigerian Army.

"Mentor young women, Oluremi Tinubu urges female CEOs","Nigeria’s First Lady, Senator Oluremi Tinubu, has urged women in leadership roles to intensify their efforts in empowering and mentoring younger women to foster greater female representation.

Speaking at the State House during a visit by the Forum of Female Chief Executive Officers of Government Agencies and Organisations on Friday, she described the CEOs as trailblazers uniquely suited to their positions and emphasised their responsibility to nurture the next generation of women leaders.

Nigeria, like many countries, continues to grapple with issues of gender inequality, particularly in leadership and economic empowerment.

Despite constitutional provisions and international commitments to gender equity, women remain underrepresented in politics, government, and executive roles.

Tinubu encouraged the women leaders to leave a lasting legacy by mentoring others, drawing inspiration from iconic Nigerian matriarchs such as Funmilayo Ransome Kuti, Margaret Ekpo, Gambo Sawaba, and Abibat Mogaji.

“Invest in others by mentoring them and replicating your success in younger women to build a stronger collective,” she said, urging the CEOs to make impactful contributions beyond their official duties.

“We have to come together, better and stronger than them are. We have to ensure that we make life easier for women. Mentor young women, give scholarships, and take one person through life. Don’t look for the volume,” she stated.

On her decision to call for partnership in the completion of the National Library, the First Lady said the project would go a long way in helping indigent students in their educational pursuits.

In her remarks, the leader of the Forum, Director General of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, NIDCOM, Abike Dabiri Erewa, emphasised that they do not take the opportunity to serve the nation lightly and would continue to champion the course of good governance and service to the people.

“As a group, Your Excellency, we do not take our mandates lightly and are sincerely grateful to His Excellency President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for deeming us fit and proper to hold our respective offices, and that is why we are here to pledge our support to the Administration and to you as the First Lady of the Nation.

“We commend your Renewed Hope Initiatives. Your dedication to women’s empowerment is truly inspiring. Your efforts at women’s inclusion and ensuring women’s voices are heard are noteworthy. Your support for women’s rights and gender equity, and initiatives that uplift women. As a group and also as individuals, we affirm our commitment and unflinching support for your initiatives”.

“We pledge to work collaboratively with your office as you continue to foster unity amongst women from diverse backgrounds, drive progress, and implement initiatives that promote women’s empowerment and national development.

“We pledge our solidarity and support for the Renewed Hope agenda of Mr President, and we will assiduously work for his success in the 2027 election,” she said.

Burkina Faso scraps visa fees for Africans,"The government of Burkina Faso has announced the removal of visa fees for all African nationals, as a step to strengthen Pan-African solidarity and encourage the free movement of people and goods.

BBC reports that the Minister of Security, Mahamadou Sana, disclosed the policy shift on Thursday after a cabinet meeting presided over by the country’s military leader, Captain Ibrahim Traoré.

“From now on, any citizen from an African country wishing to go to Burkina Faso will not pay any amount to cover visa fees,” Sana said.

He, however, clarified that travellers would still be required to submit an online application for approval before entry.

Citizens of West African countries already travel to Burkina Faso without visas, but the move comes amid uncertainty over the country’s status in the Economic Community of West African States.

Along with Mali and Niger, Burkina Faso withdrew from the bloc earlier this year, raising concerns about future travel arrangements within the region.

The Sahelian nation now joins Ghana, Rwanda and Kenya in adopting policies that make travel easier for Africans, in line with the African Union’s push for greater integration across the continent.

According to the BBC, a statement from the junta’s information service said the new visa-free policy “for African nationals will also help promote tourism and Burkinabe culture, and improve Burkina Faso’s visibility abroad.”

Traoré, who seized power in a 2022 coup, has styled himself as a Pan-Africanist leader critical of colonial influence and Western dominance.

His popularity has been amplified across the continent, particularly on social media.

Burkina Faso, like its neighbours Mali and Niger, has been battling Islamist insurgents for over a decade, with nearly 40 per cent of its territory estimated to be outside state control.

Despite closer security ties with Russia and repeated promises by the junta to restore stability, attacks on civilians and the military remain frequent.",https://punchng.com/burkina-faso-scraps-visa-fees-for-africans/,https://punchng.com
NUPENG accuses Dangote of sponsoring division among tanker drivers,"The Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers has accused the Dangote Petroleum Refinery of sponsoring division within its Petroleum Tanker Drivers branch, resisting workers’ rights to unionisation, and deploying what it described as “falsehoods” to undermine the union.

NUPENG also accused the company of using a “Greek gift” of free nationwide petroleum delivery to undermine the union and stifle competition.

In a statement signed by its National Executive President, Williams Akporeha, and the General Secretary, Afolabi Olawale, on Friday, the union dismissed a press release by the Dangote Group on Thursday as “an epitome of unconscionable capitalist falsehood aimed at hoodwinking Nigerians and crushing NUPENG.”

On Thursday, the Dangote Petroleum Refinery dismissed recent allegations made by the NUPENG that it banned tanker drivers from joining the union, insisting that claims of anti-labour practices, monopolistic behaviour, and planned fuel price hikes are “entirely unfounded”.

NUPENG, on Monday, shut down depots, protesting that the Dangote refinery did not allow the newly recruited drivers for its 4,000 compressed natural gas-powered trucks to join the union.

The shutdown of depots lasted till Tuesday, when it was suspended following an agreement reached by both parties at a meeting organised by the Ministry of Labour and Employment.

However, on Thursday, NUPENG said Dangote was not ready to abide by the terms of the agreement.

But in a statement made available to our correspondent by the spokesman for the Dangote Group, Anthony Chiejina, the company stated that the allegations that it was undermining union activities and threatening workers’ welfare through its new deployment of CNG-powered trucks were not true.

The Dangote refinery reiterated its full support for constitutionally protected labour rights, stating that employees are free to affiliate with any recognised trade union.

Reacting on Friday, NUPENG alleged that despite signing a Memorandum of Understanding on September 9, which it said acknowledged the company’s initial resistance to unionisation, the Dangote refinery on September 11, 2025, instructed drivers to remove NUPENG stickers from their trucks and replace them with those of the newly formed Direct Trucking Company Drivers Association, allegedly created by the management.

“Our members have stoutly resisted this development,” the statement said, adding that the refinery has been attempting to sponsor parallel structures within the PTD branch since 2023 by recruiting members who had lost union elections into the DTCDA.

NUPENG also linked some of the individuals supporting the company in the media to ongoing criminal cases.

The union further warned Nigerians against what it described as the “Greek gift” of free nationwide petroleum delivery by the Dangote refinery, alleging that the move was designed to stifle competition and force drivers into the company-controlled association.

“It is on record that Dangote Group does not allow unionisation in its cement and sugar plants across Nigeria”, NUPENG claimed, stressing that the same anti-union stance is now being extended to refinery workers.

The union called on Nigerians and the international community to resist any attempt to deny refinery workers and drivers their right to freedom of association and unionisation, warning that its leaders must not be harmed in the course of the struggle.

“Our solidarity remains constant, for the union makes us strong”, the statement concluded.",https://punchng.com/nupeng-accuses-dangote-of-sponsoring-division-among-tanker-drivers/,https://punchng.com
VIDEO: Hilda Baci washes giant pot ahead of record-breaking jollof rice attempt,"Celebrity chef and Guinness World Record holder Hilda Baci has reassured fans and food enthusiasts of the hygiene of the giant pot she intends to use for her record-breaking jollof rice attempt at Eko Hotel and Suites in Lagos.

In an Instagram post shared on Friday, Baci said she personally washed the massive six-metre-wide pot using a branded detergent before the event kicked off.

“Yes, I can officially confirm this pot is squeaky clean! I personally rolled up my sleeves and washed it myself,” she wrote, tagging the detergent brand.

“In just a few hours, this same pot will be home to thousands of servings of Nigerian Jollof history in the making,” she added,

In an accompanying video, the chef was seen inside the custom-fabricated pot as she scrubbed its interior.

“I know you’re probably about to pop your eyeballs out. Why is she inside the pot?” she said jokingly.

“The reason I’m inside the pot at this moment is because I need to wash the pot.

“I can assure you that once I am done washing the interior of the pot and I’ve gotten rid of all the liquid, I’m going to rinse it again, and I have brand new mopsticks that I would be using to clean it once again before we use it to cook for you.”

Baci promised that the pot would be fully sanitised before the cooking began and pledged to serve “the most amazing, hygienic food you’ve ever eaten.”

PUNCH Online reports that the free event, organised in partnership with seasoning brand Gino, is expected to draw more than 20,000 people as Baci attempts to cook the world’s largest pot of Nigerian jollof rice.

Baci made headlines in May 2023 after completing a 100-hour cooking marathon in Lagos, a feat that earned her global recognition through the Guinness World Records.

"Air Peace faults NSIB drug, alcohol claims, insists on safety record","The management of Air Peace has reacted to media reports based on a purported preliminary report by the Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau, regarding an incident involving one of its aircraft at the Port Harcourt International Airport on July 13, 2025.

The airline’s reaction was contained in a statement signed by its management and shared on its official X account on Friday.

Air Peace, which operates domestic and regional routes, has in recent years positioned itself as Nigeria’s flagship private carrier, with a reputation for relatively strong operational standards in an industry often plagued by safety concerns.

The airline is also IOSA-certified, a global safety benchmark by the International Air Transport Association.

PUNCH Online reports that the NSIB on Friday indicted an Air Peace pilot and a Co-pilot for taking hard drugs and alcohol.

The accident investigators tested the crew positive for the substances after the aircraft they flew was involved in a runway excursion at the Port Harcourt International Airport on July 13, 2025.

This was contained in a preliminary report signed by the Director of Public Affairs and Family Assistance at Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau, Mrs Bimbo Olawumi Oladeji, made available to PUNCH Online on Friday.

However, reacting to the report, on Friday, the airline’s statement partly read: “Our attention has been drawn to media stories on a purported preliminary report by the Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau (NSIB) currently circulating online and in the media regarding the incident involving one of our aircraft at Port Harcourt on July 13, 2025.

“We are yet to receive any official communications from the NSIB on such findings over a month after the incident and after the testing of the crew for alcohol, which took place in less than an hour of the incident.”

The carrier emphasised that it places the highest priority on safety, transparency, and compliance, describing the report as misleading.

“As a responsible airline, we place utmost priority on safety, transparency, and compliance, and it is important to set the record straight,” the statement said.

The airline further explained its internal policies on crew discipline, stating, “Air Peace conducts frequent alcohol and drug tests on our crew. We have a very strict alcohol use policy that is stricter than the 8 hours before the flight as provided in the regulations. Drug use is a NO-NO!”

Providing details of actions taken after the Port Harcourt incident, Air Peace revealed that the captain of the affected flight was grounded.

“The captain of the affected flight was grounded and relieved from further flight duty till date for failure to adhere to Crew Resource Management (CRM) principles and for disregarding standard go-around procedures as advised by his co-pilot but not for testing positive to the breathalyser test, as the result was not communicated to us by NSIB to date”, the airline’s statement added.

However, the airline defended the co-pilot, saying he acted professionally during the incident. “Contrary to reports in the media, the First Officer (Co-pilot), who demonstrated professionalism in calling for a go-around to his captain, has been reinstated into active flying duties, with full approval from the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA).

“The NCAA cleared him. If he was involved in drug or alcohol use, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority would not have cleared him to resume flight duties”, it stated.

The airline added that if the relieved captain’s test result later proves positive, then it would “increase the frequency of our alcohol and drug tests on our crew.”

Air Peace also stressed the importance of retraining and stricter monitoring going forward.

“Again, the importance of Enhanced Crew Resource Management Training cannot be overemphasised. We will intensify strict Fitness-for-Duty checks and Stronger Internal Monitoring to prevent any breach of our zero-tolerance safety policy”, the statement continued.

Reassuring passengers and the Nigerian public, the airline added: “Air Peace has consistently maintained a strong safety record and strictly implements global best practices in all aspects of its operations, and we reassure our esteemed passengers and the Nigerian public that safety will never be compromised in Air Peace.”

The July 13, 2025, incident at Port Harcourt International Airport reportedly involved a go-around manoeuvre initiated by the co-pilot after the captain allegedly failed to adhere to standard landing procedures.

Umuada: How Igbo daughters of power leave behind shadows of fear,"In Igbo culture, South-Eastern Nigeria, the Umuada hold a place of great reverence. Seen as the “levelers” of the community, this association of women is regarded as a powerful court, standing as custodians of culture, order, and justice.

NAFDAC seizes ₦1.2bn fake malaria drugs in Lagos,"The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control has intercepted counterfeit malaria medicines valued at over ₦1.2bn in Lagos.

The agency disclosed in a statement on Friday via its official X handle that its operatives raided a warehouse in the Ilasa-Oshodi area, where 277 cartons of the fake Malamal Forte drugs were discovered.

“NAFDAC has intercepted 277 cartons of counterfeit and unregistered Malamal Forte malaria drugs, valued at over ₦1.2 billion, in a warehouse located in the Ilasa-Oshodi area of Lagos State,” NAFDAC said.

According to NAFDAC, the unregistered products were concealed in cartons labelled as Diclofenac Potassium 50mg and illegally imported from Shanxi Tianyuan Pharmaceuticals Group in China. The consignment was falsely declared as spare parts to evade detection.

NAFDAC’s Director-General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, described the interception as part of a broader crackdown.

“This seizure is part of NAFDAC’s sustained nationwide operation to protect public health and ensure only safe, quality medicines are available to Nigerians,” she said.

She explained that the agency had intensified monitoring at ports and warehouses across the country, working with other security agencies to stop smugglers from flooding the market with dangerous products.

Adeyeye stressed that government backing had strengthened the agency’s fight against counterfeiters.

“NAFDAC’s Director-General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, reaffirmed the Agency’s commitment, with the full support of the Presidency and Federal Ministry of Health, to eliminating counterfeit and substandard medicines from Nigeria,” the statement added.

The agency noted that the raid reinforced its warning to importers and distributors that it would not relent in its efforts to rid the market of harmful drugs capable of endangering lives.

Counterfeit and substandard medicines remain a major public health challenge in Nigeria, where malaria accounts for one of the highest disease burdens globally. The World Health Organisation estimates that Nigeria contributes about 27 per cent of global malaria cases and 31 per cent of malaria deaths.

Public health experts warn that the circulation of fake antimalarial drugs not only threatens lives but also worsens resistance to treatment, undermining years of progress in combating the disease.

NAFDAC has in recent years stepped up efforts against drug counterfeiting, with previous raids leading to seizures of fake antibiotics, pain relievers, and antimalarials worth billions of naira.

PUNCH Online reported in 2024 that in Ibadan, Oyo State, the agency destroyed smuggled, expired, and fake drugs estimated at about ₦11bn, further underscoring the persistence of the problem and the high stakes in the fight to safeguard Nigeria’s healthcare system.",https://punchng.com/nafdac-seizes-%e2%82%a61-2bn-fake-malaria-drugs-in-lagos/,https://punchng.com
Oyo Fire: Four Shops Razed in Ibadan Market,"At least four shops were razed on Friday morning at Saki Motor park, opposite Trans Amusement Park, Bodija area, in the Ibadan North Local Government Area of Oyo State.

Eyewitnesses told The PUNCH that the fire incident, which occurred around 2:00 am, was a result of embers unattended after the close of the shop in the night, ravaging four out of 11 shops before the arrival of firefighters.

Investigations further revealed that no casualty was recorded, property and goods worth millions of naira were torched by the inferno.

The state Chairman of Fire Service, Maroof Akinwande, who confirmed the incident in Ibadan, the state capital, on Friday, said the fire incident was reported at exactly 02:07 am.

He said, “The fire personnel led by ACFS Adedeji (Mrs) swiftly responded and deployed to the scene of the fire incident. Upon arrival, it was four out of 11 shops engulfed by fire, and our officers swung into action and curtailed and restricted the fire from spreading to other nearby shops and buildings. The fire was completely extinguished.

“No casualty was recorded, and the remote cause of the fire was traced to be lighted embers unattended after the close of the shop in the night, ignited by nearby combustibles, and set the place on fire. The four shops were affected by fire, and properties worth millions of naira were saved by the officers of the agency.”

Akinwande, who is also the Special Adviser to Governor Seyi Makinde on Fire Reform, therefore, advised the public to be conscious of fire and also emphasized the importance of having fire service emergency lines on their smartphones.

He further urged them to install fire extinguishers in their respective buildings to keep safe from an imminent fire incident.

“Report fire incident and give correct address, contact our emergency lines: 08067439223 and 08054353501 or 615,” the chairman added.",https://punchng.com/fire-razes-four-shops-in-oyo/,https://punchng.com
Four feared killed as gunmen attack burial ceremony in Anambra,"Gunmen suspected to be cultists on Thursday night attacked a burial ceremony in Ezi Village, Ogidi, Idemili North Local Government Area of Anambra State, killing four persons and injuring about 15 others.

Eyewitnesses said the assailants, believed to be from a rival cult group, stormed the venue on motorcycles while family members were performing the burial rites.

They opened fire on mourners, sending others scampering for safety before fleeing the scene.

“The assailants suddenly invaded the scene of the burial on Thursday and opened fire at the gathering, targeting some people who were present.

“The family members of the deceased and other mourners were performing the burial rites in the compound, when they arrived at the scene and shot at the mourners, while others scampered to safety.

“They came in some motorcycles and after carrying out their deadly mission, immediately left the scene,” an indigene who was near the scene, who did not want his name in print, told PUNCH Online.

Confirming the incident in a statement on Friday, the spokesman for the state police command, Tochukwu Ikenga, said operatives from Ogidi Division, led by the Divisional Police Officer, quickly responded, restored normalcy, and evacuated the victims to hospitals.

Ikenga said the Command has commenced a discreet investigation to identify, trace, and arrest the perpetrators, adding that preliminary findings suggested that the incident is connected to a clash between rival cult groups.

He said, “Following a distress call in the late hours of September 11, 2025, that armed men suspected to be cultists invaded a burial ceremony at Ezi Village, Ogidi, Idemili North LGA, and opened fire on the attendees, resulting in the death of four persons while 15 others sustained serious injuries.

“Police operatives from Ogidi Division, led by the Divisional Police Officer, swiftly mobilised to the scene, restored normalcy, and immediately evacuated the victims to hospitals for medical attention. In the course of the operation, 16 expended cartridges were recovered as exhibits.

“The Command has since launched a discreet investigation to identify, trace, and arrest the perpetrators, as preliminary findings suggest that the incident is connected to a clash between rival cult groups.”

According to him, the Commissioner of Police in the state, Ikioye Orutugu, has strongly condemned the incident and assured residents of the command’s resolve to rid the state of cult-related violence and other criminal activities.

“The Command urges members of the public to remain calm, security-conscious, and to continue to provide useful information by reporting suspicious movements or persons to the nearest Police formation.

“Further developments will be communicated in due course,” the statement added.

This latest incident comes months after PUNCH Online reported that seven people, including five police officers, were killed in January when gunmen invaded a compound in Ihiala LGA during preparations for another burial.

It was gathered that the family members in the compound were making preparations for a burial ceremony scheduled to be held on January 2, 2025, when suddenly, the hoodlums invaded the place and started shooting sporadically, leading to the death of the victims.

The assailants were said to have opened fire at the gathering, targeting security operatives stationed near the local government headquarters as they fled the scene.

The Anambra State governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, who visited the scene to condole with the families of the victims, announced a N10m bounty each for information leading to the capture of each of the gunmen responsible for the killing.",https://punchng.com/four-feared-killed-as-gunmen-attack-burial-ceremony-in-anambra/,https://punchng.com
Edo teenager rejects prostitution after Mali trafficking scam,"Eighteen-year-old Faith Joseph, on Thursday, narrated how she refused to engage in prostitution in Mali after traffickers tricked her into believing that she was going to work in a supermarket in Lagos.

Joseph said she was working as a maid in Afuze, Owan East Local Government Area of Edo State, when she was offered a salesgirl job in Lagos State.

However, her parents raised an alarm when they discovered that their daughter had been trafficked to Mali.

She was eventually rescued and returned to Nigeria with the support of the Edo State Migration Agency.

Speaking in Benin, Joseph said she rebuffed all attempts to lure her into the Illicit job when she arrived in Mali, telling her host in Mali that she had been told she was going to work in Lagos as a salesgirl.

She said, “I was told I would work in Lagos State as a salesgirl. When we arrived in Lagos at night, we slept in a hotel. The following day, we went to Cotonou in the Republic of Benin, where I complained that we had passed Lagos State. She (the trafficker) said we had not reached our destination.

“In Cotonou, she handed me over to a driver who took me to Mali the next day. In Mali, they took me to one lady, but I saw that it was not what I was told. What they are doing there is prostitution, and I told her I could not do it.

“I said I wanted to go back home. She said I could not go back until they brought another person to replace me. I was in Mali for three weeks before I ran to the police station.

“Life was not easy for me in Mali because I refused to do prostitution. Some people were giving me money to eat until I was rescued.”

The Director General of the agency, Lucky Agazumah, urged Edo residents to report cases of human trafficking.

Agazumah said Governor Monday Okpebholo was resolute to tackle human traffickers and ensure they were prosecuted.

PUNCH Metro recalls that after several years of illegal migration to Europe through Libya, the Edo State Government under Godwin Obaseki criminalised such trips as most of the girls taken outside the country found themself being forced into prostitution by their traffickers.

In 2018, the Oba of Benin, His Royal Majesty, Ewuare II, forced native doctors in the state to revoke curses placed on victims.

The oaths which are often administered by native doctors engaged by the agents were reversed with the Oba placing a curse against anyone who continued to engage in the practice.",https://punchng.com/edo-teenager-rejects-prostitution-after-mali-trafficking-scam/,https://punchng.com
Police: ‘Obi of Lagos’ admits installation was fraud scheme,"The Obi of Lagos hopeful and his accomplices. CREDIT: Leadership Newspaper

The Lagos State Police Command on Thursday said the arrested self-acclaimed “Obi of Lagos,” Chibuike Azubike, confessed that the planned installation was a scheme to defraud unsuspecting participants.

The command’s Deputy Public Relations Officer, Babaseyi Oluseyi, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday.

PUNCH Metro had earlier reported that 65-year-old Azubike was arrested while parading himself as the “Obi of Lagos.” He was apprehended on Wednesday with three alleged accomplices during preparations for an unlawful unveiling ceremony.

According to the police, the group had planned to launch a prototype of a purported N1.5bn “Palace of Obi of Lagos State” on Saturday, September 13, 2025, at Apple Hall, Amuwo Odofin.

Oluseyi said Azubike admitted during interrogation that the planned installation was designed to fleece unsuspecting guests. The suspect also reportedly confessed that, contrary to his earlier claims, he was not an engineer but merely a supplier of construction materials.

“Investigation revealed that the principal suspect, Chibuike Azubike, confessed he is not a qualified engineer but has been parading himself as one. Further findings showed that the planned unveiling of the ‘Obi of Lagos Palace’ was fraudulently designed as a ploy to swindle unsuspecting personalities and Nigerians of their hard-earned money,” Oluseyi said.

He added that Azubike acted alone without the backing or recognition of any legitimate chieftaincy authority. The suspect and his accomplices, he said, would be prosecuted once investigations are concluded.

Oluseyi urged Lagos residents to disregard misleading claims about the incident and remain vigilant. “The Commissioner of Police, CP Olohundare Jimoh, strongly advises Lagosians not to fall prey to fraudsters of the likes of Azubike and his gang,” he stated.

As of the time of filing this report, our correspondent could not obtain Azubike’s reaction as he remained in police custody.

The arrest has stirred ethnic debates on social media, with some questioning its legitimacy while others argue that assuming a traditional title without authorisation is illegal.

In a similar case, on April 1, 2023, the Eze Ndigbo of Ajao Estate, Frederick Nwajagu, was arrested for unlawfully parading himself as a titled chief in Lagos.",https://punchng.com/police-obi-of-lagos-admits-installation-was-fraud-scheme/,https://punchng.com
Amotekun foils 21-year-old man’s planned rape of Ekiti minor,"Operatives of Ekiti State Amotekun Corps have foiled the alleged plan of a 21-year-old man, Ahmed Abdulai, to rape a 13-year-old girl at Are Ekiti in the lrepodun/lfelodun Local Government Area pf the state.

However, the operatives said they nabbed the suspect, and subsequently handed him over to the Rapid Response Squad of the Nigeria Police, Ekiti State Command, for further investigation.

The Ekiti Amotekun Corps Officer in Charge of Communications, Adewale Adeleye, in a statement in Ado Ekiti on Thursday, stated that the incident happened at a bush in Are Ekiti on Tuesday.

Adeleye stated, “The suspect was apprehended by the Amotekun Operatives of lfedara LCDA outpost in lrepodun/lfelodun LGA during a patrol around 10:00 a.m.

“According to the arresting officers, the suspect allegedly lured a 13-year-old girl to the bush with the intent to have carnal knowledge of her, but could not succeed owing to the arrival of the officers who flashed torchlights on him, while attempting to rape her.

“He was also reported to have initially fled in the process.

“Upon interrogation, the victim narrated her ordeal, saying that the suspect had had sexual intercourse with her sometime ago.”

He noted that although the suspect, when arrested, denied the allegation, he said that he only had such copulation with a different person.

Adeleye stated that “the suspect has been handed over to the RRS of the Ekiti State Police Command for further investigation and necessary action.”",https://punchng.com/amotekun-foils-21-year-old-mans-planned-rape-of-ekiti-minor/,https://punchng.com
Police seek to reunite rescued Abia minor with family,"The Abia State Police Command has urged members of the public who may have a case of a missing child to come forward following the rescue by its operatives of a four-year-old girl in the Mbutu, Isiala-Ngwa Local Government Area of the state.

The command’s Public Relations Officer, Maureen Chinaka, in a statement on Thursday, disclosed that the girl was rescued after some suspected child traffickers abandoned her on the road upon sighting a police team.

This is coming on the heels of repeated campaigns by the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons about the prevalence of human traffickers and the dangers of their activities.

According to her, the girl was unstable and could not clearly identify herself or where she came from.

She urged members of the public who may have a case of a missing child to visit the command for identification.

She said, “A dark-complexioned girl, about four years old, suspected to have been stolen by unknown persons, was abandoned at Mbutu, Isiala-Ngwa, on sighting the police.

“The child is unable to state her name clearly or where she is from.

“Parents, guardians, or relations whose girl child of this description is missing are advised to visit the office of the Serious Crime Investigation Squad, Aba, or contact the Police Public Relations Officer for further enquiries.”

When contacted by our correspondent for a follow-up on whether the police had begun a manhunt for the suspected traffickers, Chinaka noted that an investigation was ongoing.

“An investigation is ongoing,” she said.

The issue of human trafficking, especially involving children, is becoming a trend that now puts families in distress.

In July, the Anambra State Police Command busted an interstate child stealing/abduction and trafficking syndicate operating in Uruagu, Nnewi North Local Government Area of the state.

During the operation, one suspect was arrested while 11 children, including five boys and six girls, were rescued.

In the same month, the Adamawa State Police Command rescued four kidnapped victims and 13 trafficked children in a series of coordinated security operations across the state.

While security and anti-trafficking agencies have continued to clamp down on this menace, experts believe that efforts should be intensified in nipping child and human trafficking in the bud.",https://punchng.com/police-seek-to-reunite-rescued-abia-minor-with-family/,https://punchng.com
Police arrest two suspected cultists in Lagos,"The Lagos State Police Command said its operatives arrested two suspected cultists with a gun in the Akoka area of the state in a crackdown operation targeting criminal elements.

This is just as it refuted claims that three people died as a result of a cult clash in the Lakowe area of Ibeju-Lekki.

The command’s Deputy Public Relations Officer, Babaseyi Oluseyi, disclosed this in an exclusive response to PUNCH Metro’s enquiry on cult activities in the state on Thursday.

The arrest is coming on the heels of the recent cult clashes in different parts of the state that have claimed no fewer than five lives.

Some sections of the media had reported that one person identified as Tope was shot dead in the Lakowe area of the state.

The report noted that the ensuing pandemonium that trailed the incident resulted in the death of two others who were knocked down by a moving vehicle while trying to escape.

Reacting to the incident, Oluseyi disclosed that the report was a false alarm and no such incident was recorded in the area.

He said, “The Lakowe report is a false alarm.”

He, however, stated that two suspected cultists were arrested by operatives in the Akoka area on Tuesday.

“On 09/09/2025 at about 2300hrs, following a distress call from Akoka, Lagos State, reporting the presence of suspected cultists, police operatives swiftly mobilised to the scene.

“On sighting the officers, the suspects attempted to flee but were given a hot chase, leading to the arrest of two suspects with a cut-to-size double-barrelled pistol, two cartridges, one UTC knife, and a long cutlass.

The suspects are currently in custody, the case has been transferred to the Anti-Cultism Unit, Area H, for further investigation, and subsequent developments will be communicated in due course,” Oluseyi said.

Within the last two weeks, no fewer than five persons have been killed in different cult clashes that occurred in the Ibeju-Lekki and Ajah areas of the state.

The clashes, which often stemmed from unresolved disputes and superiority claims, seem to be escalating beyond control.

Last week, three people were killed during a masquerader festival in the Ajah area, an incident which was attributed to a cult clash.

Similarly, on Tuesday, PUNCH Metro reported that two people were killed in the Ibeju-Lekki area of the state in a cult clash.",https://punchng.com/police-arrest-two-suspected-cultists-in-lagos-2/,https://punchng.com
Wanted Lagos suspected landgrabber surrenders to police,"The Chief Executive Officer of Prosperous Ariori Golden Venture Limited, Abiodun Ariori, who was declared wanted over the killing of some traders in the Owode Onirin area of the state, has surrendered to the police, PUNCH Metro has exclusively learnt.

The Deputy Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Babaseyi Oluseyi, confirmed the development following an inquiry by our correspondent on Thursday.

According to him, the suspect turned himself in at the command headquarters on Tuesday, accompanied by his lawyers.

Oluseyi added that he had been moved to the State Criminal Investigation Department in the Yaba area of the state.

He said, “The wanted suspect surrendered to the Lagos State Police Command on Tuesday with his lawyers. He was interviewed by the Commissioner of Police, CP Olohundare Jimoh, and has been handed over to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Homicide Section, for discreet investigation.”

Ariori had earlier been declared wanted by the police on August 27 after three people were confirmed dead the week before.

The former spokesperson for the command, Benjamin Hundeyin, had disclosed this in a statement, revealing that a police officer also sustained severe injuries in the clash.

“In the course of the preliminary investigation and prima facie evidence available, one Abiodun Ariori, CEO of Prosperous Ariori Golden Venture Limited, is connected to the deadly clash between the traders and the land grabbers. He is hereby declared wanted by the Lagos State Police Command, as all efforts to effect his arrest and bring him to justice have so far proved abortive.

It is very clear that he has gone into hiding,” he added.

Graphic footage from the clash, which went viral on social media, showed the victims with fatal injuries.

He added that, “During the clash between the traders and the land grabbers, three persons sustained fatal injuries, and a police inspector was seriously injured. The three fatally injured persons were confirmed dead when they were rushed to the hospital by the police, while the police inspector is in a critical and life-threatening condition at the hospital where he is receiving treatment.”

However, a source in the market told our correspondent on Thursday that executives of the market had a meeting with the CP earlier in the day.

“The market executives held a meeting with the Commissioner of Police today on the way forward in getting justice for the deceased victims. We were told Ariori surrendered himself earlier in the week and has been transferred to Panti. Also, we want them to know that the people killed were more than three,” the source disclosed.

The incident is one of the latest in a series of bloody clashes tied to the longstanding land-grabbing crisis in the state. Despite laws criminalising the activities of landgrabbers, reports of violent disputes over land ownership have persisted, resulting in casualties.

Members of the Olarinde Royal Family of New Oguntedo community, Satellite Town, Amuwo Odofin Local Government Area of Lagos State, on August 25, raised the alarm over the alleged forceful takeover of their ancestral land by suspected land grabbers.

The family also lamented an alleged intimidation by some officers of the Nigeria Police Force.

Speaking during a protest staged at The PUNCH Place, the family’s Public Relations Officer, Prince Yussuf Olarinde, accused certain police officers of colluding with the land grabbers to oppress and forcefully dispossess his family of their ancestral land.

He alleged that members of his family, including himself, had been subjected to various forms of harassment, intimidation, and unlawful detention orchestrated by hoodlums and security personnel acting on the orders of the land grabbers.",https://punchng.com/wanted-lagos-suspected-landgrabber-surrenders-to-police/,https://punchng.com

Anambra too sophisticated to be governed by semi-illiterates – APGA,"The Director-General of the All Progressives Grand Alliance campaign organisation, Prof. Solo Chukwulobelu, has said that the party and its candidates remained focused on the future of Anambra as the campaigns for the November 8, 2025, governorship election in the state gather momentum.

As the November 8, 2025, Anambra governorship election draws closer, political campaigns have intensified, with candidates and their supporters trading words over credibility and competence.

APGA, which currently holds power in the state, has the governor of the state, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, as the governorship candidate and his deputy, Dr. Onyekachukwu Ibezim, as his running mate.

In a statement issued on Friday, Chukwulobelu, who is also the Secretary to the Anambra State Government, said the issue of who has the basic qualifications to govern Anambra has remained a legitimate issue in the electioneering process, both now and in the future, adding that Anambra is far too sophisticated to be governed by semi-illiterates and/or people of easy virtues.

The statement read in part, “The 2025 Anambra governorship election is on November 8, and various political parties/candidates are exercising their constitutional rights to campaign for the office. Frustrated by the general opinion polls that the Soludo-Ibezim ticket is the consensus of Ndi Anambra for the election, some candidates are beginning to show desperation with the intent to distract or destroy.

“We are working hard to earn every vote based upon the value that we have created and will still create for the people. But the issue of who has the basic qualifications to govern Anambra will remain a legitimate issue in the campaign — both now and in the future! Anambra is far too sophisticated to be governed by semi-illiterates and/or people of easy virtues.

“The recent tantrums and despicable obscenities by the Deputy Governorship candidate of the APC, Senator Uche Ekwunife, are one example. Our response is that we will remain razor-focused on the issues about the future of Anambra, and no number of fabricated obscenities can distract us. We will not take the bait to get into the gutter with them. And we will not dignify them either!

“However, part of the fundamental issues for every election is the qualification of the candidates to hold such office. The Constitution of Nigeria prescribes a minimum academic qualification for the office of governor of a state. For Anambra, a state known for excellence (home to some of the most educated leaders Nigeria has ever had).”

He claimed that while the candidates of other political parties have lesser qualifications, some have presented fake and spurious credentials to the Independent National Electoral Commission.

“The past civilian governors of the state since 1999 include Dr. Chinwoke Mbadinuju, Dr. Chris Ngige, Peter Obi, and Willie Obiano.

“Our current governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo (B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. Economics, UNN), is a globally acclaimed professor of economics, consultant, and technocrat — with hundreds of international awards for excellent public service, including the Financial Times of London/Banker award as Best Governor of a Central Bank in the World; the New African Magazine’s (London) recognition as one of the 100 most influential Africans; and even celebrated by his alma mater, UNN, at its 44th Founders’ Day as the University’s Most Distinguished Alumnus.

“His deputy, Dr. Onyekachukwu Ibezim, is a medical doctor with accomplished public service. Together, both are leading a major social and economic transformation of Anambra State, and the evidence is clear. Our campaign is rooted in over 120 sterling achievements of the Soludo-Ibezim administration in barely three years without borrowing, and a robust plan for the next four years.

“With dozens of awards of excellence by newspapers, magazines, and institutions as well as endorsements by every stakeholder group in Anambra, Ndi Anambra are happy and clear about their choice. The last bye-election was a mock for the governorship, and APGA scored 75 per cent of the votes. November will be even more emphatic.”

According to him, part of the ethical and moral rebirth that the Soludo administration is executing is to rid Anambra of fake influences on its children and youths, such as influences that discourage hard work and enterprise and promote success by magical means.

“That is why we are pursuing fake native doctors (Okeite Dibia). Those who pay and obtain fake degrees and parade fake titles are also bad influences on our children and youth. It matters more for people seeking to lead the state. That is the issue, and it remains a legitimate issue for the election.

“From the forms filled by each candidate and submitted to INEC, we can confirm that the ticket of APC candidates has the worst qualification for the office of governor in the history of Anambra State.

“The APC deputy governorship candidate has, in an audio recording, admitted that she is already inside the mud and would fabricate and throw mud at our candidate and at everyone around him, including his family — for exposing some discrepancies in their qualifications.

“Very laughable is the ignoble attempt to smear the First Lady of Anambra State, a woman celebrated as virtuous and a model of womanhood and motherhood. As a campaign organisation, we are focused on the future of Anambra. We do not take the support of Ndi Anambra for granted,” the statement concluded.",https://punchng.com/anambra-too-sophisticated-to-be-governed-by-semi-illiterates-apga/,https://punchng.com
Kachikwu slams INEC over Mark’s ADC recognition,"The Presidential Candidate of the African Democratic Congress in the 2023 elections, Dumebi Kachikwu has stated that the Independent National Electoral Commission was “irresponsible” to recognise the leadership of former Senator David Mark as the party’s national Chairman.

He made the statement on Thursday while the Politics Today programme aired on Channels Television.

The PUNCH reports that INEC had on Wednesday officially recognised David Mark as the party’s National Chairman, with Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola as the National Secretary, and Dr. Ibrahim Mani as National Treasurer, among others.

Kachikwu, however, argued that the new leadership was on “borrowed time”, noting that the recognition given by the outgoing INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmoud Yakubu, was irresponsible.

“Nigerians as a whole know that the David Mark-led faction of the ADC is on borrowed time. What we saw from the INEC chairman yesterday was another irresponsible act from the outgoing chairman of INEC.

“It is a norm that when you have cases that are in court, you respect those cases that are in court, and you shouldn’t do anything that will affect the outcomes of those cases. The courts are sitting on our matter with David Mark and co next month, and Nigerians will see the rulings after the courts sit,” he stated.

The former presidential candidate also stated that he didn’t believe that the coalition had anything new to offer Nigerians, as all of the coalition members were former government officials who failed to provide good leadership during their time in office.

“If they (coalition) had leadership that we could look to and say these guys did well for Nigeria, Nigerians today would not be complaining.

“Nigerians today will not be saying that this country is a failed nation, but the reason why they are saying that Nigeria is a failed nation is because these guys all failed,” he said.

“So, what are they trying to do? Which nation are they trying to rebuild? Nation that they destroyed? Absolutely not! These guys are people who cannot stay outside of political office, who don’t have anything that they do for a living, and the only thing they need to do is to come back to political office so that they can start feathering their nest again and taking care of their friends and family,” he added.

Asked whether he would join forces with the ADC led by Mark to reform the party, and present a strong opposition at the 2027 polls, Kachikwu said, “Are you saying that my generation, your generation, the generation after us, don’t have anything worthwhile to offer in service to the fatherland? I believe we have Nigerians who have got what it takes to save this country.”",https://punchng.com/kachikwu-slams-inec-over-recognition-of-david-marks-adc/,https://punchng.com
Anambra election: APC postpones campaign council inauguration,"The All Progressives Congress has postponed the inauguration of its National Campaign Council for the forthcoming Anambra State governorship election.

The APC National Publicity Secretary, Felix Morka, made this known in a statement issued via the party’s official X handle on Thursday.

Morka said the event, which was scheduled to be held on Thursday, September 11, 2025, at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja, has been postponed.

He explained that a new date for the inauguration would be announced in due course, while assuring stakeholders of the party’s commitment to ensuring a strong showing in the November 8 governorship election.

“The party deeply regrets any inconvenience this change may cause and assures all stakeholders of its unwavering commitment to ensuring a successful outing in the November 8, 2025, Anambra State governorship election,” the statement added.

The postponement comes as political parties intensify preparations for the Anambra poll, which is expected to be one of the most competitive in recent years, with the APC, the ruling All Progressives Grand Alliance, the Peoples Democratic Party and the Labour Party all eyeing victory.

Anambra has been a difficult terrain for the APC in past elections. The state has been governed by APGA since 2006, with successive attempts by the APC and the PDP to wrest power proving unsuccessful.

In the 2021 governorship election, the APC candidate, Senator Andy Uba, finished a distant third behind the winner, Charles Soludo of APGA, and Valentine Ozigbo of the PDP.

The outcome underscored the challenge the ruling party at the federal level faces in penetrating the South-East, where it has historically struggled to gain widespread acceptance.

Despite these setbacks, the APC has continued to build its political structure in Anambra, leveraging federal presence and alliances with local politicians.

The forthcoming November poll is therefore seen as a crucial test of the party’s ability to expand its influence in the region.",https://punchng.com/anambra-election-apc-postpones-campaign-council-inauguration/,https://punchng.com
Don’t judge ADC on by-election losses — Spokesperson,"The coalition-backed African Democratic Congress has urged that it should not be judged by its failure to win any seat in last month’s by-elections.

Speaking on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Wednesday, ADC spokesman Bolaji Abdullahi, said the contests came too soon after the party’s leadership transition and should not be a yardstick for its potential.

The by-elections, held on August 16 to fill seats left vacant by deaths or resignations after the 2023 polls, produced no wins for the ADC.

The Independent National Electoral Commission declared the All Progressives Congress winner of 12 of the 16 seats, with the All Progressives Grand Alliance taking two seats in Anambra, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) one in Oyo, and the New Nigeria Peoples Party one in Kano.

Asked why ADC had a poor outing in the past election, Abdullahi argued the party was not electorally ready.

“We’ve explained it, we’ve issued a statement, we’ve talked about it several times. For us, the election happened less than a month after we came into the party. Most of the candidates, we didn’t even know them, and that’s why we said we cannot judge the ADC by that.

“You’re just talking about us transitioning into establishing our real leadership at this time. So, the by-election that you talked about happened too early in terms of transition for the party.

“So, we don’t want to be judged by the outcome of that election; other elections are coming, and we will be ready for those.

He said, following the official recognition of the David Mark-led leadership of ADC by INEC.

Alongside Mark, other principal officers now officially acknowledged by INEC include Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola as National Secretary, Dr. Ibrahim Mani as National Treasurer, Akibu Dalhatu as National Financial Secretary, and Professor Oserheimen Aigberaodion Osunbor as National Legal Adviser.

With this formal endorsement, the ADC leadership is expected to commence a nationwide reconciliation and mobilisation effort, as the party seeks to strengthen its presence across the country ahead of the 2027 general elections.

Setting out the party’s longer-term political aim, Abdullahi said the priority is building a mass party rather than chasing immediate victories.

“We want Nigerians to get to 2027 and ask themselves, has this ruling party improved our lives or made our lives worse?… So we want a situation where people want a change, they can look back and see our party as a viable alternative,” he said.

PUNCH Online reports ADC had initially attributed its poor performance in the by-election to widespread violence, vote buying, and irregularities allegedly perpetrated by the ruling party.

"I’ve kept campaign promises, delivered major projects – Oyebanji","Ekiti State Governor, Biodun Oyebanji, has declared that he has kept faith with the people by fulfilling his campaign promises, completing most inherited projects, and delivering on key development initiatives ahead of the 2026 governorship election.

Oyebanji stated this on Wednesday in Abuja, shortly after submitting his nomination and expression of interest forms at the All Progressives Congress National Secretariat, where he was received by a crowd of supporters.

The Independent National Electoral Commission has fixed the Ekiti governorship election for July 20, 2026, while the APC primary will hold on October 27, 2025.

The governor said his administration had achieved nearly 80 per cent completion of inherited projects, stressing that they belong to the people and were funded with public resources.

“When we campaigned three years ago, it was on the mantra of continuity for shared prosperity. In less than three years, we have achieved close to 80 per cent completion of inherited projects. We have also created conditions for productivity by investing in infrastructure, electricity, and healthcare. For example, over 60 communities that had been in darkness for nearly two decades are now connected to the grid.

“We believe productivity also requires a strong healthcare system. From primary to tertiary levels, facilities have been upgraded. We pay doctors and health workers parity with their federal counterparts while keeping up with gratuities and pensions. Beyond infrastructure and welfare, we are reforming the workforce to restore trust in government. Trust in leadership is critical, and I want to be remembered as a governor who kept his promises,” Oyebanji said.

On his priorities going forward, the governor pledged to deepen investment in education.

“One area I am determined to improve further is education. My desire is to see modern learning tools such as electronic boards in all schools in Ekiti. Education remains the pathway to productivity and prosperity, and we will focus more on innovation and technology to prepare our people for the 21st century,” he added.

Addressing speculation of division within the APC in Ekiti, Oyebanji dismissed the claims.

“The beauty of democracy is freedom of expression. People are entitled to their opinions, but the massive show of support here today does not reflect a divided party. Former governors, deputy governors, lawmakers, local government chairmen, and other stakeholders are united behind APC in Ekiti. As for my relationship with former Governor Fayemi, it remains cordial. Talk of division is mere propaganda,” he said.

He also urged party leaders to help the state break the jinx of one-term governorships.

“Since the creation of Ekiti, no governor has completed a second term in one stretch. We see it as a jinx that must be broken because it has retarded development. The people don’t want current gains reversed,” Oyebanji said, while affirming his willingness to subject himself to the primary process.

Senate Majority Leader, Opeyemi Bamidele, who accompanied the governor, said Oyebanji had delivered on infrastructure, human capital, and stability, stressing that for the first time, Ekiti stakeholders across divides were united behind one governor.

APC National Vice Chairman (South-West), Isaacs Kekemeke, assured the governor of a fair process.

“We have seen you and heard you. We have never witnessed a submission of forms like this before. Go back and do in Ekiti what you have done here today,” he said.

Dignitaries at the event included Ekiti’s first elected governor, Niyi Adebayo; former Senate Minority Leader, Biodun Olujimi; Senate Spokesperson, Yemi Adaramodu; and House of Representatives Spokesperson, Akin Rotimi, among others.",https://punchng.com/ive-kept-campaign-promises-delivered-major-projects-oyebanji/,https://punchng.com
"Otu, C’River ADC clash over PVC mop-up claim","Governor Bassey Otu and the Cross River State chapter of the African Democratic Congress have clashed over allegations that civil servants in the state are being compelled to surrender their Permanent Voter’s Cards to their superiors.

The ADC, in a statement by its state Publicity Secretary, James Otudor, on Wednesday alleged that the practice was ongoing across the 18 local government areas, describing it as “undemocratic, unconstitutional and a criminal offence under Nigerian law.”

“Reports have emerged that civil servants in various local governments are being directed to submit their PVCs. This act is not only undemocratic but also a criminal offence under Nigerian law,” Otudor stated.

He urged civil servants to resist the alleged directive, insisting that the voter card is the personal property of every Nigerian and its seizure amounts to intimidation and electoral malpractice.

But in a swift reaction, Governor Otu dismissed the allegation as baseless.

His Chief Press Secretary, Linus Obogo, described the ADC’s claim as “ludicrous, laughable and utterly outrageous.”

“The so-called alarm raised by the ADC lacks substance, coherence and even the most basic logic. No single name was mentioned in the report, nor did the reporter make the slightest effort to balance the story—an embarrassing display of journalistic laziness,” Obogo said.

He further questioned the credibility of the claim, asking: “Who exactly are these phantom ‘superiors’ allegedly demanding voter cards? Is every civil servant in Cross River suddenly a member of the APC? And to what conceivable use would such PVCs be put?”

While the ADC pledged to “stand guard over the democratic rights of the people,” the governor’s office insisted the allegation was nothing more than “empty noise” from a party seeking attention.",https://punchng.com/otu-criver-adc-clash-over-pvc-mop-up-claim/,https://punchng.com
"Natasha’s suspension over, any obstruction is abusive, ADC warns Akpabio, Senate","The African Democratic Congress has condemned the move to hinder the suspended Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan’s return to legislative duties, describing it as an abuse of power and a direct assault on Nigeria’s democratic principles.

In a statement issued on Wednesday by its National Publicity Secretary, Bolaji Abdullahi, the party accused the Senate leadership of disregarding both legal precedent and moral obligation by preventing the Kogi Central Senator from resuming her role after completing a six-month suspension.

Natasha was suspended on March 6, for alleged insubordination, losing salary, aides, and office privileges.

She insists the action was politically motivated after petitioning Senate President Akpabio over alleged sexual harassment, which the Senate dismissed.

Though a court ruled in her favour, Senate leadership maintained she must serve the full six-month suspension.

In July, security barred her from the chamber, sparking protests.

Her lawyer says she plans to resume on September 23, but a September 4 letter from the Acting Clerk reaffirmed the suspension pending an appeal.

In its reaction, the ADC cautioned that the continued obstruction mirrors the APC-led government’s growing intolerance for democracy, aimed at stifling opposition and suppressing dissenting voices.

Abdullahi stated, “The African Democratic Congress observes with deep concern the continued obstruction of Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan from resuming her seat in the Nigerian Senate after the completion of her six-month suspension. We consider this development not only malicious but also deeply injurious to the spirit of our constitutional democracy, especially the right to dissent.

“It is important to recall that the suspension of Senator Natasha was imposed by the Senate, not by a court of law. And whether one agrees with the basis for that decision or not, the tenure of that disciplinary action has lapsed. Any further attempt to prevent her from resuming is therefore both illegal and morally indefensible.

“This is not about partisan politics. It is about a dangerous precedent being set within our legislative institutions, one that reduces democratic representation to the whims of a few individuals rather than the will of the electorate. It is about a political culture that appears more invested in punishing dissent than in upholding justice.

“Let it be clearly stated, the people of her constituency elected Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan to speak on their behalf. Denying her access to the chamber is, by extension, denying her constituents the right to be heard.”

ADC expressed concern that throughout her suspension, Senator Natasha was stripped of her salary, aides, and office access, stressing that these are essential tools for public service, not mere privileges.

The statement read in part, “To strip an elected senator of these tools is not discipline, it is institutional mugging. Even more disturbing is the posture of the Senate leadership, which has continued to act as though legislative power can be exercised without accountability.

“We challenge the Senate President and his colleagues to explain why a suspension that has run its course should be made indefinite by stealth. Several respected Senior Advocates of Nigeria have rightly observed that Senator Natasha’s suspension, having fully lapsed, can no longer be used as a justification to deny her return.

“A pending legal appeal does not suspend constitutional rights, nor does it grant any official the power to override the mandate of the electorate. To continue barring her from office is, therefore, a violation of the constitution. The Senate, as the nation’s highest lawmaking body, must not be seen to violate the very laws it exists to uphold.

“We also note with concern the Clerk of the National Assembly’s refusal to process her resumption on the grounds that the matter is sub judice. While the Clerk may claim administrative caution, what is being projected is administrative complicity. His role is not to adjudicate but to facilitate. When the administrative machinery becomes hostage to political interests, the institution itself is diminished.”

The ADC highlighted that the Senate’s handling of one of its few female members carries wider consequences for women’s political participation.

It added, “Senator Natasha is one of only four women in a Senate of 109 members. Nigeria’s paltry female representation of 2.7 % is already among the worst records of women’s political participation, even in Africa. Any action that resembles gendered intimidation of the few women in the Senate would only discourage women’s participation and make Nigeria appear even worse in the eyes of the world.

“Nigeria cannot claim to be a democracy while marginalising half of its population from its most critical spaces of decision-making. The soul of democracy lies in its capacity to accommodate dissent, protect the minority voice, and uphold the rule of law, no matter how inconvenient. What is at stake here is not just one Senate seat, but the integrity of our democracy itself.

“The ADC, therefore, stands firmly in defence of democratic principles and women’s political participation. We therefore demand that Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan be allowed to resume her duties immediately.”",https://punchng.com/natashas-suspension-over-any-obstruction-is-abusive-adc-warns-akpabio-senate/,https://punchng.com
UPDATED: INEC recognises David Mark-led ADC leadership,"File photo: The Interim National Chairman of the African Democratic Congress and former Senate President, David Mark

The Independent National Electoral Commission on Wednesday officially recognised the David Mark-led leadership of the African Democratic Congress.

This development followed a period of internal restructuring within the party, which culminated in the emergence of new national officers aimed at repositioning the ADC ahead of future electoral contests.

Alongside Mark, other principal officers now officially acknowledged by INEC include Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola as National Secretary, Dr. Ibrahim Mani as National Treasurer, Akibu Dalhatu as National Financial Secretary, and Professor Oserheimen Aigberaodion Osunbor as National Legal Adviser.

With this formal endorsement, the ADC leadership is expected to commence a nationwide reconciliation and mobilisation effort, as the party seeks to strengthen its presence across the country ahead of the 2027 general elections.

The leadership transition began on July 2, when outgoing National Chairman Ralph Nwosu announced the appointment of David Mark as interim chairman and Aregbesola as interim secretary.

Nwosu said the previous leadership had voluntarily stepped down to allow for fresh direction and leadership.

However, the process was delayed due to improper documentation from the Excos. INEC had yet to update its records at the time, still listing Nwosu and Said Abdullahi as National Chairman and Secretary, respectively. Other listed officers included Kelvin Alagoa (Treasurer), Ifeyinwa Ntima (Financial Secretary), and Barr. Ujunwa Onwuasoeze (Legal Adviser).

As per INEC regulations, parties must submit formal documentation—including resolutions, verified signatures, and evidence of due process in order for leadership changes to be recognised.",https://punchng.com/breaking-inec-recognises-david-mark-led-adc-leadership/,https://punchng.com
APC expecting more governors’ defection – Yilwatda,"The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Prof. Nentawe Yilwatda, has said more governors will dump their parties and join the APC ahead of the 2027 general elections to support President Bola Tinubu’s re-election bid.

Yilwatda, represented by the Deputy National Chairman (South), Chief Emma Eneukwu, spoke on Tuesday at the 12th Expanded Stakeholders’ Meeting of the Bayelsa State chapter of the party in Yenagoa, where the APC formally endorsed Tinubu as its sole presidential candidate for 2027.

He said Tinubu’s governance style and performance had continued to attract defections from opposition figures, adding that more senators and House of Representatives members were also joining the ruling party.

It would be recalled that Delta State Governor Sheriff Oborevwori and Akwa Ibom State Governor Umo Eno recently defected from the Peoples Democratic Party to the APC to back the President’s re-election.

Yilwatda said:“Our doors are still open. More governors are moving into our party; more senators and House members are also joining because of the calibre, integrity, and output of the person we made president. Opponents may bark, but when a lion is at work, it doesn’t take notice of small animals.

That is what President Tinubu is doing—focused leadership that delivers results.”

He commended South-South governors for what he described as their “realism and political maturity” in aligning with the APC, saying their defection reflected confidence in Tinubu’s leadership.

“Because of what they saw in Mr President, they have abandoned their political parties to join our great party so that we can work together to move Nigeria forward. From the South-South to the South-East, leaders are making the same choice because they want a greater Nigeria. They are leaving their parties to support Mr President in 2027 and ensure an overwhelming victory,” Yilwatda added.

The APC chairman further hailed Tinubu’s courage in taking on reforms that others lacked the political will to implement.

“This president is not afraid. He takes the bull by the horns. What others could not do, he has done and is achieving results. President Tinubu is on the move to take Nigeria to greater heights,” he said.",https://punchng.com/apc-expecting-more-governors-defection-yilwatda/,https://punchng.com
Missing boots cause chaos for Man United women,"Manchester United Women were left scrambling just hours before their crucial UEFA Women’s Champions League qualifier in Norway on Thursday after discovering that several players’ boots had gone missing.

The team was forced to purchase emergency replacements from a local Bergen sports shop on matchday, having only realised the missing gear after arriving for their game against SK Brann.

United had trained at Carrington before departure, meaning the missing boots weren’t noticed until it was almost too late.

According to BBC Sports on Friday, the boots’ absence was not noticed until the day of the game, as United had trained at Carrington before departure.

Club officials arrived at the Torshov Sport shop less than three hours before kick-off at 16:30 local time and bought 15 pairs of boots and 20 sets of shin guards.

“We are a big store, but they were very lucky we had enough boots in stock that were the right size,” shop owner Andre Gullord told BBC Sport.

“They paid between £200 and £230 for each pair of boots and £30 for the shin guards.

“We have had the odd player come in because they have left their boots behind, but never the entire team.”

He added, “Maybe we should have told them we only had boots with no studs to help the local team!”

At Gullord’s estimate, the unscheduled shopping spree would have cost just under £4,000.

Marc Skinner’s side lost the first leg 1-0 to SK Brann as they look to secure a place in the main draw for the first time in their history.

United midfielder Lisa Naalsund, who is from Bergen, confirmed to TV2 after the match that she had asked her mother to bring some boots to the stadium.

“There were a few shoes that disappeared,” she said. “We haven’t quite figured out where they are yet. It was right before we went to the stadium, so there was a bit of chaos.”

United had taken a charter flight to Norway from Manchester for ease of travel, given they have a Women’s Super League trip to London City Lionesses on Sunday.

“A bag containing some of our players’ boots went missing during the journey to Bergen,” said a United spokesperson.

“We are investigating how this happened.

“In the meantime, we secured new boots of the right make and sizes for all the affected players.”",https://punchng.com/missing-boots-cause-chaos-for-man-united-women/,https://punchng.com
"Guardiola backs Haaland as world’s best, refutes Slot’s claim on Isak","Manchester City's Spanish head coach Pep Guardiola reacts during the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 Group G football match between England's Manchester City and Morocco's Wydad AC at the Lincoln Financial Field stadium in Philadelphia on June 18, 2025. Photo: AFP

Pep Guardiola said Erling Haaland is “a little bit above” Alexander Isak as the Manchester City boss responded to Arne Slot’s claim that Liverpool’s new signing was “maybe the best striker in the world”.

Isak could make his Liverpool debut at Burnley on Sunday after the Sweden star completed a British-record £125 million ($169 million) move from Newcastle on transfer deadline day.

Liverpool manager Slot hailed Isak’s quality after the 25-year-old trained with the Premier League champions for the first time this week.

But his suggestion that Isak could be the world’s best did not go down well with City boss Guardiola.

Haaland has scored 88 times in 100 Premier League games for City since signing from Borussia Dortmund in 2022, helping them win two Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FA Cup.

Isak moved to Newcastle from Real Sociedad in 2022 and scored 54 goals in 86 league appearances, helping the Magpies end their 56-year trophy drought by winning the League Cup last season.

Guardiola was quick to back Haaland as the cream of the crop on Friday.

“A little bit above,” he said of Haaland. “Isak is an exceptional player. You asked me about Erling and he is top.

“Isak must be a top player because of what they paid. Another one would say (Kylian) Mbappe, another (Lionel) Messi, Cristiano (Ronaldo).

“I wouldn’t change Erling for anyone. I know him. I like him.”

Guardiola will need Haaland at his predatory best as City seek to get back on track in Sunday’s Manchester derby after successive defeats against Tottenham and Brighton.

After a disappointing third-place finish last season, Guardiola hoped his revamped team would hit the ground running, but they have been beset by injuries and defensive problems.

– ‘Huge’ Donnarumma –

City have brought in Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris Saint-Germain to replace Ederson, who left for Fenerbahce after eight years in Manchester.

The Brazilian was a mainstay of City’s dynastic run in the Premier League, but his form dipped over the past two seasons.

Ederson’s ability to launch attacks with his superb range of passing contrasts with Donnarumma’s more rudimentary skills on the ball, but Guardiola has no concerns about the change.

“I always try to adapt to the quality of the players. I wouldn’t demand Gigi do something he is uncomfortable with,” said Guardiola, who refused to confirm whether Donnarumma or James Trafford would start in goal against United at the Etihad Stadium.

“We are talking about the best goalkeeper I have ever seen with distribution, short and long passes, in Ederson.

“We didn’t take Gigi to do what Ederson has done. Gigi has another quality. He is so tall. He is so huge.

“All the keepers save shots, bring personality to the team and be a big presence. He has done that in the biggest games.”

Guardiola is not worried despite City’s slow start to the season.

“When you change 10 players in four or five months, everything needs to be settled, fixed and consistent,” he said.

“We are still doing many good things, but we still need to be more consistent than we have been. Step by step we will do it.”

Liverpool’s Slot urges patience with ‘best striker’ Isak after record move,"Arne Slot on Friday described new signing Alexander Isak as “maybe the best striker in the world” but warned he would be eased into action gradually after a disrupted pre-season.

The Premier League champions signed the Sweden forward from Newcastle on transfer deadline day for a British-record fee of £125 million ($169 million), adding further firepower to their impressive squad.

Isak’s arrival after a protracted chase was part of an eye-catching splurge of more than £400 million in the summer transfer window, though a deadline-day move to sign Crystal Palace and England defender Marc Guehi collapsed.

“A lot of things happened on the last day (of the transfer window), which is not always the situation, because last season we hardly did anything during the whole window,” Slot said on Friday.

“But the thing that pleases me most, of course, is us getting the deal for Alex over the line.”

The Dutchman praised Sweden manager Jon Dahl Tomasson for the way he handled Isak’s workload during the international break.

The 25-year-old, who has not played any club football this season, was on the bench for Sweden’s 2-2 World Cup qualifying draw against Slovenia and was brought on as a late substitute in the 2-0 defeat against Kosovo.

“He gets one of the best, maybe the best striker in the world, and needs to play two very important games for his country, but understands that if he would play him twice for 90 minutes, then probably the player would have been injured,” Slot said.

“And that’s not always easy for a manager, that he takes care of the interest of a player, so he deserves a big compliment for that. And we will treat Alex the same as they did, so don’t expect him to be every single game 90 minutes on the pitch.

“That’s definitely not going to happen in the upcoming weeks. He missed a proper pre-season, I think he missed three or four months of team sessions, so now we have to build him up gradually, with us playing so many games, hardly any training time.”

– Isak criticism –

Slot, speaking ahead of Sunday’s match against Burnley, brushed off criticism that Isak received after he agitated to leave Newcastle, where he still had three more years to run on his contract.

“Sometimes people cheer for you, so I think after he won the League Cup (trophy last season), everyone was really happy with him,” he said.

“And in other moments you get criticised — this is part of his life, my life, our jobs. Now he’s a player for us and I’m really happy with that.”

Slot, whose team have won all three of their Premier League matches so far this season, admitted he had been keen to sign Guehi but would not be drawn about any future bid.

“I think it would be a bit ridiculous if I’m going to deny that we were close to signing him,” he said. “That’s so out in the open, that would be ridiculous.

“These things happen in football, it happened to our players maybe in the past as well, that they thought they were so close on signing somewhere else, and then in the last moment things changed.”

Slot, who is eyeing a record 21st English league title with Liverpool, said he had options in defence.

“It’s a pity, not only for us but also for the player, I think,” he said. “But he’s in a good place playing at Palace, where he won the Community Shield and the FA Cup, with a very good manager as well. So let’s see what the future brings for him and for us.”

"Strengthening Cholera Response and Preparedness in Lagos, Nigeria","In a critical effort to address the escalating cholera outbreak in Lagos State and bolster future public health resilience, the Government of Japan has committed $1 million to the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) for an emergency intervention. This strategic partnership aims to curb the spread of cholera, enhance preparedness, and save lives in affected communities.

Nigeria continues to confront recurring cholera outbreaks, with the past year alone witnessing over 77,000 suspected cases reported across 31 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). This resulted in a tragic 359 fatalities, indicating a 4.5% case fatality rate. Lagos State, a densely populated urban centre, accounted for over 20% of the nationwide caseload, underscoring its particular vulnerability to infectious disease transmission.

The persistence of cholera in Nigeria is largely attributable to systemic challenges, including inadequate sanitation, limited access to clean water, poor hygiene practices, and weak infrastructure. These vulnerabilities are frequently compounded by natural disasters and climate-related events, exacerbating conditions conducive to rapid disease spread.

“Lagos State is at the forefront of this public health battle. The Government of Japan supports Lagos State in responding to cholera outbreaks in the most affected communities by procuring essential medical supplies in partnership with UNOPS, because improving nutrition and sanitation is a priority of our Country Development Cooperation Policy for the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” stated SUZUKI Hideo, Ambassador of Japan to Nigeria. “We remain resolute in our commitment to enhancing sanitation, ensuring access to clean water, and ultimately safeguarding the lives of Nigerians, including those in Lagos.”

Recognising the urgent imperative for proactive measures, the Government of Japan has pledged its support through the initiative titled “Emergency Support for Cholera Response and Preparedness in Lagos, Nigeria.” Launched in March 2025, this 12-month project is designed to significantly strengthen local capacities, enhance community awareness, and improve early response mechanisms to prevent future outbreaks from escalating.

Under this vital initiative, UNOPS will collaborate closely with relevant national and local authorities to facilitate the procurement, delivery, and distribution of essential medical supplies, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) materials, personal protective equipment (PPE), and diagnostic tools critical for effective cholera outbreak management.

Hazel Natukunda – UNOPS Project Manager: “Our focus is on delivering tangible results on the ground – from providing essential medical supplies to strengthening local capacities. This project is a crucial step towards building resilient communities in Lagos, ensuring they are better equipped to withstand future health crises and safeguard the well-being of their citizens”.

The intervention will strategically target five Local Government Areas (LGAs) most severely affected by the outbreak: Lagos Island, Eti-Osa, Lagos Mainland, Alimosho, and Kosofe. An estimated two million people are projected to benefit from this comprehensive public health initiative directly.

This project aligns with the Government of Japan’s broader commitment to fostering strengthened, inclusive, and resilient health systems in Nigeria, as outlined in its Country Development Cooperation Policy. It signifies Japan’s unwavering support for Nigeria’s public health preparedness, particularly in times of crisis.

UNOPS anticipates that this crucial partnership will not only enhance immediate outbreak preparedness and response capabilities in Lagos but also contribute significantly to saving lives and building long-term resilience within the impacted communities.",https://punchng.com/strengthening-cholera-response-and-preparedness-in-lagos-nigeria/,https://punchng.com

"VIDEO: Influencers Enioluwa, Tomike cheer on Hilda Baci at world record jollof attempt","Social media influencers and content creators, Enioluwa Adeoluwa and Tomike Adeoye, arrived at the Eko Hotel and Suites on Friday to cheer on celebrity chef Hilda Baci as she attempts to cook the world’s largest pot of Nigerian jollof rice.

Baci, who broke the Guinness World Record for the longest cooking marathon in 2023, is hosting the “Gino Jollof Festival” in Lagos in partnership with the culinary brand.

"VIDEO: Nollywood veteran, Chiwetalu Agu, debunks death rumours","Veteran Nollywood actor, Chiwetalu Agu, has publicly debunked circulating rumours of his death.

In a video shared on Instagram on Friday, Agu urged fans and family to ignore the false reports.

His caption read, “Fans and family, please disregard any rumors about my death, and kindly report the page of the blogger who started spreading them. I am very much alive by God’s grace.”

In the accompanying video, the veteran added, “Chief Chiwetalu Agu, okenmiri n’ezoru Oha 1 of Etiti Amokwe, Enugu State is not going to die anytime soon.

No actress will say her G-Wagon was bought from acting – Yemi Solade,"Nollywood actor, Yemi Solade, has stated that no actress in the industry can afford a G-Wagon with the current pay from acting.

He stated this while speaking on the Honest Bunch podcast, cited by PUNCH Online on Friday.

Responding to a question about actresses who are yet to make a mark in the industry, driving luxurious cars, he said,

“People come to Nollywood for different reasons. I will continue to focus on the core professionals. Nollywood is not a house we have built for ourselves alone, so those you are referring to are tenants. Although we still have some ladies who are professionals in those same categories, but I won’t mention names, they live on what they earn from their producers.

“Nobody makes a lot of money that will give you all of those luxurious cars you have mentioned. I do not know how they make so much money to buy these cars. I know what I earn. In the industry, no actress will say that the G Wagon that she has was bought from the proceeds she got from acting.”

His recent comments about the financial limitations of Nollywood actors, particularly regarding luxury lifestyles, come amid growing public scrutiny of how some celebrities afford high-end vehicles, homes, and lavish vacations — especially when their professional earnings appear inconsistent with such spending.

Yemi Solade is a respected veteran in Nollywood, Nigeria’s multi-billion-dollar film industry.

With a career spanning over three decades, Solade has featured in numerous Yoruba and English-language films and is known for his outspoken nature and deep understanding of the entertainment sector.",https://punchng.com/no-actress-will-say-her-g-wagon-was-bought-from-acting-yemi-solade/,https://punchng.com

The event is expected to attract a crowd of food lovers and supporters eager to witness another record-breaking feat by the celebrity chef.

"Rooboy, Dede, Joanna return to BBNaija S10 after ‘fake’ eviction","Three Big Brother Naija Season 10 housemates, Rooboy, Dede and Joanna, who were earlier sent packing through the controversial red phone twist, have re-entered the house.

The trio returned on Wednesday night after spending two days in a secret room where their activities were televised to viewers, in line with Big Brother’s long-running twist format.

Their eviction on Monday had stunned housemates after show host, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, announced their exit, with Biggie sealing it through his usual countdown.

Rooboy had been ordered to leave immediately after answering the red phone, just as Dede and Joanna had earlier faced the same fate.

However, after the Travelbeta task on Wednesday, the housemates were shocked when Rooboy, Joanna and Dede walked back into the house one after the other.

Their return was met with excitement, easing the tension that had built since their supposed eviction.

Joanna declared she would not be leaving the house until the final day, while Rooboy made his presence felt with dramatic re-entries.

Housemate Sultana later disclosed she had suspected they would come back.

The red phone twist is one of Big Brother Naija’s surprise tactics where housemates who answer the call are given sudden instructions, often leading to evictions or punishments.

In Season 10, Dede was the first to pick the call on Monday and was instructed to name another housemate. She chose Joanna, and both were declared evicted by Ebuka Obi-Uchendu.

Shortly after, Rooboy also answered the phone and was similarly asked to leave the house immediately.

The triple exit left housemates in shock, sparking speculation among viewers about whether the eviction was genuine.

In past seasons, Big Brother has deployed similar ‘fake evictions’, sending housemates into secret rooms while allowing fans to watch their every move.

The tactic usually reintroduces drama and shifts dynamics when the housemates return.",https://punchng.com/rooboy-dede-joanna-return-to-bbnaija-s10-after-fake-eviction/,https://punchng.com
Tyler Perry hit with $260m lawsuit as actor alleges sexual assault,"Filmmaker Tyler Perry, best known for films like Acrimony and his popular Madea comedy series, is battling a $260 million sexual assault lawsuit after actor Derek Dixon, who starred as Dale on Perry’s BET drama The Oval, publicly detailed allegations of harassment and abuse.

In his first on-camera interview with ABC News on September 9, 2025, Dixon claimed Perry created a coercive dynamic that blurred professional boundaries and left him fearing for his career.

He alleged that Perry pulled down his underwear and grabbed his buttocks at the producer’s Atlanta home. “I was under constant stress, scared I’d lose my job or be killed off the show if I didn’t comply,” Dixon said.

Explaining the size of the damages, Dixon said the lawsuit represents both personal losses and a deterrent against abuse.

“Part of that number is my lost job, my lost income, the loss of a show. The other part of that is a deterrent for how do you stop a billionaire who won’t stop themselves from doing this,” he explained.

He also accused Perry of failing to deliver on a promise to produce a pilot he wrote, which he said Perry still controls.

Despite the risks of going public, Dixon said he spoke out “to protect future generations of actors and creatives,” adding: “Never exploit someone’s aspirations to coerce them into a relationship. That’s unprofessional.”

Responding to the claims, Perry’s attorney, Matthew Boyd, said: “This is an individual who got close to Tyler Perry for what now appears to be an elaborate scam. But Tyler will not be coerced, and we are confident that these unfounded harassment claims will not succeed.”

Dixon joined Perry’s productions in 2020 and filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in January 2024 before leaving The Oval later that year.

His June 2025 lawsuit has since intensified scrutiny of workplace harassment and power dynamics in Hollywood.

So far, Dixon remains the only publicly identified accuser. Perry has denied all allegations.",https://punchng.com/tyler-perry-hit-with-260m-lawsuit-as-actor-alleges-sexual-assault/,https://punchng.com

"Northern elders, northern Muslims, and double jeopardy","I am surprised members of the Northern Elders Forum, who are Muslims, have not backed some groups to campaign and have sanctions imposed on Nigeria over the killing of Muslims in the current state of insecurity. They would only be emulating what the ethnic groups of some of their members are doing. Or, isn’t what’s good for the goose not good for the gander? That Muslim members of NEF don’t do this for northern Muslims is an injustice. To add to this injustice done to northern Muslims, their southern brothers and sisters aren’t shouting “persecution of Muslims” as the other side does for their own. This is even though more northern Muslims have lost their lives in the North-East and in the North-West. To top it, northern Muslims are demonised for every act of insecurity in some parts of the North. This amounts to double jeopardy, and since one side is ever adamant to deploy religion to achieve other goals, Muslims, too, should feel entitled.

Recently, NEF said it wanted the FG to tackle “criminal violence and banditry” in the same North, where some tag every attack “religious persecution”. Those behind the latter are on platforms- online and offline- claiming only members of one religion are victims of criminal violence. They’re collecting signatures on X to pressure the US government to sanction Nigeria. NEF has members across the 19 states of the North. So, I ask all NEF members: Are people of one religion the only victims of violence and banditry? I ask because NEF as a body is silent regarding this claim. Its members, who are from areas where the claim is made, are silent too.

The claim of religious persecution has been taken to the US Congress, where lawmakers want the US government to impose sanctions on Nigeria. NEF is silent about this, too. Many other northerners who should speak up are silent, leaving only the President to defend the nation at that time. When sanctions are imposed on Nigeria for the wrong reasons, everyone will still call on the President to find solutions to the burdens sanctions bring on Nigerians. Yet, NEF watches as some misrepresent insecurity as religious persecution. It didn’t start today, and no one should think going around to misrepresent issues concerns only them and no other Nigerian. If anyone thinks they’re the only ones pained by the killings of any Nigerian, they need to be told that denigrating this nation and demonising any ethnic groups to outsiders pain other Nigerians too. Everyone has the right to campaign; deliberately misrepresenting Nigeria and its ethnic groups is a different matter.

How any group disparages this nation concerns every one of us. I keep asserting that if there are issues, let’s find solutions. Americans don’t come here looking for solutions to their internal problems. But some say they don’t trust the Nigerian government. It’s foreign governments they trust. Some of us would defend this nation to the best of our ability. And we would defend every ethnic group, too. No ethnic group has all demons, while other ethnic groups have all angels. If there are disagreements among people, and there must be, discussing and resolving them is the reasonable thing to do.

The group that goes about denigrating Nigeria and demonising one ethnic group for the actions of a few elements started under the past administration and it continues until now. This action has implications. I think the act of misrepresenting insecurity issues in northern Nigeria has been taken too lightly for too long, and narrow religious sentiments in the north and south of Nigeria fuel it. If it doesn’t stop, it might lead to where no one wants. It’s what I want to point out to members of NEF who have groups back home that misrepresent the challenges this nation has. For the insecurity situation, NEF, in a communiqué, demands that President Bola Tinubu impose “a state of emergency in northern Nigeria, acknowledging the extraordinary scale of the crisis”. NEF warned that a lack of action could endanger Nigeria’s stability and regional peace.

I think NEF misses what can endanger peace even more than insecurity. It’s hatred that some promote against their fellow northerners. Insecurity may end tomorrow. Solutions may be found, but hatred already spread won’t end. Violence that may break out from hatred from time to time won’t end. It may continue for generations – another double jeopardy at another level for all northerners. So, the worst of the dangers NEF fears will come from hatred being put in people. Regarding this, the President cannot help the North; it’s the North that can help itself and all NEF members of any religious persuasion have a role to play. Members shouldn’t gather to say one thing but return home to tell their people to hate one ethnic group or go about calling for sanctions against Nigeria. They shouldn’t be silent when this happens. Otherwise, keeping silent over misrepresentation only to assemble under NEF to issue communiqués has a name.

NEF should demand that all its members speak up against the spread of ethnic hate as well as every campaign to disparage Nigeria to other nations. NEF members can check every single religious online platform that carries news about attacks in the North. They’ll see how much space is devoted to demonising only one ethnic group for each attack. I once cited here how a website from the UK was lured into publishing materials which defined the entire Fulani people as “militias”, “terrorists”, and nothing more. Here I ask members of NEF who belong to ethnic groups where promoters of anti-Fulani materials come from: is this the truth about every Fulani person you have come across in your long careers? It amazes me how many Nigerians benefit from the kindness of people from tribes other than theirs, how the patronage of people from other ethnic groups helps them in life, yet when those ethic groups are demonised by their own people, they keep quiet.

Meanwhile, many Fulani people take action to address issues that have led to the wrong impressions created about them. For instance, the Sultan of Sokoto and head of Nigerian Muslims, His Eminence, Sa’ad Abubakar III, once said at an interfaith event that whoever committed an offence should be arrested and prosecuted, rather than criminalise every Fulani person. At another meeting with a Fulani group, the Sultan said every herder issue that led to the wrong impression about the Fulani needed to be addressed and stopped forthwith. Last weekend, one Fulani group met and said no Fulani herder should move around at night under the excuse of herding. Other groups have said they agreed that ranching should happen, but they needed some time for this adjustment.

To me, this means that well-meaning northern leaders of Fulani origin are making efforts to curb sources of tension between their people and fellow Nigerians. But it’s wrong to assume these leaders have absolute control over the many clans that make up the Fulani. Add the fact that some herders come in from outside Nigeria how disparate the situation becomes clearer. This indicates that time and more understanding are needed, and here, working with the identified leadership is key rather than going to other nations to tell them to resolve Nigeria’s problems. NEF should deploy its eminent members to build links of solutions and trust across the North, until peace is found regarding herder-farmer issues.

By the way, I’ve often wondered if NEF has concrete programmes it executes across the North, beyond the issuing of communiqués. I stated in the past that the calibre of personalities in many of the northern groupings, including NEF, could help undo some knotty socio-political and economic issues across the North. Most importantly, there’s a need to tread carefully around the hatred and insecurity that have been generated. Disparaging immediate neighbours won’t help anyone. For hate is a two-way traffic. Response will come even if it’s at the attitudinal level. Has anyone stepped into a setting and noticed there’s an air of tribal hostility against them? This has permeated the North for decades, and it could be made worse by the current demonisation campaign against one side. NEF as a body could have a mitigation programme regarding this if they had none yet.",https://punchng.com/northern-elders-northern-muslims-and-double-jeopardy/,https://punchng.com
Religion builds no nation; man’s wisdom does,"I grew up in a house of faith with a modest understanding of who the Creator of mankind is and how only He makes all things in heaven and on earth possible for those who call on His name. In the 1900s, my grandfather brought Christianity into my hometown of Imesi-Ile through the Methodist Church. His son, my late dad, was a lay preacher in the Methodist Church in Ibadan, the city of my birth, while my mum was a prayer warrior who breastfed her children with the fortifying milk of the efficacy of prayer of the righteous that always avails much. Although I am an ordained pastor in one of the fastest-growing Pentecostal folds in the world, I am also a journalist, a communication connoisseur of over 40 years, and a global public speaker on issues that affect government systems and societies at large. I also till the grounds in the field of behavioural science and clinical research. Hence, I am a conformist only with common sense and a maverick with a mind of my own.

Before I get lashed out at and called names by extreme faith-freaks, I humbly crave your indulgence as you read what I express in this week’s treatise that religion does not build a nation, wisdom of men does. As of this year, a comprehensive demographic study of more than 200 countries finds that there are 2.6 billion Christians of all ages around the world, representing nearly a third of the estimated 2024 global population of 8.142 billion. The number of Christians around the world has nearly quadrupled in the last 100 years. Christians make up about the same portion of the world’s population today (32 per cent) as they did a century ago (35 per cent). From the remotest and most obscure nook and cranny of Nigeria to the main street of every monumental mega-city, it is not a struggle to find galleria gatherings of people shouting, “Alleluia, Praise the Lord,” with enthusiasm and fervour.

In Nigeria today, there are not many streets spared of a church building. Some of these church structures are shacks and shanties, and lots of them look like royalty’s dwelling places. Even in the most treacherous parts of Nigeria, where Christianity is adamantly abhorred, church-planters audaciously take their faith messages to those cities, villages and towns. My hometown of Imesi-Ile in Osun State is a small and serene city of about 7,000 people. The last count of existing churches must be about 20. About five miles from my dwelling in Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos, are churches in different shapes and sizes littering the ever-busy landscape. Worship places are about five to 10 seconds apart as you drive.

Ten miles radius of my former residence in the South-Western city of Ibadan, there are at least 250 churches with imposing, mind-boggling, eye-popping edifices from where worshippers are not austere at all with speaking in tongues, singing, dancing, and shouting any hour of the day, and any minute of the night. Over the last three decades in our nation, the church has exponentially exploded in numerical strength. The question many people ask is whether building more churches and planting more faith palaces in Nigeria can help the economy create more for-profit businesses, generate employment, and contribute to human capital development through education and empowerment programs. Does religion build a nation? Must we put our faith and hopes for a robust economy and vivacious society in faith places, or in wisdom given to men by God?

The Danyang-Kunshan Grand Bridge in China is the biggest bridge in the world. It was built with cash money to the tune of $8.5bn. The wisdom of men, not religion, constructed the Chinese 102-mile human marvel bridge. The longest sea-crossing bridge, the Hong-Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, costs about $18.8bn and ingenuity of people in the government. Religion did not build it. Aliko Dangote built Nigeria’s rescuing and salvaging $ the 20bn Dangote refinery in Lagos. Determination and creative financial ideas of Dangote helped plummet the prices of fuel at the pump because of the refinery that took 11 years to build. It was not constructed by the sprinkling of the anointing oil.

Prayer is a great spiritual tool that revives the souls of men. If the recent road revolution across the Nigerian nation were left to prayer only, Nigeria would stay stagnant where it was two years ago, with decrepit road infrastructure. Humbly, I do submit that religion does not build a nation; great ideas emanating from the wisdom of positive-thinking men do. The accretion of numbers of churches has obviously trumped the growth of industries. Development of human potential in science and technology and possible growth of industries that’ll improve Nigeria’s GDP and economy is stalling in the Giant of Africa. In a dismal and economically challenged society ravaged by metastatic hunger, the attraction to get sucked into the church churning industry and pastoral work is at an all-time high.

Friends, religion does not make a nation rich; it only enriches a few religious honchos in society. Faith push does not rebuild an economy in ruins; it lifts only the captains of faith industries out of pauperism.

My recent visit to Nigeria spurred the following thoughts out of my spirit. If the deft diligence and calculated commitment to building more churches with helipads and gold toilet seats on vast acreages of land are channelled into revamping dead and dying industries, will Nigeria not be economically upbeat, financially propitious, and revolutionarily roseate a few years from now? Many of the problems our restless youth face today are more economic than attacks from an invisible devil. If raw material extraction industries, manufacturing and construction businesses, tertiary services companies, consumer goods, capital goods, and production goods industries receive half of the funds ploughed into constructing mega churches and massive mega crusades, will the unemployment rates of our youth not plummet precipitously?

Religion, we were told in Sunday School, prepares people for heaven we do not see. But great ideas prepare people for heaven on earth, where we all live today. Religion has not made nations affluent and self-sufficient. In many cases, it has buried their old men in hunger, enmeshed their young men and women in poverty, and made their children famished. Religion does not build a nation; great people with great ideas do. The Good Book says that heaven, even the heaven of heavens, belongs to God, and the earth He has given to the children of men. If the earth has been given to men, then we must be intentionally earth-relevant by operating in wisdom as we invest much more in industries that create jobs and spur prosperity across our land.

China’s journey to superpower: Lessons for Nigeria and the world,"As China commemorates the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic, it does so with a profound sense of historical reckoning. From a nation once mired in poverty, rural backwardness, and colonial legacy, China has emerged as a global economic and technological power. Central to this remarkable national journey is a dual story: the pursuit of modernisation and the eradication of absolute poverty at an unprecedented scale.

When the People’s Republic of China was established in 1949, the country was one of the poorest in the world. The aftermath of war and foreign occupation had left the economy devastated. Most of China’s population lived in rural areas under harsh subsistence conditions. Basic infrastructure was lacking, literacy rates were low, and disease was widespread. More than 80 per cent of Chinese citizens lived below the international poverty line, and economic life was primarily agrarian and informal.

Over the following decades, the Chinese state implemented successive development campaigns, often with mixed results. Early attempts at rapid industrialisation, such as the Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s, were met with minimal success. However, China’s modernisation took a decisive turn in 1978 under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, who introduced market-oriented reforms and opened the economy to foreign investment. These changes marked the beginning of what became known as the “Reform and Opening-Up” era—a transformation that would fundamentally reshape the country’s economic landscape.

Over the next four decades, China underwent one of the most rapid industrial and technological expansions in modern history. Annual GDP growth averaged nearly 10 per cent for much of this period. Factories sprang up in coastal cities. Rural labour migrated en masse to urban centres. Foreign capital flowed in. Entire towns transformed into manufacturing hubs. The rise of special economic zones like Shenzhen became symbolic of the broader modernisation effort. The state heavily invested in infrastructure, education, and industrial policy, ensuring that economic gains were widely distributed, even if uneven at times.

Yet, modernisation was not pursued for its own sake. It was explicitly tied to the ambition of improving human well-being and eradicating poverty. In fact, few countries in history have made poverty alleviation as central to their national strategy as China. The government, working through both centralised plans and decentralised implementation, systematically connected economic growth to poverty reduction policies. In many regions, infrastructure development was deliberately targeted at enabling poor villages to access markets. Agricultural reforms gave farmers greater control over production and allowed them to sell surplus produce, vastly increasing rural incomes.

Despite these efforts, by the early 2000s, poverty remained entrenched in some areas—particularly in China’s remote, mountainous, or ethnic minority regions. At the same time, the country’s rapid economic growth had produced stark inequalities, especially between urban and rural populations. Recognising this, China began a new phase in its poverty alleviation campaign. In 2013, President Xi Jinping declared the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2020, an ambitious target that would define social and economic policy for the remainder of the decade.

The strategy that followed became known as “targeted poverty alleviation”, a multi-faceted approach that focused on identifying and addressing the unique needs of poor households and villages. Government officials were assigned responsibility for specific families. Data collection efforts were intensified to identify who was poor and why. Support measures were tailored accordingly—ranging from agricultural subsidies and vocational training to relocation programs for people living in environmentally fragile or inaccessible areas. The emphasis was on precision and accountability, marking a departure from broad, one-size-fits-all programmes.

By the end of 2020, Chinese authorities declared a complete victory in the fight against extreme poverty, stating that all 98.99 million people who had been living below the national poverty line since 2012 had been lifted out of poverty. Furthermore, 832 counties and 128,000 villages previously classified as impoverished were officially removed from the national poverty registry. These results were verified through third-party evaluations and confirmed by institutions including the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank, which praised the scale and speed of China’s achievement.

This feat is even more striking when viewed in a global context. According to the World Bank, over 70 per cent of global poverty reduction since the 1980s has occurred in China. The country’s contribution to human development has reshaped the global poverty map.

In absolute terms, it has lifted more people out of poverty than any other nation in history.

But China’s modernisation has not stopped at economic development or poverty eradication. In recent years, Beijing has articulated a broader vision of what it calls “Chinese-style modernisation.” This concept, heavily emphasised in government white papers and speeches, refers not only to economic indicators but also to social equity, cultural confidence, environmental sustainability, and national cohesion. It is a model that diverges from the Western template of modernisation, rooted instead in China’s unique political system, long civilisational history, and centralised policy planning.

One of the central elements of this model is technological advancement. China now leads the world in several areas of innovation, including 5G deployment, artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, and high-speed rail. State-led investment in science and education has created an ecosystem in which technological modernisation supports not only economic growth but also public services, agriculture, and rural connectivity. This approach has allowed previously underserved regions to access digital platforms, mobile healthcare, and distance learning—further closing the development gap.

At the same time, the government has transitioned from a poverty alleviation agenda to what it calls “rural revitalisation”. This shift reflects recognition that lifting people out of poverty is only the beginning. Long-term development requires sustainable livelihoods, education, healthcare, infrastructure, and community institutions that enable prosperity to continue across generations. Rural revitalisation aims to ensure that the progress achieved is irreversible.

Nevertheless, a few challenges remain. Income inequality persists, particularly between urban and rural areas. An ageing population threatens to strain public services and pension systems. Youth unemployment is a growing concern.

China’s journey from one of the world’s poorest nations to a global superpower is not without complications. Still, it stands as one of the most important development stories of the modern age. The combination of economic modernisation and poverty reduction has transformed not only the structure of the Chinese economy but also the daily lives of its people.

It is a story of planning, innovation, mobilisation, and sheer scale—one that will continue to shape the 21st century.

For Nigeria, China’s transformation offers more than inspiration—it provides tangible lessons in how to structure national development around long-term planning, inclusive growth, and strategic investment.

One of the takeaways is the necessity of long-term national planning that transcends political cycles. While China maintained decades of continuity in its development agenda, Nigeria has often struggled with policy inconsistency and the politicisation of development programmes. A focused, multi-decade plan—especially in areas like infrastructure, industrial policy, and agricultural modernisation—would provide the stability needed for sustainable progress.

China’s poverty alleviation strategy also demonstrates the power of data-driven, targeted intervention. Nigeria’s current poverty rate remains high, particularly in rural and conflict-affected regions. Rather than relying on generalised anti-poverty programmes, Nigeria could emulate China’s approach by identifying the specific causes and demographics of poverty at a household level. This would allow for precise policy responses—whether in the form of agricultural support, skills training, healthcare, or relocation assistance.

Infrastructure investment, especially in underserved rural areas, was a cornerstone of China’s success. Nigeria’s persistent infrastructure deficit continues to impede growth. Learning from China, future investments should aim not just at urban megaprojects but also at connecting remote communities to economic opportunities through improved roads, electrification, and digital connectivity.

Agriculture reform is another key area. China’s decision to give farmers more autonomy and market access significantly increased rural incomes. Nigeria, with vast arable land and a large rural population, can replicate this by securing land tenure, supporting mechanisation, and investing in agricultural extension services and rural agribusiness.

Moreover, China’s use of Special Economic Zones to attract investment and build manufacturing capacity offers a template Nigeria can adapt. Nigeria’s own SEZs have been hampered by poor infrastructure and regulatory uncertainty. A renewed focus on making these zones viable—through governance reforms and better integration into national industrial policy—could catalyse job creation and export growth.

Another critical lesson lies in the prioritisation of education and technology. China’s rapid ascent in high-tech industries was no accident—it was the product of sustained investment in STEM education and innovation ecosystems. Nigeria must similarly prioritise education, research, and digital infrastructure to unlock the potential of its young, tech-savvy population.

Perhaps most crucially, China’s success hinged on coordinated governance—clear roles for central and local governments, and strict accountability. Nigeria’s federal structure presents both an opportunity and a challenge. Building more effective collaboration between federal, state, and local authorities will be essential to translating policy into tangible outcomes.

Finally, just as China transitioned from poverty eradication to rural revitalisation, Nigeria must also think beyond survival. It must build systems and institutions that foster sustainable prosperity, equitable growth, and social cohesion. Only then can it ensure that gains made today are not lost tomorrow.

In adapting these lessons, Nigeria does not need to replicate China’s model wholesale. Its political system, cultural diversity, and democratic framework are distinct. But the underlying principles—strategic vision, disciplined execution, targeted investment, and inclusive development—are universally applicable. If Nigeria can internalise and apply these, it will own its transformation story.

Re: JAMB and the obsession with ‘underage’ candidates,"The article by Ms Abimbola Adelakun ‘JAMB and the obsession with ‘underage’ candidates’ published in The PUNCH on Thursday, September 4, 2025, comes at an auspicious time and is welcomed because it affords one the opportunity to discuss an issue that is relevant to the calls that Nigeria’s education sector (with reference to tertiary education) needs urgent reforms. Reading Adelakun’s article gladdens the heart because she agrees with JAMB that underage candidates should not be admitted as students of Nigerian tertiary institutions. Indeed, she would like a system that caps the admission age at 18 years. Her words are fascinating in this regard, and I quote her here: “Let me state clearly that I do not believe that anyone younger than 18 should even be admitted into a tertiary institution. So, this is not a defence of the so-called underage candidate.”

As a lecturer, this admission by Adelakun saves one the time and effort of detailing the dangers associated with admitting into Nigerian tertiary institutions students below the policy-required age. Then, why this rejoinder? In her article, which necessitated this rejoinder, Adelakun divests JAMB of some responsibilities while equally ascribing to it duties outside its mandates; hence, she comes to the wrong conclusion that JAMB is digging itself “deeper into the mire of overregulation”. Therefore, it becomes necessary to dissect Adelakun’s article, strip it of misinformation and present another perspective to stakeholders.

The article uses the word ‘obsession’ to describe JAMB’s insistence on sanitising the admission process according to the regulation. The word ‘obsession’ implies that JAMB has an irrational preoccupation with this issue of candidates who are not of the right age as dictated by the National Policy on Education (2013). As a lecturer in a Nigerian university, I welcome JAMB’s intervention in reforming our tertiary education sector in this regard because of the wide-ranging consequences of admitting young adults who are not mature into our institutions. If, as Nelson Mandela said, education is the most powerful weapon which can be used to change the world, when is the right time to correct our mistakes?

The reformation of our tertiary education sector needs to be done, and urgently too. I would rather liken JAMB’s intervention to that of an emergency surgery, with timeliness, precision and strict adherence to regulation being important necessities for a successful outcome. What is worth doing is worth doing well, and on time. When there is fire on the mountain, no time is ever better than now. And now is 2025, not 2027 as suggested by Adelakun in her article. This discussion on the enforcement of the age limit in admission was concluded last year. JAMB’s performance of its duties of presenting qualified candidates every year in a fair and objective exercise should be commended, not castigated.

It must be stated that the decision to stick to the policy was made in 2024. At the 2024 Policy Meeting on Admissions to Tertiary Institutions, and after extensive deliberations by representatives of all tertiary institutions, regulatory bodies (NUC, NBTE and NCCE), and key stakeholders, all in a single room, it was agreed that the age limit for entry into tertiary institutions would be enforced. An appeal for a temporary relaxation to accommodate 16-year-old candidates who had already registered and participated in the 2024 UTME was acceded to, with the consensus that the age limit would be applied from 2025. Why wait an additional two years (making a total of three years) as suggested by Adelakun, when everyone has agreed that there is work to be done?

A child must be equipped not only with academic competence but also with the emotional and psychosocial skills needed to navigate the experiences of tertiary education. The age limit for tertiary institutions is not unique to Nigeria. Other countries, such as the UK and Australia, restrict admission into university for most, except for exceptional students. Similarly, school systems in countries like South Korea (which is like Nigeria’s 6-3-3-4 system), Norway and Germany ensure that the earliest age a child can get into university is 18. Age is not maturity, but based on research, a standard age has been set; tertiary education is for young adults. Nigeria must differentiate between schooling and learning; allowing all underage students in Nigerian institutions would mean most of our youth will end up schooling, without learning. A World Bank project tagged World Development Report 2018 states that worldwide, hundreds of millions of children reach young adulthood and leave school without acquiring basic skills such as the ability to calculate the correct change from a transaction, read a doctor’s prescription, or interpret a campaign promise. Some of the demographics of this report are Nigerians seeking admission into our tertiary institutions. A study by Wang and Chen (2024) showed that the factors responsible for student academic performance include the individual, family, school and social factors.

Section 7 of the National Policy on Education makes special provisions for children who are exceptionally gifted and talented. Adelakun admits that in Nigeria, most of the candidates described as “genius” are “just regular brilliant kids who need to be challenged in the standard learning system rather than rushed to the university”. Her solution is for each exceptional child to be evaluated by assessors such as school counsellors and teachers who have known them. However, this would produce a highly flawed, subjective and non-factual assessment as questions of bias, arbitrariness in the selection of counsellors and teachers and criteria, and thus, objectivity, would arise. Moreover, the statutory duty of presenting qualified candidates for Nigerian tertiary institutions for admission does not reside with candidates’ school counsellors and their teachers. JAMB, the regulatory body responsible for admission, will apply on these exceptional candidates, a unified exam via a scientific method guaranteed to produce an objective assessment and result. This is what JAMB has in place for the exceptional candidates to demonstrate their academic excellence and readiness to experience the challenges of tertiary education. Those who do not make the final cut in the process will be protected from engaging in the rigours of tertiary education, and they, their families and the nation would be the better for it in the long run. No sacrifice should be too much for the protection of our youth. Apart from academic performance, some other factors that could affect a student’s performance in tertiary institutions include the ability to live independently, study independently, withstand negative peer pressure and establish social networks. While it is expected that a young adult has developed these abilities, such cannot be expected of a child under 16 years of age.

The final authority to admit students rests with the institutions. JAMB’s role is limited to ranking candidates based on their UTME scores, with the final admission decision made by the institution. Already, several of these institutions have indicated their unwillingness to admit candidates less than 16 years old. A candidate must be 16 years old by October of the year of admission, which is also the year that the candidate sits for the JAMB examination.

JAMB is a credible organisation. After diligently carrying out research, it advises the government, which acts based on further research and advice. Therefore, it is preposterous to assume that the former Minister of Education took a rash and sudden decision on a matter that is of the utmost significance to the survival of the nation. JAMB statistics reveal a steady increase in the admission of underage (below 16) students into Nigerian tertiary institutions in recent years. In 2025, 41,027 candidates were underage. In 2023, 17,006 underage students were admitted, up from 15,915 in 2022, 11,933 in 2021, and 10,809 in 2020, a striking jump from just 824 recorded in 2019. Earlier years also showed notable figures: 8,548 in 2018, 8,775 in 2017, 7,472 in 2016, 6,442 in 2015, and 4,626 in 2014. The significant spike in 2020 raises important questions about the factors driving this surge. Are these students genuinely ‘gifted and talented’ as defined by Section 7 of the National Policy on Education, or is there another explanation behind these increasing numbers? Moreover, has anyone examined how these young students are faring in terms of academic performance and overall school life?

Studies have proved that age is a factor in the academic performance of students. Bigg (1987) and Richardson (1995) showed that older students have a more effective approach to learning. Oparinde, Ibrahim, Adeola, and Tayo (2025) recommended, among others, that Nigeria’s tertiary education regulatory bodies, namely JAMB and NUC, should impose penalties on defaulting institutions that compromise on the age-limit policy. Zeegers (2001) determined that age is one of the factors that dictate student performance. Voyles (2011) recommended increased mathematics support for younger learners. Admittedly, other studies show that age may not be a factor in student success, but these are few and far between. Wang and Chen (2024) showed the overwhelming influence that affective and psychomotor skills have on student academic performance.

As more concrete evidence, consider the stories of these two Nigerian underage candidates. David Orisheneye Okorogheye, who attained the top score of 332 in the 2018 UTME, was unable to gain admission to the University of Lagos for Medicine and Surgery due to being only 15 years old at the time. However, he was awarded a full scholarship valued at N9m by Bridge House College in Lagos to pursue a two-year Cambridge A-Level programme. After completing the course in June 2020, he went on to secure admission to Imperial College London, where he began studying Chemical Engineering in October 2021 at the age of 18. Similarly, Ezeunala Ekene Franklin, who achieved the highest score of 347 in the 2019 UTME, was unable to secure admission to the University of Lagos for Chemical Engineering because he did not meet the minimum age requirement of 16 years, being just 15 at the time. Later, upon gaining admission into Columbia University in the USA at the age of 17, Franklin reflected on his experience in an interview with engineersforum.com.ng, stating, “I am glad that I did not go to college once I graduated because the years I have spent in that interval have helped me mature. I can say I have discovered myself more.” This statement reinforces the idea that Franklin may not have been fully prepared for higher education when he first sat for the UTME. Moreover, their decision to switch to computer science and applied mathematics and chemical engineering, respectively, further highlights how the additional years of personal growth influenced their academic choices.

Yes, there are many other reasons that students of tertiary institutions flounder in their studies. JAMB addresses those concerns, such as age and academic competence, that fall within its mandate.

In her article, Adelakun calls for structural solutions that ensure that underage candidates do not present themselves for the JAMB examination. She, thus, invests in JAMB, responsibilities beyond its mandate. Going by the National Policy on Education’s 6-3-3-4 system, no child is expected to be less than 18 years of age by the time they apply to JAMB. In Nigeria, primary and secondary education are the responsibilities of the states and local governments. Only these levels of government can enforce age limits in our primary and secondary schools. The Federal Government, through JAMB, is doing its part; it is incumbent on the other levels of government to ensure that candidates who present themselves to JAMB for the UTME are not younger than the prescribed age of entrance into tertiary institutions.

Frustration in the flow: Nigeria’s PIA failure,"Four years after its passage, the Petroleum Industry Act has deepened mistrust and underdevelopment in Nigeria’s oil-producing communities, exposing the nation’s addiction to a flawed system.

Passed in 2021, the PIA was hailed as the long-awaited reform to fix Nigeria’s oil and gas sector. It promised transparency, stronger institutions, and lasting benefits for host communities after decades of inefficiency, conflict, and mismanaged revenues.

Four years on, that promise is fading. Instead of peace and prosperity, there is growing anger in oil-producing states, where the law’s design has deepened rather than resolved disputes.

Governor Douye Diri’s recent warning captures the mood. By stripping states and councils of any role in managing host community funds, and by slashing allocations from 10 to a mere three per cent, the PIA has alienated those closest to the people it was meant to serve. What once passed through state structures under derivation principles is now centralised in Abuja, fuelling protests and suspicion. Rather than uniting the sector, the PIA has become a source of division. It is failing both as an energy reform and as a social contract with the Niger Delta.

Nigeria has long depended on oil as its economic lifeline. In 2024, the country produced around 1.5 million barrels per day, hitting the OPEC quota for only the second time that year and reaffirming its position as Africa’s top oil producer. Reports showed that crude oil accounts for about 90 per cent of Nigeria’s foreign exchange earnings and nearly half of government revenue, yet the states hosting these vast resources remain underdeveloped and neglected.

For decades, Nigeria’s oil-producing communities have borne the cost of the nation’s wealth. Spills poisoned their rivers, their skies darkened by gas flares, and their farmlands ruined by exploration.

Roads, schools, and clean water were scarce luxuries, even as oil companies extracted billions from beneath their feet; development came only at the whim of corporate social responsibility projects, piecemeal gestures with no legal weight.

That CSR model defined host community development from the 1960s until 2021. Oil giants like Shell, Chevron, Agip, and Mobil decided what projects to fund, with no binding obligation to the people. Under successive military regimes in the 1960s to 1980s, token schools and boreholes appeared, but oil spills and flares went unchecked.

In the 1990s, the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa exposed the cosmetic nature of these efforts against a backdrop of ecological collapse. Civilian governments offered little succour. President Obasanjo introduced the 13 per cent derivation principle and set up the Niger Delta Development Commission in 2000, but corruption and mismanagement undermined both.

President Umaru Yar’Adua’s 2009 Amnesty Programme calmed militancy but did not resolve poverty or environmental damage. Under Presidents Goodluck Jonathan and Muhammadu Buhari, draft versions of a petroleum reform law circulated endlessly while oil theft and underdevelopment deepened.

For the host communities, CSR remained arbitrary, a matter of corporate goodwill rather than justice.

The Petroleum Industry Act of 2021 was sold as the cure. It promised to modernise the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation into NNPC Limited, a profit-driven company freed from political interference and subsidy burdens.

It created two new regulators, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission and the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, to clean up a sector long marred by opacity and inefficiency. The ambition was bold: attract investors, enforce transparency, and finally hold the oil industry to account.

At its heart was a pledge to host communities. The Act established the Host Communities Development Trust Fund, designed to replace inconsistent CSR with a binding framework for steady funding of social and infrastructural projects.

Yet the promise collapsed in the details. Communities had anticipated a 10 per cent allocation. The PIA delivered only three per cent of the oil companies’ operating expenditure. Abuja called it “fiscal prudence. Communities called it betrayal”.

The fund, managed by boards of trustees, was meant to guarantee sustainable development and repair a broken social contract, restoring trust, stabilising oil regions, and ensuring those who bear the cost of extraction share in its rewards. On paper, the PIA was nothing short of revolutionary. In practice, it has not lived up to its billing.

This shows that despite its promise, it is falling short of its objectives. It is fuelling frustration and unrest among oil-producing communities and stakeholders.

Even worse, state and local governments are excluded from administering the fund. This has heightened suspicion in the Niger Delta, where people argue that the closest political structures, which understand their needs, are being sidelined. The result is weak local development and rising tension.

Environmental neglect is another sore point. Oil spills, gas flaring, and pollution persist as widespread issues. The PIA’s provisions for remediation are poorly enforced. Cleanup obligations are weak, leaving communities to suffer degradation and health hazards with little accountability from operators.

Regulatory gaps further undermine the Act. It lags behind global trends such as digitalisation of operations, the transition to cleaner energy, and alignment with international climate goals.

The investment climate has also worsened. Poor enforcement of contracts, under-declaration of crude, and frequent disputes between communities, oil companies, and regulators discourage both foreign and local investors. Growth and modernisation targets are slipping away.

Finally, policy inconsistencies deepen the sector’s challenges. New fiscal measures, including tax reforms and refinery quotas, often clash with the framework of the PIA. These contradictions create inefficiencies and complicate dispute resolution.

The PIA was meant to transform the sector, but unless it is urgently reviewed, it risks becoming another missed opportunity.

A review of the PIA is not a rejection of its progress but a necessary step to strengthen weak areas and deliver real benefits to oil-producing communities.

The three per cent allocation to the Host Communities Development Trust Fund is widely seen as inadequate. Excluding states and local governments from administering the fund has deepened tensions. Bayelsa Governor Douye Diri described the Act as “a time bomb”, warning: “The states and councils are closer to the communities, and it was wrong to have them excluded from the administration.”

Industry voices share this concern. The CEO of Renaissance Africa Energy, Tony Attah, called the PIA “outdated on arrival”, urging reforms that embed digitalisation and artificial intelligence. “In today’s world, you can’t survive without AI. We need to revise the PIA to reflect current realities,” he said.

At the 2025 Nigerian Oil and Gas Opportunities Fair, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, representing Mr Diri, stressed, “The current PIA does not give any responsibility to the state government but rather a lot of liabilities.” He noted that host communities lacked structures to manage direct investments, fuelling hostilities.

Environmental safeguards also remain weak. Oil spills, gas flaring and pollution continue with little accountability. The Act lags behind global shifts such as renewables and digital transformation, leaving the sector exposed.

Finally, contradictions between the PIA and newer fiscal and executive policies, including tax reforms and refinery licensing, create confusion and deter investment. A comprehensive review is needed to align the Act with modern realities, strengthen host community benefits, and secure the sector’s future.

The PIA was a bold step, but it remains an incomplete endeavour. Without urgent review, mistrust, conflict, and investment losses will deepen. The federal government and the National Assembly must act now; Nigeria’s oil communities and economy cannot afford further delay.",https://punchng.com/frustration-in-the-flow-nigerias-pia-failure/,https://punchng.com
Hamzat Lawal: Inspiring Next-Gen Nigerian Youth Leadership,"Hamzat Lawal is widely recognised as an inspiring role model for Nigerian youths because of the way he blends activism, innovation and leadership to address social and environmental challenges. He uses data and digital tools to connect citizens with information about public funds and effectively demonstrates to young people how technology can be applied to solve systemic governance problems. Campaigning on issues like the Lake Chad crisis, artisanal mining, and allied challenges, he highlights the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities and shows young Nigerians that they do not need political office to influence governance.

However, last week, Hamzy, as he is popularly called, announced to the world that he was stepping down as the chief executive of CODE to pursue further education in the United Kingdom, as he has been selected as a Chevening Scholar to pursue a master’s degree in governance, development, and public policy at the University of Sussex. He announced Miss Hyeladzira Mshelia as the acting chief executive officer and head of office of the organisation, and Mukhtar Halilu as the secretary-general of Follow The Money International.

Knowing Lawal, I believe this auspicious opportunity is a milestone that not only presents a chance to deepen his knowledge and bring back fresh insights to strengthen the manifest sustainability mission of CODE, but shall indeed present an evolutionary window of progress for the entire nation.

Another way to look at it is that, in practical terms, it has drawn the curtain on the ‘youth phase’ of Lawal and opened the fresh scenery for the grand pupa to become a winged butterfly. In a widely circulated article he wrote after his 35th birthday in 2022, titled ‘Hamzat Lawal and the dilemma of building a new Nigeria’, he had announced his intention to transition from a youth leader to a citizen advocate, explaining that the country needed an enlightened young population that understood the power they wielded, and that he hoped to inspire them to make this happen.

“I was not up to 25 years old when I founded Connected Development, and its flagship social accountability initiative, Follow The Money. Through tenacity, focus and partnership with the right people, I was able to surmount all the challenges to serve my nation and humanity. I am grateful that this social accountability movement has carved a critical niche in the social space. Now that I am 35, I see countless opportunities ahead of me and recognise that I have also outgrown many opportunities as a result of my age.

“So, Hamzat Lawal of CODE and Follow The Money has metamorphosed to Hamzat Lawal of Nigeria. But with this development comes an enormous responsibility. I am somewhat afraid of what the future holds because, in spite of my experiences, I cannot boast of being certain of the next definite step to take. I am, however, driven by an unquenchable hunger to stand for what is right.”

I believe that interesting times are ahead for the country’s development sector. The former youth leader evolved from heady younger days as a cub scout to a boy scout, secondary school prefect, to a primary school teacher, to a cyber-café attendant, to an information technology specialist, to becoming a civil society activist, a climate change campaigner, an anti-corruption activist, a community organiser and mobiliser, a global citizen and political activist, and now, a scholar.

Nigeria is at a crossroads. Like he once wrote, one would think that the hard work and sacrifices of our past heroes, shadows of previous wars, gains and misdeeds would haunt those who have contributed slowly and imminently to damage our nation with no regard for consequences or the future. This is the time for the young generation to cut a new mould of patriotic zeal for the nation, especially starting from the sectors that matter – environment, climate change, food security, and digital governance.

My view is that now that Lawal is stepping aside, many more youths should step into his shoes, deliberately and systemically. He had always advocated for a seamless and innovative leadership recruitment system for the country. Perhaps the first is to learn from his own personal story. It all began 13 years ago, in a decrepit rustic suburb in Anka Local Government Area of Zamfara State, known as Bagega, where children were dying in their hundreds from lead poisoning because of artisanal gold mining. Lawal dreamed up the idea, which was couched in the hashtag #SaveBagega, a campaign that would draw the world’s attention to the lead poisoning crisis.

He and his friends mobilised global voices and compelled governments to act. That single campaign was proof that ordinary citizens, armed with truth and conviction, could move mountains. From that beginning, Connected Development was born, and over the 13 years, CODE has grown from a grassroots initiative into Africa’s leading citizen-led accountability organisation. Through its flagship initiative, Follow The Money, the organisation has empowered marginalised communities to demand answers, track government spending, and ensure that public resources reach the people they are meant for.

They have worked in over 3,000 communities across Nigeria and 12 African countries, giving citizens the tools to hold leaders accountable. They have tracked over N400bn in budgeted funds, ensuring they translate into schools, hospitals, water, and critical infrastructure. Certainly, Lawal’s activism earned him global acclaim. CODE’s work has been recognised with the ONE Africa Award (2017), the UN SDG Mobiliser Award (2019), and the Council of Europe Democracy Award. He has been listed among the 100 most influential Africans and ranked among the 100 most influential people in digital government worldwide.

Most importantly, the next Nigerian youth leaders must imbibe Hamzy’s spirit of mentorship and humility. To shape the future, you must cast your mould in the rules of thumb emblazoned in unfamiliar paths of weather-tested veterans who have succeeded in the different sectors. This is the only way to build the next generation of leaders who will change the developmental narrative and trajectory of the nation without repeating the mistakes of the past.

Lawal tapped from the ecological flowing streams of the green icon Ewah Eleri of the International Centre for Energy, Environment and Development; the transparency fountains of Nuhu Ribadu, the pioneer anti-corruption czar at the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission; and the managerial genius of Atedo Peterside, the financial guru who founded the Stanbic IBTC Bank at age 33. All these citizens supplied the ingredients that galvanised the Lawal gusto.

To be sure, over 60 per cent of Nigeria’s population is under 30. With such a youthful population, it is only natural that young people should play an active role in shaping Nigeria’s future. Youth leaders bring creativity, technological know-how and new approaches to solving problems in governance, business and social development. Active youth leaders can connect the concerns of younger Nigerians with decision-makers, ensuring policies address the needs of education, jobs, climate change and digital inclusion. When young people see their peers in leadership, they are more likely to be inspired positively, reducing tendencies toward crime, extremism and apathy. Also, curbing unemployment and ensuring there is a pool of fresh brains to replace the old order, because nobody can remain in a leadership position forever.

Perhaps that was what drove Lawal when he co-led the Not Too Young To Run campaign that saw the reduction of age limits for elective offices in Nigeria. Therefore, as he prepares for his studies, I wish him the very best the Almighty can give in wisdom, sound health and mind, and favours with his academic peers and mentors. May the flame he ignited in Nigeria find its way into capable hands to continue to build a more accountable, transparent, and equitable Africa.",https://punchng.com/waiting-for-the-next-youth-leader/,https://punchng.com
FirstBank floors Nduka Obiagbena’s GHL at the Court of Appeal,"First Bank of Nigeria Limited (FirstBank) has secured a significant victory at the Court of Appeal , its case against General Hydrocarbons Limited (GHL) filed by their lawyers Babajide Koku SAN and Victor Ogude SAN

In its judgment , the Court of Appeal at the instance of GHL to hear FBN’s appeal on an urgent basis during the Court’s vacation after hearing the appeal , on Thursday the 11 September 2025 set aside the earlier decision of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt , Obile J which had earlier dismissed FirstBank’s claims regarding the fraudulent diversion of proceeds from the sale of crude oil cargo pledged as collateral for loan facilities.

The dispute arose from crude oil aboard the FPSO Tamara Tokoni, which GHL had pledged to FirstBank as security for substantial loan facilities. Contrary to the terms of the pledge, GHL diverted the proceeds from the sale of the cargo, prompting the Bank to seek legal redress.

FirstBank filed an appeal challenging the trial court’s decision that had treated the matter as a simple debt recovery. The Court of Appeal, in its ruling, affirmed the maritime nature of the claim and emphasised the importance of preserving the Res, the crude oil cargo, as the central issue in dispute.

The Court set aside the earlier order of the trial court vacating the order of arrest of 2nd respondent.

The appellate court allowed FirstBank’s appeal and set aside the Federal High Court’s ruling. It authorised the sale of the crude oil cargo aboard FPSO Tamara Tokoni, with the proceeds to be deposited into an interest-yielding escrow account under the custody of the Chief Registrar of the Court of Appeal, pending the hearing and determination of the case at the trial court and the court of arbitration. The Chief Registrar was also appointed to take possession of the cargo and ensure its protection against dissipation or unauthorised disposition by any party.

This ruling marks a significant milestone for FirstBank and reinforces the Bank’s commitment to upholding the integrity of financial transactions and protecting the interests of its stakeholders.

FirstBank remains steadfast in its dedication to sound corporate governance, legal compliance, and the protection of its assets. The judgement of the Court of Appeal sets a strong precedent for the enforcement of collateral agreements and accountability in high-value commercial transactions.",https://punchng.com/firstbank-floors-nduka-obiagbenas-ghl-at-the-court-of-appeal-2/,https://punchng.com
China’s journey to superpower: Lessons for Nigeria and the world,"Chinese President Xi Jinping (L) speaks with Vietnam's President Luong Cuong (R) as he arrives for a two-day state visit at Hanoi's Noi Bai International Airport on April 14, 2025.

As China commemorates the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic, it does so with a profound sense of historical reckoning. From a nation once mired in poverty, rural backwardness, and colonial legacy, China has emerged as a global economic and technological power. Central to this remarkable national journey is a dual story: the pursuit of modernisation and the eradication of absolute poverty at an unprecedented scale.

When the People’s Republic of China was established in 1949, the country was one of the poorest in the world. The aftermath of war and foreign occupation had left the economy devastated. Most of China’s population lived in rural areas under harsh subsistence conditions. Basic infrastructure was lacking, literacy rates were low, and disease was widespread. More than 80 per cent of Chinese citizens lived below the international poverty line, and economic life was primarily agrarian and informal.

Over the following decades, the Chinese state implemented successive development campaigns, often with mixed results. Early attempts at rapid industrialisation, such as the Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s, were met with minimal success. However, China’s modernisation took a decisive turn in 1978 under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, who introduced market-oriented reforms and opened the economy to foreign investment. These changes marked the beginning of what became known as the “Reform and Opening-Up” era—a transformation that would fundamentally reshape the country’s economic landscape.

Over the next four decades, China underwent one of the most rapid industrial and technological expansions in modern history. Annual GDP growth averaged nearly 10 per cent for much of this period. Factories sprang up in coastal cities. Rural labour migrated en masse to urban centres. Foreign capital flowed in. Entire towns transformed into manufacturing hubs. The rise of special economic zones like Shenzhen became symbolic of the broader modernisation effort. The state heavily invested in infrastructure, education, and industrial policy, ensuring that economic gains were widely distributed, even if uneven at times.

Yet, modernisation was not pursued for its own sake. It was explicitly tied to the ambition of improving human well-being and eradicating poverty. In fact, few countries in history have made poverty alleviation as central to their national strategy as China. The government, working through both centralised plans and decentralised implementation, systematically connected economic growth to poverty reduction policies. In many regions, infrastructure development was deliberately targeted at enabling poor villages to access markets. Agricultural reforms gave farmers greater control over production and allowed them to sell surplus produce, vastly increasing rural incomes.

Despite these efforts, by the early 2000s, poverty remained entrenched in some areas—particularly in China’s remote, mountainous, or ethnic minority regions. At the same time, the country’s rapid economic growth had produced stark inequalities, especially between urban and rural populations. Recognising this, China began a new phase in its poverty alleviation campaign. In 2013, President Xi Jinping declared the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2020, an ambitious target that would define social and economic policy for the remainder of the decade.

The strategy that followed became known as “targeted poverty alleviation”, a multi-faceted approach that focused on identifying and addressing the unique needs of poor households and villages. Government officials were assigned responsibility for specific families. Data collection efforts were intensified to identify who was poor and why. Support measures were tailored accordingly—ranging from agricultural subsidies and vocational training to relocation programs for people living in environmentally fragile or inaccessible areas. The emphasis was on precision and accountability, marking a departure from broad, one-size-fits-all programmes.

By the end of 2020, Chinese authorities declared a complete victory in the fight against extreme poverty, stating that all 98.99 million people who had been living below the national poverty line since 2012 had been lifted out of poverty. Furthermore, 832 counties and 128,000 villages previously classified as impoverished were officially removed from the national poverty registry. These results were verified through third-party evaluations and confirmed by institutions including the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank, which praised the scale and speed of China’s achievement.

This feat is even more striking when viewed in a global context. According to the World Bank, over 70 per cent of global poverty reduction since the 1980s has occurred in China. The country’s contribution to human development has reshaped the global poverty map.

In absolute terms, it has lifted more people out of poverty than any other nation in history.

But China’s modernisation has not stopped at economic development or poverty eradication. In recent years, Beijing has articulated a broader vision of what it calls “Chinese-style modernisation.” This concept, heavily emphasised in government white papers and speeches, refers not only to economic indicators but also to social equity, cultural confidence, environmental sustainability, and national cohesion. It is a model that diverges from the Western template of modernisation, rooted instead in China’s unique political system, long civilisational history, and centralised policy planning.

One of the central elements of this model is technological advancement. China now leads the world in several areas of innovation, including 5G deployment, artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, and high-speed rail. State-led investment in science and education has created an ecosystem in which technological modernisation supports not only economic growth but also public services, agriculture, and rural connectivity. This approach has allowed previously underserved regions to access digital platforms, mobile healthcare, and distance learning—further closing the development gap.

At the same time, the government has transitioned from a poverty alleviation agenda to what it calls “rural revitalisation”. This shift reflects recognition that lifting people out of poverty is only the beginning. Long-term development requires sustainable livelihoods, education, healthcare, infrastructure, and community institutions that enable prosperity to continue across generations. Rural revitalisation aims to ensure that the progress achieved is irreversible.

Nevertheless, a few challenges remain. Income inequality persists, particularly between urban and rural areas. An ageing population threatens to strain public services and pension systems. Youth unemployment is a growing concern.

China’s journey from one of the world’s poorest nations to a global superpower is not without complications. Still, it stands as one of the most important development stories of the modern age. The combination of economic modernisation and poverty reduction has transformed not only the structure of the Chinese economy but also the daily lives of its people.

It is a story of planning, innovation, mobilisation, and sheer scale—one that will continue to shape the 21st century.

For Nigeria, China’s transformation offers more than inspiration—it provides tangible lessons in how to structure national development around long-term planning, inclusive growth, and strategic investment.

One of the takeaways is the necessity of long-term national planning that transcends political cycles. While China maintained decades of continuity in its development agenda, Nigeria has often struggled with policy inconsistency and the politicisation of development programmes. A focused, multi-decade plan—especially in areas like infrastructure, industrial policy, and agricultural modernisation—would provide the stability needed for sustainable progress.

China’s poverty alleviation strategy also demonstrates the power of data-driven, targeted intervention. Nigeria’s current poverty rate remains high, particularly in rural and conflict-affected regions. Rather than relying on generalised anti-poverty programmes, Nigeria could emulate China’s approach by identifying the specific causes and demographics of poverty at a household level. This would allow for precise policy responses—whether in the form of agricultural support, skills training, healthcare, or relocation assistance.

Infrastructure investment, especially in underserved rural areas, was a cornerstone of China’s success. Nigeria’s persistent infrastructure deficit continues to impede growth. Learning from China, future investments should aim not just at urban megaprojects but also at connecting remote communities to economic opportunities through improved roads, electrification, and digital connectivity.

Agriculture reform is another key area. China’s decision to give farmers more autonomy and market access significantly increased rural incomes. Nigeria, with vast arable land and a large rural population, can replicate this by securing land tenure, supporting mechanisation, and investing in agricultural extension services and rural agribusiness.

Moreover, China’s use of Special Economic Zones to attract investment and build manufacturing capacity offers a template Nigeria can adapt. Nigeria’s own SEZs have been hampered by poor infrastructure and regulatory uncertainty. A renewed focus on making these zones viable—through governance reforms and better integration into national industrial policy—could catalyse job creation and export growth.

Another critical lesson lies in the prioritisation of education and technology. China’s rapid ascent in high-tech industries was no accident—it was the product of sustained investment in STEM education and innovation ecosystems. Nigeria must similarly prioritise education, research, and digital infrastructure to unlock the potential of its young, tech-savvy population.

Perhaps most crucially, China’s success hinged on coordinated governance—clear roles for central and local governments, and strict accountability. Nigeria’s federal structure presents both an opportunity and a challenge. Building more effective collaboration between federal, state, and local authorities will be essential to translating policy into tangible outcomes.

Finally, just as China transitioned from poverty eradication to rural revitalisation, Nigeria must also think beyond survival. It must build systems and institutions that foster sustainable prosperity, equitable growth, and social cohesion. Only then can it ensure that gains made today are not lost tomorrow.

In adapting these lessons, Nigeria does not need to replicate China’s model wholesale. Its political system, cultural diversity, and democratic framework are distinct. But the underlying principles—strategic vision, disciplined execution, targeted investment, and inclusive development—are universally applicable. If Nigeria can internalise and apply these, it will own its transformation story.

"Umuada: How Igbo land’s powerful sisterhood terrifies women, silences men (II)","Mourners begging the Umuada of their community for forgiveness over alleged abandonment of their deceased mother when she was alive

Despite its peacekeeping mission and role as a custodian of culture, rights advocates have called for the sensitisation of Umuada leaders against upholding patriarchal norms and being at the forefront of woman-to-woman violence, as evident in widowhood practices and the excessive use of force as a means of control, writes GODFREY GEORGE in this second part of a two-part series

Between fear and pride

For some, the Umuada remain nothing short of lionesses, unyielding guardians of justice and cultural order.

In his recollection, a Facebook user, Chijioke Okoli, spoke with pride about his maternal home, where the Umuada reigned as a formidable force.

“They are lionesses who are strong in wealth and activities,” he said, describing women with nicknames like Oche Eze Nwanyi, Lady Gold, Ada eji eje mba, and Egodimma. His late mother, once the Secretary-General, was known as Lady Bomber or China Umu Agbala.

“I dare say the Umunnas listen to them. They are the pillars and shakers of the father’s land. Among them are former and present commissioners, retired permanent secretaries, lecturers, and top businesswomen who are billionaires in their own right.”

Okoli remembered a burial where the Umuada turned grief into reckoning.

The deceased, an elderly woman, had allegedly died of neglect at the hands of her children.

“Early that morning, before the clergy could begin, the women gathered, wielding firewood. They demanded that the children bring out the ‘meat’ they had killed, so they could roast and eat. Wearing gloves and nose masks, they sang songs, calling the children murderers. The burial could not be held. Not even the priest nor the Umunnas could stop them.”

It was not a mere spectacle. It was an indictment, a cultural trial. For hours, the children knelt, begging for forgiveness before the burial was allowed to proceed.

“If there is one thing I am proud of in my maternal home,” Okoli added, “it is these powerful women. My mom would be so proud of them.”

Others echo this reverence. Another Facebook user, Prince Jonathan Chuks, remembered how, as a boy, the Umuada intervened in the home of a neighbour notorious for battering his wife.

“One very early morning, before the man could wake up, they all gathered in his compound with a cane. The beating that man received that day from his bed brought back some sense into him. That incident ended the fights in that household to date.”

For him, such interventions proved the Umuada were indispensable. He added, “This circle should never be abolished because they are really doing an amazing thing to see that society gets better.”

But where Okoli and Chuks saw heroism, others remembered only the chaos.

Asadu Chinelo recalled her grandmother’s burial, when the Umuada insisted on a goat at 1 am.

“The kind kata kata (hassle) that unfolded before a goat was brought that night was indescribable. It was war. My aunties cried.”

Okoli, responding to her, explained: “They strike usually when something is going wrong. Their demands are a way of stifling people who may want to claim to be above traditions.”

For Alex Chuks, the memory of his grandfather’s burial is coloured by humiliation.

“These women came with chaos that night, demanding all of the cow heads (isi ewu). Nobody said a word. Even my dad was mute. I can’t forget that day.”

Others have learned to tread carefully. An actor, Cyriacus Ozoemena, remembered his mother’s burial as a seamless experience only because he obeyed her dying counsel: to respect the Umuada and meet their demands without hesitation.

“They even pitied me as the only son not to do certain things, but I told them that I loved my mom so much and if there’s anything needed, they should let me know, and I would find a way. The burial was a success.”

For Ozoemena, their presence was not a threat but a shield. The highlight of the day, he recalled, was when he and his sister were called upon to dance for their mother. The Umuada showered them with money, sealing the day with their approval.

Across testimonies, one thing is clear: whether feared or celebrated, the Umuada still wield a power that bends families. Their authority provokes admiration in some and resentment in others, but never indifference.

In defence of Umuada

Controversy has recently shadowed the Umuada, yet to understand their authority and recent public actions, it is important first to listen to how they describe themselves and the work they do.

At the Lagos branch of the Umuada Igbo Organisation, the group’s own statement underscores this purpose.

As the branch note reads, “The crest also carries the inscription Umuada Nma Nma, a phrase that loosely translates as ‘daughters of beauty,’ underscoring the pride and identity that members attach to their collective heritage.”

The statement continues, “The organisation’s stated mission is to foster peace and unity among Igbo women everywhere, and to invest time, efforts, and resources into initiatives that benefit its members.

“It also commits to promoting Igbo culture, values, and traditions, pledging to safeguard, uphold, and enhance these within wider society. Another part of its stated mandate is the encouragement and promotion of family values, which it identifies as the bedrock of a stable community.”

Such words matter. They place the Umuada within a framework of cultural stewardship, mutual support, and public service. They describe a network that sees its role as preserving identity, strengthening family ties, and creating platforms for mentorship, education, and empowerment.

The organisation’s own vision and objectives make the case explicit.

In a May 18, 2025, post, Agbaranwanyi Ngozika Nneochie wrote of a meeting that “has been made yet another remarkable day in the history of Ogbako Umuada Odinana Igbo Cultural Association” and announced an engagement with HRH Omu Onyebuchie Okonkwo that “has again opened another door of opportunity for the accomplishment and realisation of the vision of this organisation.”

She went on to list the association’s aims: “To promote the true Odinana woman; to make the world know about the Igbo traditional woman; to bring back the true power of womanhood in Odinana Igbo; to bring back the sidelined traditions in Igbo land; to empower the Igbo girl child to be independent.”

People misunderstanding Umuada – Imo excos

At the Mbaise branch of the Umuada society, two of its executives expressed frustration over what they described as “growing misconceptions” about the role of the group in Igbo communities.

One of the women, who declined to give her name, insisted that the Umuada remain the moral compass and custodians of Igbo tradition.

“You don’t disobey nature. We are nature. We are the mothers,” she declared, her voice firm. “If we say, ‘do this,’ we know what we are saying. We are custodians of tradition. If we allow you people to do as you like, things will spoil in Igbo land.”

For her, the society’s role is not merely symbolic but deeply practical, ensuring that families and communities do not deviate from long-established norms. She described this oversight as both a responsibility and a sacred calling.

Another executive, who introduced herself simply as Mrs Chinwe, offered more pointed examples.

According to the woman, who is also a chief, Umuada in Mbaise often intervene in disputes between young wives and their in-laws.

“How can a young girl who is married into our community be maltreating her mother-in-law? It’s not done, na,” she said. “We will send her packing. We will teach her a lesson. Even the police know that this one is a family affair.”

She narrated a recent incident that, to her, underscored why the Umuada cannot relent.

“The other day, I learnt that a woman was caught in adultery. That is an abomination. It is like you want us to pamper this generation. This is tradition,” she said, shaking her head. “We have even soft-pedalled on a lot of things. It’s what is keeping Igbo society together.”

Why Umuada are respected in Igbo land – Ohanaeze

The weight of the Umuada institution in Igboland is not in doubt, a fact underscored by cultural leaders who continue to hold them in reverence despite the sometimes controversial methods of enforcing their authority.

A titled chief and former spokesperson for the foremost Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Dr Alex Ogbonnia, described the group as “peacemakers” who preach truth and love in their families, and whose impartiality has earned them deep respect across generations.

“They are also character moulders in various ways,” Ogbonnia explained. “Because they maintain a strong emotional attachment to their maiden families, each time the community gathers for any occasion, the Umuada are given a special role to play. If you kill a cow, from the lower limb down is given to the Umuada.”

That authority, he stressed, extends beyond symbolic gestures into the practical management of community affairs. Whether at marriages, funerals, or disputes, the Umuada’s stance is decisive.

“They also have their interventionist role, so when there is chaos, whatever stance they take is always respected. It’s a formidable and coordinated institution that cannot be bought with money, and no one can defy the authority of the Umuada as it is in Igboland today,” Ogbonnia said.

He admitted that modernity has altered their operations but has not eroded their influence.

The biggest change, he noted, lies in issues of distance and intermarriage. Many women now live far from their maiden homes and cannot attend to family matters as regularly as before.

Ogbonnia, a lecturer of Political Science at Godfrey Okoye University, argued that it was always wiser to avoid provoking the Umuada and instead, honour the traditions they uphold. For him, their role mirrors “the female psychology.”

This sometimes creates tension between their actions and formal law.

“Many things they are doing now are not all that are within the purview of the law, but inasmuch as they are against the law, they are customary. They are the customs of the community. That is where the customs of the community and law run contrary to each other,” Ogbonnia observed.

Umuada govt, serious matter – Varsity don

For a Senior Lecturer of Political Science at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Dr Ugwueze Ikechukwu, what is often described as the “women’s government” in Igboland is no trivial matter.

In his words, it is “a very serious and unbreakable government.” His advice to men is simple: “The best thing for us, men, is to run away, because it is the best strategy available. The story will not be the same if it were men doing such a thing or if men were involved in such acts. But when it’s women-to-women, it is women’s business.”

To buttress his point, he recalled a case from a neighbouring village where a wife was accused of maltreating her husband.

“It was the village women, in one of their monthly meetings early in the morning, that moved in a group and insisted that the abusive wife must go. In fact, the husband didn’t resist because it was like helping him. This was women-to-women,” he said.

For him, such an episode demonstrated the force of female solidarity. “Women know themselves, and so their government is always very strong and unbreakable. If you interfere, you may end up returning home to worse calamity.”

While conceding that excesses exist, Ugwueze insisted that the Umuada seldom act without due process.

“People overdo things sometimes, but what I find difficult about navigating a terrain of this nature is that nothing goes for nothing. There cannot be smoke without fire.

As far as I know, the Umuada society is not one where decisions are taken without following due process and follow-up for a reasonable period of time. We know that some might be unlucky to be perceived the way they are not. But, in most cases, their judgment is always as it is, if not near-perfect.”

He was particularly critical of widowhood rites, calling them a violation of natural justice. “If you are not living in your village, you should know what is going on. What I have a problem with is the widowhood rites, where people shave their hair and drink the water used in bathing the corpse. It has been an age-long practice amongst these people, but it is against the laws of natural justice and fairness,” he concluded.

Seek redress – FIDA

For the spokesperson of the International Federation of Women Lawyers, Mrs Philomena Neji, the influence of the Umuada has waned compared to what it once was.

“I don’t think it’s still as much as it used to be. I may be wrong. Over the years in Igboland, they usually come up more in some traditional setups, like when women lose their husbands or during traditional marriages. There is always a space where their attention is needed.

For me, just like the issue of patriarchy, all these things are given space, but it’s no longer how it used to be,” she explained.

Neji noted that in the past, the Umuada’s demands were much more rigid. “They used to insist, for instance, that a woman shave her hair when she lost her husband. But it is no longer business as usual,” she said.

According to her, such practices now face increasing pushback under the law.

“For FIDA, things like that are not allowed because, when reported, the law will always take its course. We have the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act, and we have been clamouring for it to be domesticated in several states of the federation. It’s not always enough that we have laws, but effective implementation is key.”

On the broader question of culture and rights, Neji was clear: “Of course, we know that culture is inevitable. At the same time, any culture that is repugnant to good conscience, equity and fairness, we clamour for that to be expunged.”

She urged people to step forward with complaints when cultural demands crossed into abuse.

“Everything is based on evidence. People should report these cases so they can be taken up,” she added.

Umuada practices must align with the law – SAN

Life Bencher and former Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Prof. Joy Ngozi Ezeilo (SAN), traced the Umuada institution to its deep cultural roots.

According to her, these women were entrusted as custodians of tradition in Igbo communities, but that responsibility has often been stretched to troubling ends.

“It becomes problematic when that power is used to perpetrate gender-based violence, especially against women. It requires a lot of sensitisation, and we have been doing that as Igbo women,” she explained.

Ezeilo described the dynamic as a form of “bargaining patriarchy.”

“In this system, women feel important all of a sudden, and this importance conferred on them by men is used as an instrumentality to reinforce social norms, sex stereotypes, and gender-based violence and discrimination against women. These are part of the system, and they don’t even see it,” she said.

To her, the internalisation of gender roles lies at the heart of the matter. “They have internalised their being as the other sex and their role as custodians of maintaining the culture of the family that they are originally from.

The concept of Umuada is that it is in your parents’ house that you are an Umuada or Nwa Ada. When you are Nwa Ada, you feel you have certain privileges, and they are respected. So, they use that to maintain whatever they see as the culture and follow it to the letter.”

She argued that cultural attachment alone cannot justify harmful practices.

“We need a transformation of social norms and an emphasis on eliminating gender-based violence. We need to continue engaging with the Umuada as cultural leaders.

Gender-based violence or violence against women and girls, under whatever guise, be it cultural practices or tradition, is flawed. It is against international and regional treaties, most of which Nigeria is a signatory to,” the professor of law added.

Courts, Ezeilo noted, have repeatedly struck down some of Umuada’s actions.

“Many courts have pronounced some of these acts by the Umuada as illegal. Education is what is required. There is a precinct ecology upon which the Umuada ecology is founded. So, you have to really engage with them, with traditional rulers, and with the men who gave the women these powers.”

She recalled incidents that exposed the severity of their authority.

“There was a burial of a popular activist of blessed memory, where, because the widow refused to shave her hair, the Umuada refused to eat, and they moved out. This was to nullify the burial. It was a big impasse with regard to the continuation of the funeral.

That is the way they do these things. Somewhere in Anambra, there is a case. The Umuada preside over any case in their families. And even non-Igbos are affected. Imagine insisting that a woman must stay overnight with the corpse of her husband because ‘it is tradition’.”

For her, such practices should no longer stand unquestioned.

“What the Umuada do must be in accordance with the law. Ignorance of the law is not an excuse. This is violence perpetrated against women by fellow women,” the don added.

Sensitisation needed

Ezeilo, who was a United Nations Special Rapporteur and founder of Women Aids Collective (widely known as WACOL), stressed that the Umuada system could not be detached from the broader structures of patriarchy that created it.

“This is to tell you that men are implicated. The men act like they are not in charge. Fines are imposed, and these women, if they refuse to pay, are ostracised from their communities,” she noted.

For her, the solution lies in rights-based engagement.

“Fundamental human rights must be respected. That is why we have to engage in sensitisation and dialogue. We need vanguards who will stand as watchdogs. And a woman who sits in that honourable position.”

Resistance to the Umuada, she explained, already exists in some spaces.

“Some religious groups are resisting them. Some have won, some have not. Some matters have gone to court, and there have been a lot of victories.

“The court will always uphold fundamental human rights. Some practices have even been criticised by the Supreme Court, such as in Ukeje v. Ukeje, where it was upheld that women can now inherit properties left by deceased relatives.”

For Ezeilo, the path forward is clear: “It starts with sensitisation and ends with action.”",https://punchng.com/umuada-how-igbo-lands-powerful-sisterhood-terrifies-women-silences-men-ii/,https://punchng.com
Lagos residents drown in soaring rents amid weak housing policy,"As rent prices soar out of control in Lagos, families face the threat of homelessness amid an unregulated housing market, writes IBRAHIM ADAM

On a cloudy Tuesday evening, Adeola (second name withheld), a former civil servant with the Lagos State government, sank wearily into his chair after another exhausting day at work and dozed off.

He was jolted out of his brief moment of respite by the sound of his phone.

On the other end was his landlady, her tone flat, her words heavy with finality. What she said next threatened the fragile stability he had spent years building for his family.

For years, Adeola had paid N200,000 for a modest two-bedroom flat in a densely populated suburb. But in just one phone call, the cost of keeping a roof over his family’s head tripled, and suddenly, the threat of eviction felt more real than ever.

“The rent is now N600,000, the landlady told me without an explanation or any form of apology,” he told Sunday PUNCH.

As an ambitious man, Adeola is no stranger to change. His new work often demands sudden transfers across states, and most recently, he moved from Lagos to Bauchi state, a relocation which he had to manage entirely on his own. Amid every challenge, Lagos remained unwavering, the steady home for his wife and children.

“I am a former public servant in Lagos state and I am always ready for growth. The nature of my new work could take me anywhere in the country at any time. I wouldn’t want to be going about with my family, so I keep an apartment in Lagos for them, a simple two-bedroom flat.

“My landlady increased the house rent from N200,000 to N600,000, a 300 per cent hike in this kind of economy. As a former civil servant, how much is our salary? Even with the new job, how much am I earning? A former colleague of mine on Level 10 is going through the same thing,” Adeola, who is yet to absorb the shock, said.

What pained him the most was not just the shocking increase but the timing, which left him devastated.

“The notice is very short, especially since my current rent will not even expire until October 2025. I am devastated. I don’t even get up to a 30 per cent increase in my salary.”

Adeola’s experience mirrors the nightmare faced by thousands of tenants in Lagos, where annual rent increases are squeezing families, civil servants, traders, and young professionals into financial despair.

The burden goes beyond the rent itself; agreement, commission, legal, and agent fees can add hundreds of thousands of naira to already crushing costs.

For many tenants, it feels like a cycle designed to trap them, one they can neither escape nor keep up with.

Against this backdrop, pressure is mounting on the Lagos State House of Assembly to intervene.

Earlier this year, Jubril Gawat, Senior Special Assistant on New Media to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, hinted in a post on X that rent regulation was “coming soon” and would be “well discussed and implemented” after deliberations.

His remark sparked hope, but also scepticism, among weary tenants desperate for relief.

Lagos tenancy bill

The Lagos State House of Assembly is currently reviewing a comprehensive tenancy bill that seeks to overhaul rent collection practices, regulate the operations of estate agents, define the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants, and streamline tenancy dispute resolution.

The proposed legislation, titled, “A Bill for a Law to Regulate the Relationship Between Landlords and Tenants, Including the Procedure for the Recovery of Premises in Lagos State, and for Other Connected Matters,” is set to repeal the Tenancy Law Cap. T1, Laws of Lagos State 2015.

Under the bill, it would be unlawful for a landlord or agent to demand from a sitting tenant more than three months’ rent in advance for a monthly tenancy, or more than one year for a yearly tenancy, regardless of the tenancy’s original terms.

Tenants, in turn, would also be prohibited from offering or paying rent beyond these limits.

Legal expert faults govt

Speaking with Sunday PUNCH, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Monday Ubani, criticised the Lagos State Government over housing scarcity, stating that it had failed to address the root causes of the crisis, particularly the rising cost of building materials and the non-implementation of housing policies.

He noted that housing affordability has become a major challenge across the country, especially in cities like Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt, where rents are increasingly out of reach for the average citizen.

The SAN also faulted successive governments for repeatedly announcing mass housing initiatives that rarely move beyond policy documents.

“The government must be fair and realistic in its approach,” he said. “One of the root causes of the high cost of housing is the rising price of building materials. If this issue is not addressed, laws dictating how landlords should rent their properties, such as limiting rent advances or fixing rent prices, will not solve the problem.”

Ubani urged the government to invest in affordable mass housing projects for low-income earners and ensure that building materials become more accessible.

According to him, if the government takes the lead, the private sector will naturally follow.

He also explained that the economic principle of demand and supply is at the heart of the crisis.

“When demand for housing exceeds supply, the price will always rise. It is the scarcity of affordable housing that makes rent very expensive. Unless the government increases housing stock practically, rent control laws will remain ineffective and difficult to enforce, “ he said.

Ubani warned that forcing landlords to cut rent without addressing prevailing high construction costs was unrealistic, describing such a move as “scratching the surface.”

He maintained that only by confronting the causes of scarcity and affordability can the government achieve meaningful results in solving the nation’s housing challenges.

Property Consultant, Mathias Ibikunle, also lamented that rent disputes would persist as long as living costs remained high.

He said, “For as long as costs continue to rise across the board, landlords will continue to jack up rents, and for as long, disputes will continue to arise between landlords and their tenants.”

Ibikunle added that he was not aware of any landlord being prosecuted or convicted in the last decade for arbitrarily increasing rent.

“I am not aware of any landlord who has been prosecuted and convicted in the last 10 years for increasing the rent on his house,” he said.

The consultant further noted that despite the existence of laws, rents had risen by more than 100 per cent in both low- and highbrow areas of the state.

Citing areas like Surulere, Itire, Ago Palace Way in Okota, and Ojo as examples where rent hikes had become unimaginable, he lamented, “I am, however, aware that house rents have increased by more than 100 per cent in both low- and highbrow locations in the state despite the laws.”

Supporting this position, land and property surveyor Sola Enitan, attributed the trend to broader economic factors, adding that the government could not legislate over what it did not control.

“You cannot legislate on what you don’t have control over. These properties are not government-owned; they belong to private developers,” he said.

Enitan, who is also a lawyer, maintained that tenancy laws could not stop rent hikes in Lagos or elsewhere because the government was not providing viable alternatives.

He said, “The government cannot legislate for developers who build their houses with bank credit. Naturally, they would want to recoup their investment quickly to avoid piling pressure and interest on the loan.

“Laws will not work where inflation has pushed the prices of building materials to the rooftop, and the government doesn’t seem to have a solution to that.”

Lawmakers speak

During a one-day public hearing at the Lateef Jakande Auditorium in the Assembly complex, Speaker of the House, Mudashiru Obasa, represented by the Chairman of the House Committee on Information, Stephen Ogundipe, warned that any agent collecting above the five per cent agency fee cap would face stiff penalties.

Other punitive measures include refunding the excess, paying a fine of N1m, or facing up to two years’ imprisonment.

He condemned the exploitative service charges imposed by some landlords and agents, describing them as worrisome.

Obasa emphasised that the bill would restore investor confidence in the real estate sector, attract new financiers, and create opportunities for large-scale housing development by private investors.

“The new bill currently under consideration by the House is designed to protect the rights of both tenants and landlords. It will also reduce disputes and remove barriers to large-scale housing development by private investors.

“If passed into law, the bill will put an end to many of the recurring controversies between landlords and tenants. It will promote mutual understanding, clearly define rights and obligations, and ensure peaceful co-existence,” the Speaker said.

Lawmaker representing Ojo Constituency and Chairman of the House Committee on Housing, Olusegun Ege, while speaking on the bill, explained that it is divided into four parts and contains 45 clauses covering tenancy agreements, rent payments, rights and obligations, and dispute resolution.

He noted that the bill encourages mediation as the first step in resolving disputes, saving both parties time and money compared to lengthy court processes.

The bill also sets out clear eviction procedures to prevent arbitrary evictions, seeks to curb unreasonable rent increases, and proposes measures to fast-track justice delivery, including virtual hearings, weekend and public holiday proceedings, and electronic case filings.

The lawmaker assured, “We will go back, review the bill thoroughly, examine the memoranda, and make the necessary adjustments before it becomes law.”

On his part, the Lagos State Commissioner for Housing, Moruf Akinderu-Fatai, described the bill as a “fundamental” piece of legislation that directly affects residents’ livelihoods. He noted that it outlines the duties and rights of both parties, including specific provisions in Sections 8 and 9 detailing landlords’ obligations and tenants’ protections.

According to him, the proposed law seeks to address landlord–tenant disputes, promote fair rent practices, encourage investment in rental housing, and reduce the growing trend of developers opting to sell rather than lease properties.

Akinderu-Fatai added that the bill prioritises alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, empowering the judiciary to fast-track housing-related cases and clearly define the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders.

“The aim is to create a clear legal framework that prevents disputes from escalating into law-and-order crises,” the commissioner said.

Lagos State Commissioner for Justice, Lawal Pedro, described the proposed measure as a potential game-changer.

He said that by ensuring tenancy disputes are resolved within six months, the bill could put an end to an era where both defaulting tenants and landlords exploit the slow pace of court proceedings to their advantage.

Crushing weight on tenants

Meanwhile, life under the weight of rising rents continues to take a toll on Lagos residents. In neighbourhoods such as Agege, Surulere, Somolu, and Bariga, a room-and-parlour self-contained apartment now costs between N1m and N1.7m per year.

This excludes additional charges, such as agreement, commission, caution, and legal fees, which can amount to another N700,000 to N900,000.

In these places, single-room self-contained unit now rents for between N700,000 and N1.2m annually, with extra fees ranging from N500,000 to N700,000.

For Abimbola, a prospective tenant, the cost of securing a modest shop space in Lagos was simply shocking.

“The shop rent was N500,000, agreement N250,000, commission N250,000, caution N50,000, and agent fee N5,000,” she recalled. “Just this morning! I asked the agent if he could pay such an amount for that size of shop; he went silent.”

Another X user expressed similar frustration, questioning whether it was time to abolish or regulate some of these fees.

“Is there a way to abolish agreement and commission fees or, better still, set a standard rate? These charges are frustrating people,” he said, reflecting a growing call among tenants for fairness and transparency in Lagos’s chaotic rental market.

For many tenants, the yearly hike in rent has become a constant struggle.

Iya Alaiya, a tenant in Agege, recounted how her landlord raised the rent from N350,000 to N450,000 just last year, and she has already heard whispers of another increase coming next year.

She added that even at the shop where she sells her goods at Isale Oja in Agege, the landlord increases the rent by at least N5,000 every year without carrying out any form of renovation.

“It’s frustrating because the money keeps going up, yet nothing is being improved. We are just paying more for the same thing,” she lamented.

Social media personality Tunde Ednut recently posted on his Instagram page about a female tenant in Benin, Edo State, who was hit with a shocking rent increase from N350,000 to N700,000 within just one year.

Expressing his frustration, he wrote, “Things are already hard enough in this country, yet landlords keep increasing rents anyhow. Why make life even more difficult?”

The post triggered reactions from tenants across different parts of Nigeria, especially Lagos, who seized the opportunity to vent their anger over what they described as the unbearable burden of yearly rent hikes.

One tenant lamented, “It feels like we are just working to pay rent, only for the cycle to start all over again the next year. Sometimes, I just wish rapture would come already so everyone can go to their Father’s house, whether heaven or hell, because honestly, this can’t be what life is meant to be.”

Another frustrated by both low wages and high costs, quipped, “Even if the work dey? How much person dey earn monthly? Very soon, space no go dey road again because na to build a foldable tent and be carrying about. Anywhere night reaches, I go open the tent.”

Uju, another angered by the rising rent, recalled how her caretaker announced a staggering N200,000 increase with little regard for the tenants’ struggles.

“My caretaker added 200k for house rent this year. He just drove into the compound sometime in December last year, carried paper and served every flat, telling us to sign. Everybody Kukuma signed after reading the letter, and he just entered his car and drove away. The worst is that na we dey use our money dey maintain the house. If you like, call from now to eternity, he won’t come. He will only show his face whenever rent is due or he wants to increase it,” she said.

More tenants also raised concerns about exploitative practices by landlords, agents, and lawyers.

One said, “No jokes‼ Landlords, agents, and their lawyers are draining tenants. Tell me why tenants pay legal fees to a lawyer who represents the landlord? Tell me why we pay 20 per cent to agents and still pay an inspection fee just to see the house? Mind you, the agent does nothing for you after showing you the house—you are on your own! And is there no agent for property valuation and rent regulation?”

Landlords defend rent increases

Many landlords in Lagos remain defiant over soaring rents, insisting it is within their right to charge tenants at their discretion.

In Surulere, landlord told our reporter that if a prospective tenant refused to take his property at N1m, he could confidently increase the rent to N1.5m within a week and still find someone willing to pay.

A landlord in Ogba explained that soaring construction and maintenance costs are leaving property owners with limited options.

“Just a few years ago, a bag of cement sold for about N2,600; today it’s nearly N10,000. The price of iron rods has more than tripled, while maintenance expenses and property taxes continue to climb.

“If rents don’t reflect these realities, landlords risk operating at a loss. Many of us are struggling more than tenants often realise,” he said.

“This constant tension between affordability for tenants and sustainability for landlords has become a major challenge for policymakers in Lagos and across Nigeria, on how to design a legal and economic framework that protects tenants’ need for stability without ignoring the financial pressures on landlords.”

In Somolu, another landlord was even more forthright.

“It is my house, and I will let it out at whatever price I choose. The government did not build this house for me. If you cannot pay N1.3m annually, you can look elsewhere,” he stated.

On social media, some landlords echoed these sentiments.

Cheryl deBlaq wrote, “I only collect rent and an agreement fee of N50,000. I don’t use agents. The Lagos laws favour tenants more than homeowners, and that’s why many property owners are selling or converting buildings into hotels.”

However, some landlords have admitted that arbitrary increases are exploitative. Omotoso Segun, a property owner in Lagos, did not mince words when he said many landlords have become “wicked shylocks” with the rents they demand.

“Some landlords are simply wicked shylocks with the amount they charge for rents in Lagos. The government must do something about landlords and their partners in crime, estate agents.”

Sanwo-Olu’s plea to landlords

Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu appealed to landlords not to use infrastructure improvements as an excuse to increase rents.

Speaking during the inauguration of rehabilitated roads in Agboyi/Ketu LCDA and Kosofe LGA, he urged landlords to act responsibly.

“Please don’t increase your house rents because Sanwo-Olu has just done connectivity. We are not doing it so you can put a burden on your tenants.

“The value of your houses might have gone up with the dual carriageway, but take it that this is our responsibility to you,” he said.

Meanwhile, in defence of the administration, Moruf Akinderu-Fatai, acknowledged the severity of Lagos’ housing crisis but argued that arbitrary rent hikes are not peculiar to the state, describing them as a nationwide challenge.

“The Lagos State Government is not unaware of this challenge. It is not peculiar to Lagos State, but also to the federation. We have been up and doing from day one under the administration of Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu,” he said.

According to him, one of the first measures taken was the completion of abandoned housing schemes scattered across the state.

“Not only have we concluded 21 schemes, but also the majority of these schemes are for low-income earners. Most of these schemes are sold far below market prices. The aim was to bring more people into the housing ladder.”

He emphasised that increasing the supply of affordable housing would help stabilise rental prices and reduce pressure on tenants.

However, he admitted that “market forces that favour landlords due to high demand and limited supply” remain a major challenge.

The commissioner also highlighted the multiple charges tenants face, which worsen their burden: “Agreement, commission, damages, and legal fees significantly inflate the overall rental expenses.”

To address this, he pointed to the Lagos State Real Estate Transaction Authority, set up to regulate housing activities and ensure fair transactions.

“The authority not only regulates transactions but also resolves issues within real estate transactions between landlords and tenants,” he added.

Akinderu-Fatai explained that the government had also introduced a rent-to-own scheme, which enables tenants to pay just five per cent upfront and spread the balance over ten years.

“There is a rent-to-own programme, which allows you to pay just 5 per cent and pay monthly over the next 10 years,” he said.

He said this initiative, alongside partnerships with private investors and the Federal Government’s Renewed Hope Housing Scheme, represents some of the administration’s strategies to shield tenants from exploitative charges.

The commissioner underscored the importance of vertical expansion, advocating for high-rise residential buildings to maximise space in a city where land is limited,adding, “Lagos must make a determined effort to go vertically and subsidise.”

Akinderu-Fatai also stressed that regulation of the real estate sector would remain a priority, and the authority has resolved numerous disputes, assisted residents in retrieving their investments, and prosecuted fraudulent agents.

“It is a major duty of the Lagos State Real Estate Transaction Authority to regulate this sector. They have been doing that for over five years now. Many unscrupulous people have been charged in court. Some are serving jail terms while others have been refunded.”

The tenancy bill explained

Under the new bill, prospective tenants are offered greater protection. It states that landlords or agents may not demand more than one year’s rent in advance, and tenants are equally prohibited from paying beyond that threshold.

Violators face a fine of N1m or imprisonment for up to three months. The bill also outlines specific default notice periods in cases where no formal agreement exists: one week for tenants at will, one month for monthly tenants, three months for quarterly or half-yearly tenants, and six months for yearly tenants.

In cases of rent default, landlords may serve a seven-day written notice to recover possession once the arrears period elapses.

For fixed-term tenancies, no notice to quit is required at the end of the agreed term unless renewed.

Meanwhile, estate agents will be subject to tighter controls under the law, as they must register with the Lagos State Real Estate Regulatory Authority and are prohibited from collecting rent from multiple prospective tenants for the same property.

They must also remit rent collected to landlords within seven working days unless otherwise directed in writing.

All rent collections must be receipted, and agency fees are capped at five per cent of one year’s rent. Violations, including unregistered practice, multiple collections for one property, or delays in remitting funds, could attract fines of up to N1m, repayment of unlawfully collected sums, imprisonment for up to two years, or both.

The bill also reinforces tenants’ rights, guaranteeing them peaceful and quiet enjoyment of their premises, privacy, exclusive possession, and reasonable use of common areas.

Tenants who carry out improvements with the landlord’s written consent are entitled to compensation for unexhausted improvements if the tenancy is later terminated.

Meanwhile, landlords retain the right to inspect the property with prior notice, ensure its lawful use, and demand service charges where applicable.

However, they are expressly prohibited from disturbing the tenant’s peaceful occupation through actions such as cutting off water or electricity, removing roofing sheets, locking out tenants, seizing property, or restricting access to personal belongings.

Procedures for serving notices are also clearly outlined. For residential premises, notice may be delivered personally, handed to an adult resident, affixed to the property, sent via courier, or, in the case of business premises, left with a responsible officer or at the registered office.

The bill exempts certain premises from its provisions, including staff housing provided by employers, student accommodation within educational institutions, emergency shelters, care or hospice centres, and hospital or mental health facilities that provide accommodation as part of treatment.",https://punchng.com/lagos-residents-drown-in-soaring-rents-amid-weak-housing-policy/,https://punchng.com
How science offers hope of regenerative possibilities to spinal patients,"The spine is often described as the backbone of human existence, both figuratively and literally. It provides structural support, enables mobility, and protects the spinal cord, which is central to communication between the brain and the rest of the body.

In Nigerian hospitals today, a growing number of patients are living without the full functionality of their spines.

Paralysis, resulting from spinal cord injuries and diseases, has become an alarming medical and social challenge. The situation compels urgent reflection on whether science can, in fact, “grow a spine” and what such a possibility might mean for Nigeria.

Spinal cord injuries are among the most devastating health conditions because they affect nearly every aspect of a person’s life. From loss of mobility to dependence on caregivers, victims face physical, emotional, and financial hardships.

Families are thrust into long-term caregiving roles, often without institutional support.

Health facilities, already burdened, struggle to provide comprehensive rehabilitation services. This reality highlights the urgency of exploring both preventive measures and advanced medical interventions.

The metaphor of “growing a spine” thus extends beyond medical science into the realm of policy, responsibility, and national development.

Causes of injury

The causes of paralysis and spinal cord dysfunction in Nigeria are multifaceted. Road traffic accidents remain the primary culprit. Nigeria’s roads are among the deadliest in the world, with reckless driving, poor infrastructure, and inadequate enforcement of traffic regulations combining to produce a high incidence of severe accidents.

Many of these accidents result in spinal fractures and injuries that leave victims permanently disabled.

In addition to road accidents, falls from height are a significant cause of spinal trauma. Construction workers, artisans, and even children are frequent victims of such accidents.

Industrial mishaps in factories and mines further contribute to the burden of spinal injuries.

Violence, including gunshot wounds and domestic assaults, also accounts for a proportion of paralysis cases, particularly in urban centres plagued by crime.

Beyond trauma, certain diseases remain key contributors. Poliomyelitis, though nearly eradicated, continues to leave survivors with spinal complications. Tuberculosis of the spine, a condition still prevalent in Nigeria, leads to progressive paralysis if untreated. Multiple sclerosis and other degenerative diseases, though less common, present additional challenges to the health system. Congenital conditions such as spina bifida further complicate the picture, adding to the population of those living with impaired spinal function.

Treatment options and limitations

Treatment for paralysis in Nigeria is far from comprehensive. Surgical interventions are often limited to stabilising the spine rather than restoring function.

Physiotherapy and rehabilitation are offered in a handful of centres, yet they are frequently underfunded, understaffed, and inaccessible to most patients. For accident victims in rural areas, rehabilitation services are almost absent.

The economic cost of treatment further compounds the problem. Families often exhaust their savings on surgeries, physiotherapy sessions, and mobility aids. Yet, despite such investments, patients may never regain independence. The long-term emotional toll on both patients and caregivers is severe, while the wider economy loses countless productive citizens to permanent disability.

Consultant Neurosurgeon at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Professor Friday Okon, captures the gravity of the situation:

“Over 60 per cent of paralysis cases we treat are due to accidents that could have been prevented through road safety compliance and better workplace standards.”

This observation underscores the dual challenge Nigeria faces: the need to prevent spinal injuries while simultaneously advancing treatment options for those already affected.

Scientific advances and the prospect of “growing a spine”

Globally, science is edging closer to the possibility of regenerating spinal function. Stem cell research, once viewed with scepticism, has shown promise in repairing damaged spinal tissues.

By transplanting stem cells into injured areas, researchers have achieved partial recovery of mobility in experimental models.

Clinical trials are ongoing in Europe, North America, and Asia, raising hopes that paralysis may one day be reversible.

In addition to stem cell therapy, 3D bioprinting and tissue engineering represent exciting frontiers. Scientists are experimenting with printing scaffold-like structures that can replace or support damaged sections of the spinal cord. Such innovations, though still in their infancy, hold the potential for reconstructing spinal tissues with remarkable precision.

Another promising development lies in neuroprosthetics and brain-computer interfaces. By bypassing the damaged spinal cord, these devices enable communication between the brain and the limbs, allowing paralysed patients to regain some degree of mobility. Exoskeletons, though expensive, have already been used to help patients stand and walk again.

Head of the Department of Regenerative Medicine at Cambridge University, Prof Helen Roberts, reflects on the significance of these developments:

“Growing a spine, in the regenerative sense, is no longer a fantasy but an emerging frontier of medicine that may redefine recovery for paralysis patients in the decades to come.”

Potential benefits to Nigeria

The implications of such breakthroughs are profound for Nigeria. With thousands of accident victims paralysed each year, regenerative medicine could drastically reduce the number of citizens confined to wheelchairs or dependent on caregivers. Restored mobility would mean restored independence, productivity, and dignity.

The economic benefits would also be substantial. Families would be spared the crushing financial burden of lifelong caregiving, while the workforce would be replenished with individuals once considered permanently disabled.

Medical Director of the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, Dr Samuel Aluko, points to the wider social impact by saying, “The capacity to regenerate spinal function would not only save lives but transform communities. It would mean fathers returning to work, mothers regaining independence, and children resuming education after accidents.”

The benefits extend beyond individual recovery. For Nigeria’s overstretched healthcare system, fewer long-term inpatients would free up hospital beds and reduce healthcare costs. Rehabilitation centres would be able to focus resources more effectively, while national productivity would rise. In a country where human capital is vital to economic development, such advancements could play a transformative role.

Challenges to realising benefits

Despite the promise, the road to regenerative solutions is fraught with challenges. Cutting-edge research in stem cells and bioprinting requires significant financial investment, specialised laboratories, and a skilled workforce; resources that are scarce in Nigeria.

The absence of consistent government funding for medical research further hampers progress.

Director-General of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure, Dr Oladipo Afolabi, voices concern over Nigeria’s readiness:

“Unless Nigeria invests in local scientific research and strengthens collaboration with global innovators, the benefits of regenerative medicine will continue to elude our health system.”

There are also ethical considerations. Stem cell research, particularly when derived from embryonic sources, has sparked debate worldwide. Nigeria must therefore develop robust ethical guidelines to regulate research without stifling innovation.

Another challenge lies in accessibility. Even if regenerative therapies become viable globally, the cost may be prohibitive for ordinary Nigerians. Unless policies are put in place to subsidise treatment, such breakthroughs risk being available only to the wealthy, thereby deepening inequality in healthcare access.

Importance of prevention

While waiting for scientific breakthroughs, Nigeria must prioritise prevention. Road safety campaigns, strict enforcement of traffic regulations, and investment in better road infrastructure are immediate interventions that could drastically reduce the incidence of spinal injuries. Workplace safety regulations must also be enforced to protect labourers in construction and industry.

Accident victims who suffer spinal cord injuries often face irreversible disability. Preventing these injuries not only saves lives but also reduces the long-term burden on families and the health system. Improved emergency response systems, including rapid evacuation and trauma care, could also reduce the severity of spinal injuries sustained in accidents.

Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon at Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Prof Musa Abdullahi, stresses the urgency of preventive measures:

“Every accident prevented is a spinal injury avoided. Prevention is the most cost-effective intervention Nigeria can implement while waiting for science to catch up.”

Recommendations

To address the rising challenge of paralysis and spinal injuries, Nigeria must adopt a multipronged approach. First, the government must invest in research by funding local universities and teaching hospitals to collaborate with international partners. Establishing centres of excellence for regenerative medicine will position Nigeria to benefit from global innovations.

Second, the health system must expand affordable rehabilitation services. Establishing more rehabilitation centres, particularly in rural areas, will improve access for accident victims. Public-private partnerships can play a role in funding such facilities.

Third, preventive strategies must be enforced rigorously. Road safety education, improved traffic enforcement, and workplace safety regulations must become national priorities. Reducing accidents will directly reduce spinal injuries.

Lastly, policies must ensure equitable access to any future regenerative therapies. Subsidies, insurance schemes, and government support will be essential to ensure ordinary Nigerians benefit from such breakthroughs.

The metaphor of “growing a spine” speaks not only to the possibility of regenerating spinal function but also to Nigeria’s need for resilience and bold action. While medical science edges closer to making spinal regeneration a reality, Nigeria must act decisively in the present.",https://punchng.com/how-science-offers-hope-of-regenerative-possibilities-to-spinal-patients/,https://punchng.com
"Tears as gunmen kill father of five, spread terror in Kwara","Gunmen raids and kidnappings have left Kwara communities gripped by fear, with vigilantes battling heavily armed attackers as police investigations stall, DANIEL AYANTOYE writes

Thirty-nine-year-old Shade Ajiboye sat on a plastic chair in the sitting room of her family home in Rore, in the Ifelodun Local Government Area of Kwara State.

Her husband, Wale Ajiboye, a local security guard, had been killed days earlier when gunmen stormed the community at night.

“I never knew he would not return. He did not tell me this is how he would die,” she said as tears streamed down her face.

Clutching her youngest child, a one-year-old girl, in her arms, she asked, “Where will I start from with five children?”

The father of five (three boys and two girls) was killed by gunmen at his workplace.

For now, the people of Kwara live in the shadow of fear. Shade’s tears capture the human cost of the violence: families torn apart, children left without fathers, and widows left with impossible burdens.

Fear lingers in the community

When our correspondent visited the community on Sunday, the fear among residents was obvious.

The stillness of night in Rore has since been replaced by fright. Doors are locked earlier than usual, conversations are hushed, and the once-lively streets are now empty at dusk. Residents live in dread of the next attack.

The president of the Rore Development Association, Pastor Mike Oyedepo said, “It is a terrible thing because it is scaring people away. People who had ceremonies two weeks from this time are scared to come, especially the well-to-do among them. I have been receiving a lot of calls.

“One man told me he won’t come home again because of what is happening. We are praying that the government will come to our aid so that such a thing won’t happen again,” Oyedepo said.

But prayers alone may not be enough. At Rore, this reporter observed that the bulk of security rests on vigilantes and local hunters armed with Dane guns and crude rifles, which were no match for the sophisticated weapons of the attackers.

One vigilante, who insisted on anonymity, explained that the gunmen attack communities in the region with sophisticated weapons.

“We are the ones who go into the forest. The police and NSCDC will often say they cannot confront those criminals in the bush because it is not their job. If only we had access to such weapons, things would be much better. These people (gunmen) come late in the night and carry out their operations,” he said.

The wave of violence is not confined to Rore. In Kajola, Oke-Ero Local Government, residents avoid certain roads once dusk approaches.

Olaniyi Ayo, a commercial driver, described how the once-busy Kajola–Erinmope–Odo-Owa Road has become a trap.

“Everybody is now very careful. The rate of kidnapping is very serious. They target people, abduct them, and demand huge sums of money. From 6 pm, we no longer use that road because it has become too dangerous. You can either be attacked or kidnapped.”

Worrisome incidents

Across the state, the toll mounts. On June 4, two police officers were killed in Oreke-Okeigbo, Ifelodun LGA, while a Chinese national and a Nigerian were abducted.

Less than three weeks later, on June 22, three more lives were lost in Okuta, Baruten LGA, after gunmen stormed a home and sparked a deadly gun battle.

The pattern has been grimly consistent: blood, abductions, unanswered questions.

In Lade Ward of Patigi, a Peoples Democratic Party ward chairman, his son, and another villager were murdered, while a 12-year-old, Hassana Abdullahi, was snatched from her Fulani settlement.

By August, the attacks worsened, two killed in Ganmu village, three abducted, two others seized at Baba Ramo Fulani Camp near Isanlu-Isin, and most chilling, the killing of 45-year-old Alhaji Dahiru inside a mosque during evening prayers in Patigi.

The Fulani community in Rore has not been spared. Their leader, Tairu Abdullahi, recalled how his own father and brother were once kidnapped in Kajola.

“These kidnappers come in from 7 pm to 7:30 pm to strike. We arranged our hunters and went to ambush them along Idofin. We got there, and they ran away, but the victims were freed,” he said.

Despite repeated assurances, residents say little has changed.

The Kwara State Police Command had, after several incidents, announced that tactical teams and intelligence units were combing forests to rescue abducted victims.

Yet, the killings and abductions persist.

Police spokesperson, SP Adetoun Ejire-Adeyemi, said investigations are ongoing and that the Commissioner of Police has ordered discreet probes to uncover those behind the violence.

But multiple attempts to get updates on earlier cases were met with silence, as calls and messages went unanswered.",https://punchng.com/tears-as-gunmen-kill-father-of-five-spread-terror-in-kwara/,https://punchng.com
Lack of security presence gave gunmen free passage – Rore leader,"President of Rore Development Association, Pastor Mike Oyedepo, shares his thoughts with DANIEL AYANTOYE on the investigation by the Police and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps on the killing of two people by gunmen, among other issues

There was an attack on your community recently; how did it happen?

Although nobody was there to give an account of what really happened, we had sporadic shooting around 12:30 am and 1:00 am, and no one could go out at that time. But early in the morning, people rushed to the place and saw two corpses, one in the compound and one outside the compound, including the security guard.

We could see bullet marks that nearly created holes in the house. We also saw how bullets fired by the gunmen destroyed a vehicle. The driver of the vehicle was also killed.

Do you think the gunmen were aiming to assassinate someone?

If they were armed robbers, they would have come with a vehicle. We were told they came with motorbikes, and based on the little video clip that was available, they wore masks. They gained entrance to the compound; one entered through the fence and opened the gate for his gang members outside.

They had killed the man before the camera could pick it up. The man was in a pool of his own blood. Then they attempted to break down the door to the main house with a big stick, but didn’t succeed. They had killed two people. The third person, who escaped with wounds, is currently receiving treatment.

What happened thereafter?

As early as possible, the police were called, and they came to evacuate the corpses to the mortuary. They (police) also told us that an investigation had started. We (members of the Rore Development Association) are meeting on the security issue and how to tackle it because this man had a security guard there but they overpowered and killed him.

For now, we cannot ascertain whether they are armed robbers, assassins, or kidnappers because nobody heard anything from them during the attack. The people who would have been able to say something had been killed, and the other young man, who escaped, had gunshot wounds and ran away.

What is the level of security presence in this community?

There is the Civil Defence post; there are only two officers there. What will two officers do in 24 hours? One is the head, and the other is the assistant. That very day, the gunmen stormed the community, but none of them was around. The other one is the police outpost; we have one there.

That one seldom comes to work. So, there is no security except our local hunters and the vigilantes. The community is in the hands of God. We have been told there are no officers to cover all towns and villages, and that is why they gave us one officer—a woman. So, even if these people were on duty, what would they have done?

Tell us about the owner of the house that was attacked.

The owner of that house has done a lot for this community. He constructed between four to five boreholes in this community alone. He donated N1m during the launch of mosque construction.

At the secondary school in the community, he attempted to construct a borehole twice, spending millions of naira, but the borehole didn’t work. He lives in Ara-Orin, and there is no contribution going on there that he won’t be part of.

He is an easy-going man and lives a simple life. He has a house here (Rore) and another in Ara-Orin. There is hardly anything we do that he does not participate in.

If you have a personal problem and you talk to him, he is always ready to help, and we always hold community meetings together.

While it is painful for the lives we lost, we thank God that nothing happened to him. It is so painful that this security guard died. He loved him so much. Since this incident happened, he has been crying. Also, the driver who was killed is from Ara-Orin. The gunmen opened fire on him while he was on the way to a place.

Before the incident, what was the situation in this community?

It was so peaceful. The Rore community is a loving village where you have lots of indigenes and non-indigenes and different tribes peacefully coexisting.

There is a Fulani settlement in this community and there have been issues of herders-farmers clash, and some believe the Fulani were the ones that are responsible for violent crimes in Kwara South. What is your take on this?

What is hidden from man is known to God. They have not been causing us serious problems except for the issue of destroying farms with their cows. It is worse when the younger ones among them are rearing animals, and we have met with them several times on the issue.

Also, they are not settled with the situation because they are being attacked as well, because of what happened at Eleyin, where the attackers went to their (Fulani) camp and took five or six people away. They equally ran away from their place. It is wrong for anybody to jump to the conclusion that it must be an attack from the Fulani people.

Why were you attacked?

In the morning after the incident, a lot of people gathered; they were angry, saying that the wood that was used to attempt to break into the house might belong to them (Fulani). I asked how they came to that conclusion. Everybody buys mortar from the same place. How can you say this one resembles your own?

I don’t think anybody should be nailed because you can’t say for certain who the gunmen are. I was attacked by youths from the other community who were threatening that they would turn the Rore community to ashes because one of their own was killed, and I told them to stop saying that, but they attacked me.

Thank God our youths were there; they saved me. I didn’t blame them. They lost somebody from their community; we also lost somebody. It was not their target, and those people killed were not their targets. It was a coincidence, so why would they say it was the Rore community that caused the problem and that they would raze the community to the ground?

Since the incident, what actions has the community taken?

We have been calling on our people and holding meetings on how we are going to beef up security. In fact, the vigilantes and local hunters have been around since the incident happened.

The police said they had begun an investigation. What is the level of the investigation so far?

It is zero as far as I am concerned. We have not heard anything that has been done since the incident happened.

You mean the commissioner of police and others have not visited this community since the incident happened four days ago?

The DPO was here. In fact, they were the ones who took the corpse to the mortuary, and I was with him twice. They said they were investigating the matter. May God help them to unravel those behind the attacks.",https://punchng.com/lack-of-security-presence-gave-gunmen-free-passage-rore-leader/,https://punchng.com

There have been security challenges in this area, and some people blamed the Fulani. What can you say about it?

This thing (attacks) has been happening everywhere in this region. In fact, they kidnapped my daddy and brother in Kajola. We have also not rested but have consistently engaged with them and rescued people twice.

These kidnappers came in from 7 pm to 7:30 pm to strike. We arranged our hunters and went to ambush them along Idofin. We got there and they ran away, but the victims were freed. After a month, they came back and kidnapped our aged father. We called our hunters and mobilised in Oko, Idofin, Ajuba, Isanlu-Isin, and Omu-Aran. Later, we rescued him. That is what has been happening.

Where were you when the incident occurred, and how did you hear about it?

I was asleep, and suddenly somebody told me that the incident had happened in Rore. While we were planning to come to the scene, we saw the youths accusing us of being behind the attack and the killing of their people.

They beat up our Imam. It turned into a big problem. We had to call Omu-Aran DPO to inform him of what was happening. We were surprised they would be pointing accusing fingers at us, who have lived in this Rore community for 60 years, and they know we don’t have any other work other than farming and rearing cows.

Only a few of us put our children in schools. If it were other places, we would have been claiming that we are also indigenes because of the time span that we have co-existed peacefully. It is not that they ever caught us stealing apart from the issue of cows eating their crops. They called us killers, saying we were responsible for the attack, so much so that they posted it on Facebook.

But who are the killers?

We are not killers, and like I told you, we have been in this community for 60 years, and we are happy to be here. These people who are doing these things are not our people, and we don’t know them.

Your people joined other guards and hunters in Rore and other communities to comb the forest where the attackers who killed the two people in Rore were suspected to have fled. What was the outcome?

This morning (Sunday), the children went hunting, and they said they saw two people wearing pullovers beside the bush, and we sensed that, with all that is happening, it might be the kidnappers. So, we called our hunters who had gone to Idofin because another incident had happened there.

We agreed that before we should send the hunters into the bush to hunt, that was how they arrested the man. But from the findings, it was discovered that he is not a kidnapper but was just going about his normal business. A witness testified that the man is his brother.

What have you done to bring an end to the destruction of farms by your cows?

We are putting things in order. You are aware that the issue has been there for a long time. If you put okra on the table and the goat gets there, what you do is to pursue it. That is the same thing with cows. Anybody rearing animals is rearing complaints because complaints will always come. It is the cow owners who will be patient with it.",https://punchng.com/fulani-not-behind-kwara-killings-were-victims-too-community-leader/,https://punchng.com
Nigeria now Africa’s biggest HPV vaccine market – MSD MD,"Zweli Bashman, the Managing Director of MSD for South Africa and the sub-Saharan Africa region, a global healthcare leader working to help the world be well, speaks with LARA ADEJORO on its prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, consumer care, animal health products and innovative health solutions

You gave a presentation on “Accelerating the End-to-End Elimination of Cervical Cancer in Nigeria” at the Africa Health Business conference. Give us a synopsis of your presentation.

We had quite an insightful session at the Africa Health Business symposium. What we do at these meetings is to create platforms for local stakeholders and role players to present, share ideas, and have robust engagements. It’s not necessarily a platform where we go and give our perspective. So we had participants from the health care practitioner community, the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, as well as participants from the private health care providers in the country. The focal point of the discussion was that cervical cancer is a major scourge, particularly across sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria, specifically, has the highest number of cases – about 12,000 per year. Also, about 8,000 deaths occur due to cervical cancer. Globally, Nigeria is seventh on the list of countries with the highest incidence of cervical cancer. So, it was important that we create that platform, share our thoughts, but also congratulate the leadership for the incredible strides that they’ve made in terms of the HPV vaccine immunisation programme.

The first discussions around the introduction of a cervical cancer national control plan in Nigeria happened around 2014/ 2015. The immunisation program was launched in 2023. Between 2023 and now, 14 million girls have been vaccinated against HPV. That is incredible. In such a short period of time, Nigeria has become the biggest volume contributing market from an HPV vaccine perspective. And the basis of our discussion yesterday was around how to escalate or speed up progress into the next year. We need to start talking about vaccinating, what we call availing vaccination, to mid-adult women, women who are in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, because they are also at risk. We need to start talking about how we expand vaccination to boys, because boys are also carriers of the HPV virus. And we also need to talk about how we create viable avenues and channels for the introduction of better technology vaccines, like the nonavalent vaccines that are utilised in the Western world. And certainly, I think all those messages landed, and there’s a high degree of alignment among all stakeholders around what needs to be done.

You mentioned that boys are also carriers of the HPV virus? That sounds strange.

I can’t go into the medical technicalities as I’m not a medical doctor. But I have been vaccinated myself. We have to take the discussion away from the gender peculiarities and stop asking questions such as: “Why are you vaccinating girls? Why aren’t you vaccinating boys?” Let us talk about protection and providing protection where it’s needed the most. I am always encouraged by some of the countries on the continent and how they, against all odds, initiate relevant programmes. For example, we collaborated with Cameroon about a year or two ago when they initiated boy vaccinations. We worked with them, provided them with information, and they rolled out the program. Their findings showed that the introduction of a gender-neutral vaccination program increased their vaccine coverage rate as everyone eligible – boys and girls- got vaccinated. I think that we will see the benefits of those decisions in the next five to 10 years, when some of these diseases will no longer be subjects of discussion. I would like to give the context on why we’re prioritising girls in Nigeria. Firstly, most ministries of health will elect a public program that targets girls aged 9 to 14 years because the biggest challenge is cervical cancer. Though the vaccine is approved for use by all genders, sometimes public health officials have to make decisions because of resource limitations, hence the prioritisation of girls ahead of boys. Another reason is that Nigeria, as we know, is eligible for Gavi, and the country receives the vaccines through a partnership with Gavi. At the moment, Gavi has not yet approved the use of its procurement channel for vaccination of boys.So, one of the reasons we brought in the private sector to the meeting we hosted was to advocate for an all-of-society approach. So whilst the Ministry of Health is vaccinating girls between the ages of nine and 14, you can also have partners within the private sector that also galvanise resources for the immunisation of boys and even adult women. So it’s not just the job of the government alone.

MSD is a leading global manufacturer of HPV vaccines. Cost will always affect access, especially in developing countries. What are you doing to ensure the vaccines are affordable?

We have a longstanding partnership with UNICEF and Gavi, through which we provide our HPV vaccines to over 30 countries on the African continent at deeply discounted prices, as we are conscious that access is critically important. It’s a flagship partnership. Last year, we reached approximately 17 million girls across the continent with the HPV vaccine. I rank it as the gold standard in terms of access-oriented partnerships with the ultimate aim of getting health care to the consumers that need it the most.

Another area of focus for MSD is innovative medicines. How important are these for the Nigerian healthcare system?

MSD, as an organisation, is wholly focused on leveraging the power of science and innovation to address specific unmet health care needs. If you look at our portfolio at the moment, one of our marquee portfolios is oncology, where we’ve got an immuno-oncology product. It’s the number one pharmaceutical product in the world. We successfully registered the product a few months ago here in Nigeria. We are in the process of rolling out, via a launch later this year, the other portfolio in the vaccines space. Our marquee vaccine, within the vaccine space, is the HPV vaccine, and we’ve spoken about how widely it is utilised. More pleasing for us is that when we look at the next five years, we see that the pipeline of products that we will bring to the market is incredibly pleasing. We have an upward of 60 different assets that we’re going to be bringing to the market across a multitude of therapeutic areas – oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, ophthalmology – dealing with a multitude of different products that we believe play a very specific role in terms of unmet health care needs. We’re also quite excited about the registration of our Respiratory Syncytial Virus vaccine by the Food and Drug Administration of the USA just a few weeks ago. RSV is a respiratory disease that predominantly affects infants. It is a big challenge across the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, going by statistics and how much it contributes to paediatric deaths. We are planning for an expedited rollout across the continent because it’s one of those assets that we believe will certainly make a lasting impact on our communities. The vaccine is for the pediatric space and for babies. Our business structure spans the entirety of sub-Saharan Africa. Within my cluster, I oversee about 47 countries, including South Africa. So, these launches will be happening not just in Nigeria but also in Kenya and Ghana. It will also happen in the French West African countries in the first quarter of next year. We’re rolling out in the Southern Africa cluster as well. So really, it’s a pan-continental approach.

Are your products tailored to the West African genomes, considering arguments that some of these medicines are not effective because the genomes are not compatible with those of West Africa?

We don’t play a role in deciding which products are used. It’s the actual health care practitioners and scientists of that particular country that make the assessment and choose which products to utilise. I am confident that our products, particularly on the HPV front, certainly meet the needs of the African market at large. These products go through an extensive assessment process at the regulators, where you provide very detailed dossiers with tons of clinical trial data. We are very confident that the information that was assessed by NAFDAC, which led them to give us the approval, was satisfactory in terms of the suitability of the product for the country and what they perceive will be the impact on patients. We also have a very robust clinical trial program where we really prioritise diversity within the clinical trials. Africa is growing in importance because it’s one of the most diverse populations across the world. We’re now increasing our clinical trial footprint beyond South Africa to countries in East Africa, namely Kenya, Uganda, and we are also looking at clinical trials and expanding our footprint to West Africa, in Nigeria and Ghana as well, because we must do trials on populations and understand the efficacy of our interventions on specific populations.

When the HPV vaccine was introduced, there were speculations of its ability to make women infertile. How safe is this vaccine?

The vaccine is 100 per cent safe. We undergo a robust preregistration clinical trial process and, within those clinical trials and registration processes, we’ve been able to show the safety of these vaccines. There is a challenge around vaccine phobia and misinformation, and it came up during the cervical cancer session, which we hosted on the sidelines of the Africa Health Business symposium. I think it’s one of those things that we have to deal with as a result of the advent of social media. And I think it’s the responsibility of ourselves, the regulators, policy makers, and healthcare practitioners to, wherever possible, share educational, material information to ensure that people can decipher for themselves and make the right healthcare decisions. But certainly, I think we are very confident in the safety of our vaccines. The Nigerian HPV vaccination program is fairly new. But HPV vaccination programs have been in existence across the world in many countries. The oldest vaccine program in Africa is in Rwanda, and there’s still quite a healthy birth rate in Rwanda. So if we say the proof is in the pudding, I’m just saying, across the world, we have not seen any evidence of infertility amongst women who have taken the HPV vaccine.

What are the challenges to improved access to innovative medicines?

One of the challenges for the continent was the amount of time and effort that it took to register one product across a multitude of countries. Until recently, we effectively had 54 countries that had 54 different regulatory processes that required individual submission. There is no organisation or manufacturer with that level of breadth from a regulatory resource capacity with the capacity to roll out broad registrations. With the introduction of the African Medicines Agency, however, we are close to solving that problem. We recently participated in a pilot through the AMA where we submitted three products and managed to gain registration in close to 20 different countries simultaneously within the space of 12 months. That is one submission that has reached multiple countries, and we think that the scaling of that is really going to be one of the groundbreaking factors that will positively impact access. That’s why we’re able to sit in front of you today and say we are launching this oncology product in Kenya, because that process has shortened the period that it takes to bring that product to market. We also really need to address the element of affordability. Many unmet needs compete for budgets on the African continent, and it requires meaningful and purposeful collaboration between manufacturers and payers to identify innovative and affordable solutions that allow for broader utilisation of these innovative medicines. These payers may be insurance companies, the patients themselves, or governments. I think part of the challenge is that, historically, there’s always been a relationship between the public sector and business. And, one of our firm beliefs as MSD is that we need to work through that to ensure that we get to the point where we partner and work collaboratively for the best outcomes for the patient. And where we’ve seen this happening, it works incredibly well. Let’s take Botswana, which, quite early on, about two or three years ago now, really showed an interest in availing this oncology treatment that I spoke about through the public sector and had proactive engagements with us. And we really worked collaboratively to the point where that product is now available and has been available in the public sector in Botswana for the past two years. It is the only country on the continent that has that product. We’re expanding those conversations to other markets and using Botswana as a yardstick to say it is possible. Let’s find a mechanism and a methodology that works best for your budget, your patients and your healthcare ecosystem. So, I think those are the two glaring things. One, the continent has done a sterling job, especially with the African Medicines Agency regulatory process. And the second is just around finding and broadening the use of innovative access programs to ensure that patients are able to get access to innovative high-tech medicines.

In Nigeria, your company is well known as MSD for mothers. Tell us about the company’s presence in the country and the impact you’ve made so far.

From 2023, MSD, through our partnerships with UNICEF and Gavi, played a leading role in the provision of the HPV vaccine across the continent. To date, 14 million Nigerian girls have been vaccinated. In the next five to ten years, when the impact begins to manifest, it really is going to be breathtaking and life-changing. We’ve also got a long-standing medicine donation program called the ‘Mectizan Donation Program’, which has been running for about 30 years now. We provide the Mectizan product for free to low and middle-income countries, Nigeria being one of them. We have committed to doing so until we have eliminated river blindness. And I think it’s a huge impact for communities and people on the continent because this disease is quite debilitating. We’ve also got a division within our business called Social Investments and Sustainability. Within that, we’ve got Merck For Mothers Foundation doing a lot of incredible work and implementing several projects in Nigeria as well as across sub-Saharan Africa just to build more resilient healthcare ecosystems. What I am most excited about is the impact that we’ll have in the future. As I mentioned earlier, we got our registrations a few months ago, which means that we can commercialise our products. And we are starting our process of recruiting personnel. We are finalising a partnership agreement with a commercial partner that will be working with us to have people on the ground to sustainably avail some of these innovations and products to as many people as possible in Nigeria, across West Africa, but also in East Africa. And I certainly think that the impact that that work will have is going to be mind-blowing. We recently received local product registrations, allowing us to commercialise more innovations. We’re currently finalising a partnership with a local commercial distributor, hiring personnel, and investing in infrastructure to ensure sustainable access to our medicines across Nigeria and West Africa.",https://punchng.com/nigeria-now-africas-biggest-hpv-vaccine-market-msd-md/,https://punchng.com
Universities should train students to solve problems — Veteran chartered accountant,"On the occasion of his 85th birthday, veteran chartered accountant and boardroom icon, Chief Olusegun Osunkeye, shares his life’s journey and lessons with BIODUN BUSARI

Can you summarise your life’s journey from cradle to this moment in a few words?

I was born on September 7, 1940. I’m still alive to thank God for His mercy, goodness, and grace over my life for these past 85 years. I have cause to glorify God all my life. I started from very humble beginnings. I’m from Ijemo in Abeokuta, Ogun State. Many Egba, including my father, left Abeokuta after the Adubi War, which lasted from 1914 to 1918. My parents settled in Agege, where I was born.

After the war, those who left Abeokuta went as far as Ebute-Meta to settle. When my elder brother, who was working with the Nigerian Railways, was transferred to Zaria in Kaduna State, he took me, my mother, and my sister along with him. So, I started elementary school at St. George’s African School in Zaria. We travelled by train, and it was a beautiful experience for me.

What was your educational experience like?

I finished my elementary school at St. Paul’s Catholic School, Ebute-Meta. Then, I proceeded to King’s College, Lagos, for my secondary education. I finished there in 1958. I then went to see a certain gentleman named Mr Akintola Williams, the first chartered accountant in Nigeria. I was under his tutelage between 1959 and 1961.

I also went to the Nigerian College of Arts, Science, and Technology in Ibadan. Eventually, I went to England to complete my accountancy studies and returned to the country. I worked with the United Africa Company for five years. I also worked with the West African Portland Cement Company Limited, which is now Lafarge Africa Plc.

I was seconded from UAC to the West African Portland Cement Company Limited. I then resigned to join Nestlé. At Nestlé, I spent 27 years in executive roles, culminating in managing the executive team as the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer from 1988 to 1999. I was the chairman for 14 years, from 1999 to 2013. So, Nestlé has been half of my life.

Would you like to say anything about your family?

Well, I am happily married to my wife. She was a student when we married in London in 1965. So, I’ve been married now for 60 years and still counting. When I speak of the grace, goodness, mercy, and compassion of God, you can see my family life is blessed.

I’m blessed with five children who are doing well to the glory of God in their various chosen professions of banking, law, pharmacy, marketing, accounting, and stockbroking.

Do you have activities that make you feel fulfilled?

When I retired from Nestlé as an executive, I devoted substantial time to voluntary work, which I used to impart what I had learnt in all those years of professional experience to young people. So, I did voluntary work for three years at FATE Foundation.

A few days ago, I still went out to teach and mentor young aspiring entrepreneurs, which is very fulfilling for me. When you see them grow and contribute to the economy of our nation, there is no greater joy. I can say that I have more time to do substantial work in the church, too.

As a devout Christian, how have the tenets of the Orthodox Church where you worship moulded you?

It is a joyful thing to serve the Lord in whatever capacity one finds himself in the house of the Lord. I’ve benefited from serving God. I am also a Rotarian, and I think I’m inspired by the motto of Rotary, which says, ‘One profits most who serves best.’ So, service to God and serving humanity are what I cherish with my life. I serve at the altar of the Most High God. I’m also a Diocesan Layreader who is now preaching evangelism.

I carry out any assignment given to me by the church. I’m very willing to do it because it’s a service to God. Just like when David writes in the Psalms: ‘I was glad when they said unto me: Let us go into the house of the Lord.’ I’m always excited about the things of God in the church.

As a result of your devotion to the church, did you at any time desire to be a priest?

Not really. It didn’t cross my mind that I wanted to be a priest. By the time I was an altar server, I was already a Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer. I was doing very well in my career, and I believed that was what God wanted for me, and to serve Him in the church. But I never considered becoming a priest. My service to God was from my childhood.

I was born in Agege. Our house was close to the church. On Sunday, my parents would take me along to church in Ifako. That was how I started. So, my parents were from the African Church. After that, I have worshipped in prominent orthodox denominations like the African Church, the Anglican, the Catholic, and the Baptist. I’m a Christian by faith, and an Anglican by choice.

Was your educational life smooth?

The answer is yes. Generally, it was smooth in the sense that my duty was to read my books under the guidance of my brother and my mother. From that aspect, they were paying, but I didn’t know anything; I knew they were struggling. My brother, whom I lived with in Zaria, was a third-class clerk.

They made the sacrifice for me, for which I’m still very grateful to them. Even when I was at King’s College, you may say the fee at that time was not much; at any time, it was not easy to pay, but I had people paying for me.

Was there any time you benefited from Chief Obafemi Awolowo’s free education in the old Western Region?

No, I did not. Awolowo’s free education in the Western Region was for elementary school. I entered King’s College in 1954. So, I knew that my brother and my mother made the sacrifice for me to have an education. That was how the school ran smoothly for me.

What was the starting point and sustenance of your robust and fruitful career?

I will say that my Christian faith and upbringing at home were the ingredients of my successful life. We enjoyed a simple life growing up. You might be surprised that in Agege at that time, there was no electricity. Even as late as the 1970s, there was no electricity at Agbara Industrial Estate in Ogun State.

I was working at Nestlé, and we relied on two-base load generators of 1500 kVA each for years. The generators supplied stable, constant power continuously because we maintained the generators, strictly following the manufacturer’s operating manual. They were well managed.

We knew when to order their spare parts. They must not work an extra hour outside the required duration of operation. In a nutshell, the values that I grew up with at home, King’s College, and accountancy training under Mr. Akintola Williams were what helped me in my professional life and career.

What do you suggest for the country’s economic growth?

Policies should focus on the real thing. For instance, we have universities of agriculture, and many of the graduates of the universities of agriculture do not practise or go into farming. The management of the universities of agriculture should be able to produce and supply food for their catchment areas, which cover states contiguous to their locations.

The same thing is applicable to other universities, like technology, engineering, and others. When we have institutions that are basically operating to train students who would solve the country’s problems, we will get better. With this analysis, I expect that we should be talking about mechanised farming.

By looking into this, we are also developing technical education because the future is in technical education, entrepreneurship, and vocation. If we have technical schools, and students are properly taught in electrical, nutrition, refrigeration, and plumbing, our country will be better for it. These are the daily needs of people who need the services. A person can study that and make money from it.

How would you encourage the younger generation, which has the majority of people who want to make money without giving credence to virtues?

There is no substitute for hard work. In whatever you do as a young person, you only succeed with hard work. There are challenges at every height, but hard work sustains the champions to reach the top. That is one factor. Then, education is very important. As the future leaders in the country, education is a way to do a lot of things. It makes you think about what you know.

So, if you are not educated, you are severely limited and making it in life may be difficult. After education comes discipline. There must be character, which is integrity, in whatever you do. Also, diligence is a trait that is common to all endeavours.

What do I mean? If I’m an accountant and you’re a journalist, our common trait is diligence. Let me give a simple example. Let’s look at a medical doctor. Maybe it took him 10 years to qualify as a doctor. But he operates on a human being and forgets a tool inside the patient. He has failed because he was not diligent with his assignment.

It doesn’t mean that he is not qualified. The error is because of not doing due diligence. For youths, when they learn and study, and they know what to do, they must be diligent with it. If you’re not diligent, success will be difficult. Life is evolution, not revolution. Evolution is that if a person does all these four things, they will get a good quality of life.

As a commerce titan, what’s your perspective on the current country’s economic situation?

The country is undergoing many reform policies. Generally, reform takes time to feel through. For instance, the tax bills have been signed into law, and I’m interested in the aspect that exempts low-income individuals from taxation. It’s a good initiative and I support it.

However, we should also support the taxation law and practice, with other policy measures that will make life easier for the Nigerian people, especially for the low-income earners. Other policy measures that will benefit the masses in transportation, health care, and agriculture should be examined and implemented.

What is your personal philosophy about life that you are willing to share?

I have many principles and tenets that have guided me over the years. In life, we are all on a moving escalator. Everyone does that. I call it the principle of movement because we all move exponentially.

When you are tempted to be pompous, arrogant, or get carried away because of your possessions, position, or power, wait and look up the escalator; you will find people who are higher, better, bigger, richer, greater, healthier, and finer than you.

This teaches humility. On the other hand, if you are feeling despondent about your seemingly bad or poor situation in any dimension of life, wait and look down the escalator, and you will find people not as fortunate as you. Then wait, count your blessings, and give glory to God.

Then, you must have integrity and protect it – it is a big asset. One more thing, have a mentor and be a mentor. Mentors coach, advise, counsel, and gently admonish to guide you on the right path. You can perch on the shoulders of your mentors to see far and hold their hands for a longer reach. Do thou likewise, be a mentor.",https://punchng.com/universities-should-train-students-to-solve-problems-veteran-chartered-accountant/,https://punchng.com
UK-based creative seeks to drive social change through art,"London, United Kingdom-based creative, Babatunji Akin-Johnson, has said art must move beyond aesthetics to become a medium for survival, resilience, and social transformation.

A statement shared with Sunday Scoop noted that Akin-Johnson has built a career at the intersection of culture, care and creativity.

It added that he currently works with Platform Support Services in London, where he designs programmes that combine emotional support with structured artistic routines for people navigating vulnerable stages of life.

“I believe creativity is a language everyone speaks. When harnessed with care, it becomes a bridge not only between cultures, but also between the challenges we face and the futures we imagine,” he said.

Akin-Johnson’s community development work also stands out. During his national service in Nigeria, he led the Community Development Service Education and Enlightenment programme, where he introduced spoken word, cultural performances, and visual media to deliver health and civic education in rural areas.

Education, he explained, has always been central to his creative philosophy. He also added that his MBA in Healthcare from the University of Hertfordshire, along with certifications in Project Management and Data Analytics, give structure and accountability to his artistic practice, ensuring his projects deliver measurable outcomes in addition to inspiration.

Now preparing for a new phase of global engagement, Akin-Johnson is seeking endorsement under the UK Global Talent Visa (Arts and Culture – Exceptional Promise).

His plans include launching community-based arts initiatives centred on wellness, African identity, and inclusive storytelling, while also collaborating with British institutions to integrate cultural heritage with contemporary practices.

For him, art remains inseparable from community. “Creativity must serve the people,” he added, underscoring his belief that the arts can shape new possibilities for generations to come.",https://punchng.com/uk-based-creative-seeks-to-drive-social-change-through-art/,https://punchng.com
"Drama deepens as Yul, Judy, May Edochie face fresh battles","The ongoing saga involving Nollywood actor Yul Edochie, his second wife, Judy Austin, and estranged wife, May Edochie, has taken another dramatic twist, with fresh battles unfolding on multiple fronts.

Earlier in the week, May launched a legal offensive against her former lawyer, Emeka Ugwuonye, demanding N1bn in damages. Through her new legal team, Graylaw Partners, she accused Ugwuonye and US-based commentator, Yinka Theisen, of cyberbullying, cyberstalking, and false publications.

The letter partly read, “Our client has expressed deep displeasure and grave concern over your incessant public posts. Your conduct has instigated third parties to propagate your disturbing communications, thereby amplifying the damage and causing our client severe and irreparable harm.”

May demanded a full retraction, a public apology, and immediate withdrawal of online posts.

Theisen, however, hit back on Instagram, accusing May of harassment. “You attacked my kids, shared my number. May Yul-Edochie, enough is enough. Leave me alone!” she declared.

Ugwuonye also welcomed the lawsuit, saying it gave him an opportunity to “shed light on the truth.” He has since launched a barrage of Facebook posts, alleging that May lied about her marriage and divorce proceedings. On Friday, he shared screenshots of alleged private chats with May, claiming he offered her premium support during her case but was betrayed.

He branded her a “manipulative and pretentious liar,” threatening to release more evidence. “If you see the chats between us, you will understand how fake May is. At every point in time, we left them to pay whatever they wished. Yul was the breadwinner,” he alleged, adding that May condoned Judy’s presence in Yul’s life for years.

Ugwuonye further claimed that May’s story about Yul threatening her with a gun was false, adding that she initially resisted divorce because she only wanted to relocate overseas. According to him, Yul married May under pressure after impregnating her at 22.

Meanwhile, Yul and Judy’s relationship also appeared to hit turbulence during the week. In a leaked voice note that circulated online, Judy accused Yul of neglecting responsibilities. “This is just the beginning. It’s game on. If you don’t want to do the needful, no problem. I am ready,” she was heard saying.

Yul fired back, asking what “needful” she referred to and warning that he might end their union. “One morning, I will just wake up and tell you that this is the end of this whole rubbish, and everybody will go their separate ways,” he threatened.

Judy, stunned, asked if he was threatening her, but Yul gave no response. The couple, popularly known for their playful videos and public display of affection, now face speculation that cracks are beginning to show in their union.

While some social media users have expressed joy at the possibility of the marriage crashing, others believe Yul and Judy are deliberately fuelling controversy to remain in the spotlight.

With May pursuing a billion-naira claim, Ugwuonye vowing to fight back, and Yul and Judy clashing in leaked recordings, the Edochie family drama shows no sign of slowing down anytime soon.",https://punchng.com/drama-deepens-as-yul-judy-may-edochie-face-fresh-battles/,https://punchng.com
I Wish I Wish: Battle of the Winds confronts societal vices,"The National Arts Theatre, in collaboration with Proud African Roots, recently premiered a stage play, ‘I Wish I Wish: Battle of the Winds’, at Terra Kulture Art Studios, Victoria Island, Lagos. The play explored themes of cultural identity, tradition, and the impact of urbanisation on African youth.

Blending realism, music, dance, drama, and storytelling, the play highlighted the role of the arts in nurturing imagination, confidence, and community. It tells the story of a young girl caught between life in a modern city and her traditional village roots, as she searches for identity and relevance. The young cast brought their characters to life with depth and conviction, earning admiration from the audience.

Speaking at the event, the General Manager and Chief Executive Officer of the National Theatre, Tolu Akerele, praised the dedication of the cast and crew, many of whom were children of different ages. She revealed that the production was achieved in just 19 days, noting that it stemmed from a summer camp initiative designed to train and build children’s theatre.

Akerele said, “I’m so delighted because I see the children and the parents’ feedback on how the children have changed, how they’ve got new skills. This is what it’s about—training for theatre and even skills beyond that as well. It’s about creating new leaders with the right skill set—discipline, teamwork, collaboration.”

Also speaking at the event, Bola Edwards, co-founder and CEO of Proud African Roots and creator of Grandma Wura, emphasised the importance of storytelling. She said, “Back in the days, our forefathers used storytelling to build society and instill values. We lost that along the way. Now, we’re bringing it back into every parent’s and government’s consciousness, because the power of storytelling can never be overestimated. We exist because we are committed to nation building.”

According to the organisers, the summer camp is part of a larger vision to make the National Theatre not just a hub for established artists, but also a training ground for the next generation, ensuring that cultural heritage is preserved and re-imagined with fresh energy.",https://punchng.com/i-wish-i-wish-battle-of-the-winds-confronts-societal-vices/,https://punchng.com
"10 days, 10 deaths: Inside Lagos’ rising cult killings","The wave of cult-related killings and violence sweeping communities across Lagos State has reached a breaking point, demanding urgent collaboration between the police, parents, and community leaders, reports UTHMAN SALAMI

Residents of some communities in Lagos State now live in palpable fear, as a wave of cult-related killings sweeps across the state.

From the busy streets of Lekki and Ebute Meta to the creeks of Ikorodu, from the inner lanes of Mushin to the family compounds of Meiran, there is rarely no news of gory murders, heinous assaults, or violent retaliation. In less than 10 days, at least 10 persons were confirmed brutally killed in cult-related violence.

A teenage boy resident in the Mushin area was among the innocent residents whose lives had been cut short by the latest spate of attacks.

In the past, cultism, as it was commonly understood, occurred mostly inside higher education institutions.

However, recent events and police arrests indicate that the threat is rapidly spreading into the streets, where vendors, barbers, and vulcanisers are joining the deadly cult in large numbers.

Deadly fights that were only seen on varsity and polytechnic campuses have now become regular occurrences in communities that had been relatively peaceful, with killings being openly spiralling into places of worship, football fields, and even family homes.

Severed human limbs have now become prized trophies for these deadly groups, flaunted like the Champions League cup, while human lives are tallied as casually as goals in a football match.

Speedboats, once relied upon by residents to shorten long journeys and manoeuvre Lagos traffic, have now been repurposed as tools for criminal gangs to launch violent attacks on many Lagos communities.

Despite repeated police crackdowns, the menace persists, and while the state police command insists it will not kowtow to pressure, the wave of violence shows no sign of ending or abatement.

Riverbank killings

Three persons were brutally murdered during a masquerader festival that began on Sunday, August 31, in Lagos Island.

Some members of the family involved in the festival, who are also believed to belong to various cult groups in Lagos, hijacked the event and turned it into a supremacy battle.

“We had just finished the festival when a fight broke out among some boys suspected to be cultists. And before we knew it, they had started throwing bottles at one another while also wielding some dangerous weapons.

“Nobody could even wait to calm the situation other than to run for cover,” a resident who did not want to be mentioned because of the sensitivity of the incident, narrated.

Videos of the chaos captured scenes of heavy gunfire as suspected cultists chased one another through Lagos Street.

In one clip, at least five shots rang out, while a mob of no fewer than 10 men was seen brutally assaulting a victim.

The bloodshed did not end there. On Wednesday, September 3, 2025, another tragedy unfolded when five bodies washed up along the Oreta riverbank in Igbogbo, Ikorodu.

While some residents claimed the victims drowned, others told our correspondent that cultists ferried them in speedboats before executing them. What no one disputed was that the killings were deliberate cult-related.

Less than 24 hours earlier, Baiyeku, another Ikorodu community, was rocked by the killing of a young man whose identity residents were reluctant to disclose to The PUNCH during a phone call last Saturday. Suspected cultists cut off his wrists and feet, displaying the severed parts at a shrine in what residents saw as a ritualistic warning.

“This is beyond fighting. This has turned into a war. Only an animal can carry out such killings,” one resident in Ikorodu who pleaded anonymity for fear of attack said last Saturday.

“The boy wasn’t a cultist. We think it’s about land. But whoever did this wanted the whole community to see and tremble,” the resident added.

The Chairman of Igbogbo/Baiyeku LCDA, Hammed Aroyewun, in a statement on Wednesday, September 3, after the killing in Bayeku, disclosed that he rushed to the scene with security operatives.

He said, “Our people deserve to live in peace and without fear. This administration will continue to deploy every necessary resource, in close partnership with security agencies, to guarantee safety and restore lasting peace.”

Residents described the incident as “painful, unacceptable, and a direct affront to peace.” Patrols were immediately ordered, but residents told PUNCH Metro that fear lingers despite police assurance and calls for calm.

On Sunday, there was a report of fresh violence in the Ibeju-Lekki area, where suspected rival cult groups clashed, leaving two people dead.

By Tuesday, two additional bodies were discovered along the LASU-Igando Road in the Iba area of the state.

In Meiran, as reported by PUNCH Metro on July 25, another chapter unfolded. Rahman, a known member of the Aye cult, tried to outrun his rivals but found no sanctuary.

The killer squad of some suspected Eiye cult group in the area, we gathered, pursued him into his family home, dragged him out, and killed him in front of his relatives.

“They didn’t stop there. They injured people inside the house. It was like a war invasion,” the neighbour who did not want to be mentioned because of fear of attack told our correspondent.

The carnage has not spared the innocent. In Mushin, a 12-year-old boy named Wasiu was sent by his mother to buy food late June. He never returned. A stray bullet from a cult shootout pierced his body, ending his life on the street.

The incident sent shockwaves across Mushin. “We are tired. Today, it is Wasiu; tomorrow, it could be any of our children,” a source in the community told our correspondent.

The long-held belief that cult groups spare civilians is fast fading, as recent killings in Lagos State reveal that innocent residents are increasingly becoming targets of these senseless attacks.

In Eti-Osa, an initiation rite in July turned bloody when rival cultists stormed the gathering. 26-year-old Timilehin, an artisan, was shot dead before he could even complete the process of joining.

The police later confirmed that initiation grounds had increasingly become targets of violent rivalries, with attacks staged specifically to send messages of dominance.

No area epitomised the spiral of violence more than Ebute Meta in recent times. One of the incidents includes the killing of a 30-year-old man better known as Keeper. His death set off reprisals that claimed more lives in quick succession.

The immediate past spokesperson for the state police command, Benjamin Hundeyin, had detailed the arrests that followed the killings.

In a statement, he wrote, “Detectives arrested Raphael Ashim, 30; Wasiu Kareem, 33; Sadiq Olabisi, 40; Olamilekan Oluwatosin, 27; Olalekan Olugbodi, 54; and Ibrahim Oladimeji, 22. All of them were involved in cult clashes in Ebute Meta and its environs, which led to the gruesome murder of one Kamoru, alias Keeper.”

Despite the mass arrests, the killings continued. In quick succession, three more men named Agbara, Butcher, and an unnamed plumber were gruesomely murdered in scenes reminiscent of horror films.

Police crackdown

Faced with mounting criticism, the state police command refused to be overwhelmed by the recent killings as it launched an aggressive clampdown.

The police chief, Olohundare Jimoh, in an exclusive telephone interview with PUNCH PANORAMA, confirmed that more than 26 suspects had been arrested in recent operations.

“Recently, I’ve created an Anti-Cultism Squad in every area command. Now, we have created a central one at the command headquarters to deal with cult clashes.

“What you are witnessing now is attack and counterattack. It is important for parents to weigh in on this and compel their children to desist from cultism.”

The command also redeployed Divisional Police Officers in volatile districts such as Lekki, Ajah, Ogombo, and Elemoro and activated the Eko Strike Force, a special intervention unit.

In an earlier official statement on September 2, the command added, “The command calls on residents to cooperate fully with the intervention team to ensure success and maintain safety.”

The entanglement of cult groups with land disputes, street gangs, and even local festivals, observers believe, is fuelling reprisals and trapping communities in an endless cycle of violence.

Shared responsibility

The command told PUNCH PANORAMA that victory over these emerging insurgents can only be secured if community leaders, parents, and religious institutions join forces and work closely with the police.

“Nowadays, it is not idleness or joblessness that forces people into cultism. These days, you will even see artisans and others engage in cultism.

“Parents must know where their children are and encourage them to denounce cultism,” Jimoh said.

To curb the relentless killings and rising street attacks across Lagos, community leaders, residents, and traditional rulers must close ranks with the police to unmask these murderous groups hiding under the cloak of cultism—before they turn every doorstep in the state into a graveyard.",https://punchng.com/10-days-10-deaths-inside-lagos-rising-cult-killings/,https://punchng.com
"Multinationals crushing Nigerian SMEs, government must protect us – Kuteyi, food processors’ president","In this interview with WALE AKINSELURE, President of the Association of Food and Agro Processors, Duro Kuteyi, analyses the challenges facing Nigeria’s food and agro-processing sector, including unavailability of foreign exchange, high-interest loans, and policy inconsistencies that have pushed many small-scale processors to the brink

How has food and agro-processing in Nigeria been in recent years?

Initially, the situation was chaotic. Towards the end of the last administration, being a member of the Association of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises and president of Food and Agro Processors, I heard a lot of complaints from other members. We found out that it was difficult to get foreign exchange to import machinery. Due to that, most of us could not take a bank loan. This is because if you are taking a bank loan and you cannot turn it into foreign exchange, the bank will charge you interest, and the rate is terrible. By the time this administration came in, the rate went up; raw materials were very scarce and expensive; and the security situation was also terrible, especially for us who depend on agricultural produce to process into food. The situation in the zones where these crops are grown is that you see cows eating up maize, eating up cassava, eating up all sorts of things, some people carrying guns to threaten the farmers and most of the time they kill the farmers. So the situation was terrible. But, of late, things are getting better, like the prices of raw materials are coming down. The price is now better; probably the imported one is forcing the local one to come down, because most of these things are artificial in terms of the way people increase prices. For example, maize was sold for about N1m per ton, and we can get the same maize for N300,000 per ton- you can see the difference. And what business are we doing if we don’t take into consideration those who will buy, those who will eat? Sorghum was sold for about N950,000 per ton. And the same sorghum we can get for N250,000 per ton now. And the land remains the land. Cocoa sold for approximately N16 million per ton. Cocoa butter was sold for N45m per ton. So, we are actually suffering in terms of getting raw material for our product. So it has been like that. However, the Cocoa situation is still not satisfactory for local processors. For example, there is the chain from the farm to the bigger processors that get the raw material from the farm or from aggregators, and from there to process it into powder, cake, and butter. When it’s like that, then you now wonder how much we are getting these things. There are bigger processors, there are bigger manufacturers. At the same time, you have small and medium industries processing and using Cocoa for one thing or the other, whether making cakes, making bread, or making beverages. So, at times, you will find imported Cocoa powder, cocoa cake and butter cheaper than what we are buying locally. In that case, it becomes difficult to export because you use Cocoa at a higher price here, and you want to export to where it’s cheaper, which becomes something difficult.

When did prices start dropping?

We started experiencing a drop in the price of grains last year. The government lifted the ban on the import of grains, and prices started dropping. That’s why we are still able to produce. If not, all of us will have to pack up, because there are limits to the increase in price that the consumer can bear.

Since you say that some prices have come down, Nigerians will still want the prices of items to come further down. What policies must be put in place? What must be sustained for the prices to continue to come down?

The government has taken the lead in importing farm machinery. When you use hand, hoes and cutlasses to make the ground and plant, it’s different from when you are using tractors. And when you use cutlass and hoes, there are limits to what you can do. If you go to some of the villages, labourers are not as cheap as before -even to see is a problem. So the way to do this thing is to get the youth and make them the owners. For example, you have farms, farmland, you clear it, allocate it to the youth, give them tractors that they can be trained on and let them farm on their own, let them earn profits, then a lot of the youth will move into the farm and produce the crops, the food that we can process. There is also a division of labour. I went into farming, and I lost. I decided not to try it again because I was not trained as a farmer. I was trained as a food processor, so I stand within my own lane. So that those who grow, we buy from them and process and give to the others. But some of their products are intermediate products. What is our finished product is raw material to other companies.

You mentioned an artificial increase in prices? Are we a problem to ourselves?

It’s like you increase the price in anticipation of what you are going to buy. For example, you sell yams, and you want to go and buy pepper and other materials. Then you envisage that one so that you will have money to buy other things. Also, when the market people hear that there is an increase in salary or a minimum wage increase, they try to put up their own prices. And when the cost of transportation goes up, because of bad roads, high cost of fuel, they too will also want to balance the situation. It’s like you buy a tomato from the North, by the time it gets to Lagos, more than 50 per cent is damaged. And you still want to make profits, which means that you increase. Whereas, if a tomato had been processed in Kano and brought to Lagos, it would be cheaper than the raw material you are selling in Lagos. There is something called proximate processing. At the point of proximate processing, you process close to the source of raw material so that post-harvest losses will be reduced.

What do you make of the recently introduced four per cent Free On Board charge by the Nigeria Customs Service?

We need to ask the government: “What are they compensating us with to be able to survive if we have to pay four per cent FOB on import of machinery and raw material? As it is, we want our industrialists to survive; at the same time, we open our industry to foreign investors. When the foreign investors come, they come to the export-free zone, where they produce and still flood the Nigerian market. Then you now ask the government, how are you protecting your SMEs and SMEs’ products? If this is not done, SME will always rise and die. In Nigeria, as it is, the multinationals are crushing the SMEs because of a lack of protection for them. If I produce now, the foreign person or the multinational will want to see what we use, how they can produce massively to counter us, and bring the price down in a way that we will not be able to survive. Before India could grow, it protected their SME and SME products. That’s what all Southeast Asia did to grow their own economy. If Nigeria wants to grow industrially, that’s the way to go.

As president of the Association of Food and Agro Processors, what are the most pertinent concerns of your members about doing business in Nigeria?

The government should ensure security for the farmers. Government should, at the same time, protect the MSMEs and their products. The government should see how MSMEs can bring in machinery at no duty. If you allow the tractor to come in at no-duty, that is good; It’s good for everybody. Then the manufacturers, the agro-processors, who are processing what is produced on the farm, whereby tractors are used, also need to enjoy free duty for their equipment so that they will stand at a point where they will reduce post-harvest losses, because without processing, a lot of crops will be wasted. And, with the processing, food security can be guaranteed. When you talk of food security and you are not talking of processing, it’s a waste of time. For example, if I buy a yam and I keep it, how long will it last? But if it’s processed, it can last for two years. Look at cassava, garri can last for three years. With that, the price will not go up. It will remain uniform throughout the year because it’s available throughout the year -not that it’s available this month; next month, it’s not available.

What is our problem in the South-West? Why can’t we produce and feed ourselves? Why do we have to rely on the North?

Our problem in the Southwest is our governance. Take, for example, our road network. Ibadan to Ife is a write-off; there are also no good roads from Ife to Ilesha, to Akure, to Ado-Ekiti. And, when you don’t have good roads, how do you transport? And the governors keep quiet. What does it take for the governors to come together, invite the minister for works to go on that road, not by helicopter, for him to see that there are no good roads in the South-West?

The second issue is the farms. How well have they opened up the farms for the youth? How many tractors have they bought? The governor of Niger State, Mohammed Bago, bought a lot of tractors for farmers to use. How many tractors were purchased in the Southwest by any governor? The yams in Ekiti, Akure, are brought from the Middle Belt. What do we grow in the Southwest that we sell to the North? We are talking of industries. How many industries do you have in Ondo? There is something we call one village, one product or starting with one local government, one industry. The industry will be based on the raw material available in that state. If they can accomplish that one, then they will go to one village, one factory. So you can now see the number of people who will be gainfully engaged. How many local government areas do we have in Ondo, Ekiti, and Osun? Then you look at the array of products that can come out of these places. And the governor should be the chief marketing officer of those products of those industries. He leads, and the Commissioner for Commerce will follow, and we, the SME, will follow. That’s the way to do business. It’s like you have a governor going to other states with his team, and the entrepreneurs follow him to expose what they have. From there, they will get distributors in other states, and then the exchange of goods and exchange of money will happen.

We have the DAWN Commission, the South West Development Commission, and Oodua Investment. Are they the ones expected to coordinate the governors to key into the idea you have spoken about?

They have a role, but if they recommend and the governors are not following. What do they do? The governors themselves need to be educated about this. So the governor can now engage the DAWN Commission or Oodua Investment on what it wants to do. I have heard talks about an industrial park – they call it an agro-industrial park – which is initiated by the African Development Bank, together with the federal government and state government. It’s a good idea for foreign investors, but not for people like us.

What stops people like you from taking your machinery or goods to the said parks?

I went to one and I had to buy land there for 90-95 dollars per square meter. How many Nigerians, how many SMEs can afford that? The way out for us is to create our own industrial park for nano, small, and medium industries. With that, it will boost the economy and the grassroots.

Will having functional silos help stabilise prices?

Silos are relevant for keeping grains. Can you put yams inside silos? Can you put cassava inside silos? Can you put fruit inside silos? All these are possible if the refrigeration, which will depend on electricity, is available. But if processed, you don’t need refrigeration, you don’t need electricity. It’s just good storage. For example, we train people on how to process tomatoes in a way that they will remain like that for two years.

How do you relate the assertion that “government has no business in business” to your call regarding processing and storage in Nigeria?

The government that says government has no business in business is lazy, as there’s nothing wrong with government collaborating with the private sector to establish industry. Till today, in China, there are still government companies. For example, in making cars, there are big companies that make the parts; for machinery, there are big companies that make the parts. And, if you see machinery from China, they look alike because they have the big ones making the parts; the smaller ones take the parts, assemble them and put their names on it. So, these are the things that the Nigerian government should learn from, not simply asking MSMEs to do this and that. The government needs to assist the MSMEs to grow. What a serious state can do is collaborate with MSMEs. Let them operate, and then sell your shares.

How can a situation where imported goods are cheaper than locally-made goods be reversed?

Imported products are cheaper because electricity is likely cheaper there, and raw materials are likely cheaper there. And by the time they put the thing together, it’s like government subsidising electricity, subsidising this and that, and making the operation easier for their manufacturers. A lot of countries subsidise their people to export. For example, transporting from Nigeria to Ghana is not easy; transporting to Liberia is not easy. We don’t have an ocean liner between Nigeria, Ghana, and the West Coast. So, things will be expensive. For example, sending something to Liberia by sea, it will likely go to the UK before coming back to Liberia. Some products are brought in with raw materials that are cheaper than the actual raw materials that are supposed to be there. For example, let’s look at chocolate. Go to the supermarket, and you will see chocolate sold at low prices. Check very well, it is compound chocolate – this means cocoa butter is not there. Standard chocolate will have cocoa butter, cocoa powder and other things. Where you cut corners is when things that are expensive, you find a solution to it. Look at tomato paste. If you are told that what you have there is 100 per cent tomato, you should run. They bring tomato concentrate from abroad, they add water to dilute it, then you need to add red colour to it to retain its reddish colour. And adding water has reduced the total solids in the tomato; they add sugar, then they add CMC, which is a chemical. If you add a small amount of water to the CMC, it will swell up so that it will trap the water that you are adding to it. Then they put starch, and now add preservative. So the quantity of tomato is very small, and people believe they are eating a tomato. How will it not be cheaper than the actual tomato? You also know that this administration has not actually opened borders except for the grains. Having expensive grains has taken eggs away from your table. Not having grains at affordable prices has closed so many poultry farms. The cost of feed has made it not profitable for them, and households that are not well-off cannot buy eggs. And the cost of feed for other livestock is affecting the intake of protein by Nigerians. Only those who can afford it are eating eggs. Others are getting malnourished by the day. Our nutritional level as Nigerians is very low.",https://punchng.com/multinationals-crushing-nigerian-smes-government-must-protect-us-kuteyi-food-processors-president/,https://punchng.com
Super Eagles Face Crucial World Cup Qualifier Against South,"Once again, the Super Eagles find themselves on the edge of missing football’s grandest stage — the FIFA World Cup — after another inconsistent qualification campaign. With a decisive showdown in Bloemfontein just hours away, Nigeria’s hopes of booking a ticket to the 2026 Mundial hang by the thinnest of threads, Pedro Peter writes

On Tuesday (today), Nigeria’s faltering bid to reach the 2026 FIFA World Cup — to be hosted in the United States, Canada, and Mexico — hits a crucial juncture. Standing in their way are eternal rivals, South Africa’s Bafana Bafana, a formidable opponent determined to block Nigeria’s dream of appearing at a seventh World Cup finals.

The journey, which began in November 2023, has been nothing short of turbulent. The three-time African champions have shuffled through three different managers — José Peseiro, Finidi George, and now Eric Chelle — but consistency has remained elusive. Securing the sole ticket from Group C has proven a daunting task, made worse by underwhelming results and off-field missteps.

When the draw placed Nigeria alongside regional rivals Benin Republic, Rwanda, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, and South Africa, optimism was high. With a frontline boasting Victor Osimhen, Ademola Lookman, and other European-based stars, few imagined qualification would become a desperate struggle. Yet, reality has been sobering: just 10 points from seven matches, with a record of two wins, four draws, and one loss, leaving Nigeria third in the group.

Campaign doomed from start

Much of Nigeria’s troubles can be traced to February 2024, when the Super Eagles surprisingly reached the AFCON final in Ivory Coast under Peseiro. Despite that unexpected run, it was evident that the squad required tactical renewal and fresh ideas. The Nigeria Football Federation’s hesitation over Peseiro’s contract created instability, and when he eventually stayed on, the team stumbled out of the gate.

A drab 1-1 draw with Lesotho in Uyo was followed by another uninspired 1-1 stalemate against Zimbabwe, results that sealed Peseiro’s fate. Yet the federation dragged its feet again, appointing Finidi George late in the cycle.

Hailed after guiding Enyimba to a league title, Finidi quickly found the heat too much. His tenure opened with a 1-1 draw against South Africa on June 7, 2024, before disaster struck three days later in a 2-1 loss to Benin Republic, coached by none other than former Nigeria boss Gernot Rohr. The fallout with Osimhen only worsened matters, forcing Finidi’s premature exit.

Eric Chelle was eventually drafted in, bringing brief respite. A 2-0 win over Rwanda in March 2025 offered hope, only for a wasteful 1-1 draw at home to Lesotho to renew fears of a World Cup absence. Chelle’s pragmatic style has yielded results, but his team has looked disjointed, relying more on grit than fluid play.

Date with old foes

The situation is dire. Failure to qualify would mean back-to-back absences from the World Cup — an unprecedented stain on Nigeria’s footballing heritage. Meanwhile, South Africa has surged with a four-match winning run, strengthening their grip on Group C.

Yet history offers a glimmer of hope: the Super Eagles have never lost a competitive game in South Africa, a psychological edge some fans and pundits cling to.

Former Eagles forward and manager, Emmanuel Amuneke, was, however, critical of the side, “The other teams also have their ambitions and will not sit back for the Eagles to control the game. While we wish them the best of luck, it is going to be very tough for the Super Eagles. This is a time when we have to be realistic. There is a very slim chance and they would have to play much better than what we have seen so far.”

Media personality and football pundit, Charles Anazodo, told The PUNCH, “I think it’s ideal to place blame where blame needs to be placed. And I think it’s the fault of the football federation that we are where we are as we speak because no matter what anybody says, Gernot Rohr was on a path. And he qualified us for every major tournament with games to spare. The football federation, for whatever reason, sacked Rohr. You replaced him with Peseiro. He gets us into the final of the Africa Cup of Nations and for whatever reason, Peseiro does not renew his contract. Until tomorrow, we do not know why.

“But as far as news filtering is concerned, the man was not happy with the way he was treated by the football federation and Nigerians in general. You know, so that’s another story, and like I said, I blame the football federation. Now we’re in this precarious situation with the Bafana Bafana. But as much as everybody seems to think it’s all doom and gloom, I might slightly differ because if statistics are anything to go by, we know that history plays a huge part in football. After all, it does affect your mentality and your psyche.”

He added, “The Super Eagles have played 13 competitive games against Bafana Bafana. And in those 13, the Eagles have never lost in South Africa. And I really don’t see how that is going to happen on Tuesday. The worst that I envisage is the Super Eagles getting a draw against Bafana. On paper, they might seem like a better team in terms of their coordination, their arrangement, administration, everything. Plus, they have a very experienced coach in Hugo Broos.”

“Yes, we are under pressure as well as Nigeria because we want to be at the World Cup. We can’t afford not to go to the FIFA World Cup back-to-back,” Anazodo concluded.

Olympic gold medallist, Abiodun Obafemi, warned, “You know how passionate Nigerians are when it comes to our national team. When they don’t perform well, we should expect a backlash. Anything short of a win, then we are in trouble.”

“Other teams also have ambitions. It will be very tough for the Super Eagles. We must be realistic — the chances are slim, and they will need to play far better than we’ve seen.”

Fan opinion remains divided.

Ayoola Oyelami admitted, “I’m about 60 per cent confident, but not fully convinced by what I’ve seen.”

Bayo Otu, another football fan, noted injuries as a key concern.

“Without Osimhen, it’s tough. But it’s a chance for players like Arokodare and Dessers to prove themselves. A draw seems the safest bet.”

Meanwhile, another fan, Elijah, struck an optimistic note, “I believe we’ll win. Some of our senior players haven’t been to the World Cup, and this is their chance. Even without Osimhen, we can beat South Africa on their own turf.”

Crunch time in Bloemfontein

For all the analysis, debates, and permutations, the reality is simple: the Super Eagles must deliver today. A win in Bloemfontein could turn despair into hope, but anything less might doom Nigeria to another painful absence on the world stage.

Whatever the outcome, one fact remains: Nigeria’s qualification campaign has fallen far below expectations. For a nation steeped in footballing heritage, the road to North America 2026 has been chaotic, wasteful, and, above all, avoidable.",https://punchng.com/can-eagles-fly-high-in-bloemfontein/,https://punchng.com
How lack of sign interpreters sends Borno’s deaf patients to early graves,"ISAH OJO, in this report, writes on how the absence of sign language interpreters in Borno State Government and private medical facilities complicates health issues, killing patients, including pregnant women with ear and speech impairment

Nigeria’s healthcare sector grapples with various challenges, including poor infrastructure, inadequate funding, brain drain, and a struggling insurance system. While these challenges are general and noticeable across the country, Borno State is facing a peculiar problem in its health sector. Silently, this peculiar challenge is claiming the lives of citizens of Borno State.

On May 2, 2025, a pregnant woman, Kyellu Hassan, who was suffering from speech and ear impairment, died during childbirth at Muhammad Shuwa Memorial Hospital. While childbearing comes with its own dangers, Hassan’s inability to communicate effectively with nurses compounded the risks associated with bringing forth a child into the world. According to the chairman of the Borno state Deaf Association, Adamu Bukar, Hassan was one of several deaf women who have died due to the inability to effectively communicate during labour. “Many of our women died due to a communication gap while giving birth. Just like Kyellu Hassan, who died on the 2nd of May, 2025, at Muhammed Shuwa Memorial Hospital, there have been many such cases in the past,” Bukar said.

Bukar also mentioned the case of Maryam Musa, with similar hearing impairment, who also died because medical practitioners failed to effectively decode the message being passed across by their patients. “Let me also add that in 2023 precisely, one of our members, Maryam Musa, died at the Specialist hospital, Maiduguri, because no one could communicate effectively with her using the official languages. It will interest you to know that these victims understand how to communicate with signs, but were left to their fate when there was no one to efficiently interpret how they said they felt.”

Evidence abounds of a disconnect between medical practitioners and ears and speech impairments in public and private medical facilities across the state capital, Maiduguri and surrounding local government areas. The top hierarchy of the deaf association notes that the absence of sign language interpreters at medical facilities often results in misdiagnosis, and in some cases, death, as patients struggle to communicate their feelings, needs and symptoms to healthcare providers. The issue ranges from inefficient to total breakdown in communication in healthcare facilities. Health researchers identify effective communication as being of the utmost importance when delivering healthcare. Without it, they note that the quality of healthcare would be impaired, healthcare costs and negative patient outcomes would increase. They note that components of effective communication in a healthcare setting crisscross healthcare literacy, cultural competency and language barriers. Effective communication, they note, is bidirectional between patients and healthcare systems. If either the patient or health care provider lacks a clear understanding of the information conveyed, the delivery of care is compromised.

People with impairment face peculiar challenges accessing healthcare in Nigeria, including inaccessible infrastructure, inadequate funding, and a severe shortage of specialised medical staff and training. There are also issues of stigma, discrimination, and societal misconceptions that lead to exclusion from services and information. Experts also note that people with one form of impairment or the other face barriers, including a lack of assistive devices, inaccessible transportation, limited availability of information in accessible formats, and the absence of dedicated units for special needs.

Clearly, the absence of many professional interpreters in Nigeria is a gap that limits individuals with such disabilities from accessing healthcare and surviving in a society that already puts them at a disadvantage.

Umar Garba, an ear and speech-impaired person, who communicated with The PUNCH via written text, lamented the challenges of relying on writing to engage medical professionals in the hospitals.

Garba said, “Whenever I go to the hospital, I engage doctors through writing, since I can write to some extent. This has always helped to at least communicate my feelings. However, it is not enough because certain things are just beyond written expression to say. You just need someone (interpreter) who understands your language.”

Another ear and speech-impaired person, who is also the zonal coordinator of the community, Nafiu Muhammad, explained that those with writing skills among the impaired persons are the lucky few, while others often rely on relatives to convey their feelings to medical practitioners.

“Many of us write our complaints when we go to the hospital. However, for those who cannot write, their families often serve as an alternative option since they are believed to know them better,” Muhammad said.

For those without good writing skills and without relatives by their side, the situation is often such that they interact with healthcare workers using body gestures. They are therefore left at the mercy of the healthcare worker to only guess their pain.

Despite not being professionals, relatives of persons with such disabilities, over the years, have filled the gap, serving as mediators between the patients and healthcare workers. Medical experts even argue that this contradicts the ethical standards of the medical profession of privacy and confidentiality. However, this has proven to be the available solution for those who lack writing skills. There is also the question of whether the right translation of the patient’s complaints is being given to the medical personnel.

Aisha Sani, whose daughter, Fati, has speech and hearing impairment, said she takes up the task of communicating the health needs of her daughter to medical practitioners.

“If I did not help my daughter, who would?” Sani asked.

She adds, “My daughter is 10 years old. She is not yet able to write correctly. As a result of this, I have to always be there to communicate on her behalf during any medical need.”

She added that, over time, she understands her daughter easily. “We have been together from birth, so I can easily guess how she feels. However, nothing beats having professionals to interact with or complement the communication,” she added.

Some healthcare professionals in the state, in interactions with The PUNCH, explained how they managed to communicate with persons with disabilities in the absence of interpreters in hospitals. The Medical Director of Borno state-owned Dental Hospital, Maiduguri, Dr Bukar Gana, recounted incidents where the hospital has had to invite unofficial persons to assist the hospital during times of such needs.

He said, “With regards to our patients with disability, most especially for those of speech and hearing, there has never been a time when we have officially engaged interpreters. In fact, we have not had that even in the state civil service. Our hospitals don’t have an interpreting specialist attached to us.

“Those days, we were lucky to have a staff whose father could interpret. Whenever we have such patients, we call him to interpret for us. The painful thing currently is that even that person is no longer with us.”

Commenting on the possible inaccuracy of information provided by relatives or by the patients, the MD said, “Even for the writing, in this part of the country, most of such patients that come here can’t even write, so what we mostly see is that they will be accompanied by their children or relations that can interpret for them.

“But if you look at it critically, even their relations are just doing guesswork, because they are not professionals and they lack knowledge of the communication terminologies.”

He pointed out, “If we can get such a specialist, it will greatly save our time and help in doing the right thing for those in need of these special services.”

A Dentist in the state, Dr. Enne Abba, said the situation is more critical, especially when dealing with children. “It will be a very wonderful initiative that our hospitals have sign interpreters to ease the stress on doctors who will spend more time understanding patients through their body gestures.”

“The situation is even more worrisome when dealing with children with such cases. Understanding them used to be very difficult because of their inability to express themselves. So if the government can consider this, I see it as a very good development,” she added.

The Chairman of the Borno State Deaf Association, Adamu Bukar, urges the government to engage the disability community and employ from among them to serve its members in public and private hospitals in the state and country at large.

“We need professional sign language interpreters at designated hospitals across the 27 local government areas of Borno state”, he said.",https://punchng.com/how-lack-of-sign-interpreters-sends-bornos-deaf-patients-to-early-graves/,https://punchng.com
Larry Ellison: Oracle founder who dethroned Musk as world’s richest man,"Tech billionaire Larry Ellison has displaced Elon Musk as the world’s richest person after shares of Oracle, the company he co-founded nearly five decades ago, surged on the back of soaring demand from artificial intelligence firms.

PUNCH Online reports that Ellison’s fortune climbed to $393bn on Wednesday, overtaking Musk’s $385bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The boost came after Oracle reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results and projected more growth in its cloud business, which now powers AI giants such as ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.

Oracle made its name building databases that allow big organisations to securely store and manage massive amounts of information.

In recent years, however, the company has shifted its focus to cloud computing, running huge data centres that rent out computing power, storage, and networking to other businesses.

This move has paid off in the age of artificial intelligence, where companies such as OpenAI need enormous processing power to train and run their models.

Instead of building their own data centres, many of these AI firms rely on Oracle’s infrastructure, and the surge in demand for this service has driven Oracle’s shares sharply higher.

Ellison co-founded Oracle in 1977 alongside Bob Miner and Ed Oates. It was originally called Software Development Laboratories,

Their early contract with the CIA led to the creation of “Oracle,” a database program that launched the company into prominence.

By 1987, Oracle had become the world’s largest database management firm and later expanded through high-profile acquisitions such as PeopleSoft, Sun Microsystems, and NetSuite.

Ellison, now 81, has served in multiple leadership roles, including nearly four decades as Oracle CEO before stepping aside in 2014 to become executive chairman and chief technology officer.

Under his guidance, the company shifted aggressively into cloud computing and AI infrastructure.

Its $500bn “Stargate” initiative, unveiled this year, aims to build massive data centres tailored for artificial intelligence.

Beyond business, Ellison owns 98% of Lanai, Hawaii’s sixth-largest island.

He has also poured millions into sailing, backing Oracle Team USA’s America’s Cup triumph and co-founding the SailGP league. He is also known for revitalising the Indian Wells tennis tournament in California.

His political donations, often favouring Republicans, have kept him close to Washington, where he has recently appeared alongside AI and tech leaders in policy discussions.

Ellison has also expanded into media, acquiring nearly half of Paramount Skydance in 2025, a $28bn entertainment powerhouse led by his son David.

His daughter, Megan, is a celebrated Hollywood producer behind films such as Zero Dark Thirty and American Hustle. David produced blockbusters like The Terminator and Mission: Impossible.

While Tesla’s stock has stumbled this year, dragging Musk down the rankings, Oracle’s transformation into an AI cloud giant has pushed Ellison to the top for the first time in his long career.",https://punchng.com/larry-ellison-oracle-founder-who-dethroned-musk-as-worlds-richest-man/,https://punchng.com

Oracle shares surged more than 35 per cent in early trading on Wednesday after the software giant projected massive revenue growth based on contracts tied to artificial intelligence.

Oracle CEO Safra Catz called the just-finished quarter “astonishing” as the company signed “four multi-billion-dollar contracts with three different customers.”

About 40 minutes into trading, shares were at $337.02, up nearly 40 per cent, lifting the company’s market valuation to around $950 billion.

The surge will significantly boost the wealth of Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, who could potentially surpass Elon Musk as the world’s richest person.

Oracle’s rally also lifted the S&P 500, which rose 0.5 per cent to 6,545.94, pushing the index further into record territory.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 per cent to 45,659.71, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.3 per cent to 21,950.81.

All three indices finished at records Tuesday as markets anticipate a likely Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week amid signs of a weakening US employment market.

Those expectations were reinforced by a surprise 0.1 per cent decline in the producer price index in August, according to government data. US consumer price data for the same period will be released Thursday.

AI-related investments have been a major driver of equity market strength in 2025.

Oracle projected that its cloud business revenues would grow 77 per cent in the current fiscal year to $18 billion. In subsequent years, revenues are expected to rise to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion.

Catz said the company expects to sign “additional multi-billion-dollar” contracts in the coming months.

African govts advised to harness AI for inclusive growth,"African governments have been urged to prioritise artificial intelligence as a strategic driver of inclusive economic growth, with a warning that the continent risks being left behind if policymakers fail to foster innovation-friendly environments.

In a statement to The PUNCH, an information analyst, Nathaniel Akande, said AI was no longer a futuristic concept but a tangible force already reshaping industries across Africa.

He noted that e-commerce platforms were deploying AI to optimise search results, manage delivery routes, and detect fake reviews, while education technology start-ups were using AI tutors that adapt to the learning pace of pupils, particularly in underserved regions.

He explained that the agricultural sector was now harnessing AI-driven weather models to guide planting and harvesting decisions, and healthcare innovators were relying on AI-powered apps to detect early signs of diseases such as diabetes and breast cancer. In the financial services industry, digital banks and wallets were using AI to enhance loan scoring, prevent fraud, and provide chat-based financial advice.

“These are not theoretical projections, but realities unfolding in our time,” Akande said. “The challenge lies in scaling these innovations sustainably and ethically.”

Akande projected that Africa’s digital economy could surpass $180bn by the end of 2025, with platforms and data-driven services leading the way. He stressed that enterprises which embed AI into their operations would be better placed to navigate complexity, serve customers more effectively, and compete globally.

He also underscored the importance of supportive government policy, urging regulators to strike a balance between encouraging innovation and safeguarding consumers.

“Governments and policymakers must create a regulatory framework that promotes responsible AI adoption, protects citizens’ rights, and incentivises investment in AI. This is the surest way to build smart enterprises that can contribute meaningfully to national development,” he said.

According to him, AI is now a necessity rather than an option for African businesses, regardless of whether they are start-ups addressing local challenges or platforms scaling across borders.

“Enterprises that integrate AI into their strategies will not only secure market share but also help shape the continent’s digital architecture,” he added.

Mr. Akande, who holds an MBA and an MSc in Cybersecurity, is a Certified ISO 27001 Lead Implementer with more than eight years of experience in threat intelligence, incident response, vulnerability management, and governance, risk and compliance. He has worked on enterprise projects in data governance and AI risk management and is recognised for his expertise in aligning operations with international standards such as GDPR, ISO 27001 and NIST.",https://punchng.com/african-govts-advised-to-harness-ai-for-inclusive-growth/,https://punchng.com
Aurora Tech Award unveils bootcamp for women-led startups,"The Aurora Tech Award, in partnership with The Nest Innovation Technology Park, has announced the launch of the Foundry for HER Bootcamp, a three-day, high-impact virtual accelerator designed exclusively for early-stage women-led tech startups in Nigeria.

Scheduled to run from October 15 to 17, 2025, the bootcamp aims to equip 120 female founders with practical tools, mentorship and investor readiness to scale their businesses and position them for the global Aurora Tech Award Open Call 2026. Applications opened on September 8 and will close on October 3, 2025.

According to the organisers, the fully online programme will deliver sessions in key areas such as pitching, fundraising, and scaling beyond local markets, with guidance from leading ecosystem figures and investors.

Head of the Aurora Tech Award, Isabella Ghassemi-Smith, said the initiative reflects the organisation’s commitment to strengthening women-led enterprises in Africa’s largest startup hub.

Ways to reduce screen time for healthy vision,"Reducing screen time is important for maintaining healthy vision and preventing digital eye strain, also known as computer vision syndrome.

Screens have become a constant part of daily life in today’s digital world, from work and education to entertainment and communication.

While technology offers convenience and connectivity, excessive screen time poses serious risks to eye health with outcomes like blurred vision, dry eyes, and long-term vision problems.

According to a 2022 survey by the American Optometric Association, the average gamer spends more than eight hours a day on screens and has experienced various eye-related symptoms from gaming, including eyestrain, headaches, dry eyes, and blurred vision.

The body noted that many gamers are aware of the eye health implications of long-term screen usage, but less than half, 46 per cent, visit an eye care professional for a comprehensive eye examination every year.

Defining digital eye strain as a complex eye and vision problem related to near work experienced during or due to computer use, the AOA stated, “Using technology has many benefits, but it should be used responsibly.

“With gaming and screen time on the rise, so is the risk of screen-related eye issues. The sooner you start prioritising your eye health offline, the longer you can continue doing what you love online.”

The Chief Medical Director, Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife, Osun State, Prof John Okeniyi, said that excessive screen time leads to eye strain and blurred vision.

Okeniyi, who is also a Consultant Paediatrician, said digital eye strain is also becoming increasingly common in children due to excessive screen exposure.

He also warned that excessive screen time is posing serious health risks to children, including delays in cognitive and motor development, obesity, vision problems, and mental health issues.

According to an online medical portal, Mayo Clinic, prolonged exposure to screens can lead to fatigue, discomfort, and even difficulty focusing on distant objects.

“As such, it is crucial to adopt healthy habits that reduce screen time and support better vision. Simple lifestyle changes like following the 20-20-20 rule, taking frequent breaks, and setting screen-free zones can make a significant difference.

“For both children and adults, prioritising eye care is essential in a world increasingly dominated by digital devices.

“By taking conscious steps to limit screen exposure, individuals can preserve their vision and reduce the risk of digital eye-related issues. Healthy vision starts with smarter screen habits.”

However, the following are some effective tips to reduce screen time and improve your vision:

Take breaks and follow the 20-20-20 rule

Take eye breaks. Look away from your monitor, smartphones, televisions, and tablets, among other things.

According to Mayo Clinic, the 20-20-20 rule is the game: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.

“The 20-20-20 rule is an effective way of protecting your eyes from digital strain. This gives your eyes a chance to relax and reduce fatigue,” it said.

Check lighting and reduce glare

Mayo Clinic stressed that bright lighting and too much glare can strain the eyes and make it difficult to see objects on a monitor.

“The worst problems are generally from sources above or behind you, including fluorescent lighting and sunlight. Consider turning off some or all of the overhead lights. If you need light for writing or reading, use an adjustable desk lamp.

“Close blinds or shades, and avoid placing your monitor directly in front of a window or white wall. Place an anti-glare cover over the screen,” it added.

Maintain correct screen positioning

Correct screen positioning is essential to reduce eye strain and discomfort. When your screen is at the right height and distance, your eyes don’t have to work as hard to focus, preventing fatigue and potential long-term vision issues.

“Your computer monitor should be at arm’s length, with the top of the screen adjusted to just below eye level. Make sure that your computer monitor is at arm’s length and adjust the height so the top of the screen is just below eye level,” a Las Vegas ophthalmology and LASIK clinic, Brimhall Eye.

Use computer eyeglasses

According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, if you work on a computer for many hours at a time, you might find that using computer eyeglasses reduces eye strain.

“These prescription glasses allow you to focus your eyes specifically at computer screen distance (intermediate distance, which is about 20–26 inches away from your face). Some of these glasses have multifocal lenses to help you quickly shift your focus between close, intermediate, and far distances. Be aware that computer glasses for reducing eye strain are not the same as blue light blocking glasses,” it stated.

Adjust brightness and screen contrast

“If your screen glows brighter than your surroundings, your eyes have to work harder to see. Adjust your screen brightness to match the level of light around you. Also, try increasing the contrast on your screen to reduce eye strain,” the American Academy of Ophthalmology advised.

Engage in offline activities

In this fast-paced digital world, offline leisure activities have emerged as a vital avenue for personal well-being and work-life balance.

They refer to activities that do not require screens or the internet and allow individuals to engage in hobbies, sports, and social interactions offline.

As we spend an increasing amount of time online, reconnecting with the offline world offers a refreshing break, fostering creativity, relaxation, and deeper social connections.

They encourage us to escape the constant buzz of notifications, allowing our minds to recharge and focus on what truly matters.",https://punchng.com/ways-to-reduce-screen-time-for-healthy-vision/,https://punchng.com
How to protect yourself from sexual predators,"From time to time, social media is awash with lurid stories of girls and women across the country that had been sexually harassed or even raped.

WebMD, a popular online resource that provides medical information, defines a sexual predator as “a person who seeks out sexual contact with another person in a predatory or abusive manner.”

It further explains that sexual predators “may or may not have committed sex crimes like sexual harassment, assault, rape, and paedophilia.”

While some of these sexual predators are known to the survivors, others are random attackers in public places.

Some sexual predators attempt to exploit adult victims, while many are child sexual predators who, in some cases, build trust with their victims as a form of grooming.

Last month, the Lagos State Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Tokunbo Wahab, announced that state operatives arrested 71 miscreants across Terminals 1, 2, and 3 of Oshodi for allegedly harassing women.

A report released by the Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency, an arm of the state Ministry of Justice, in August, indicated that there were 93 cases of rape, 138 cases of sexual assault, and 113 cases of sexual assault by penetration from September 2023 to July 2024.

Recently, in Jigawa State, a 32-year-old man, Bashir Umar, allegedly lured an eight-year-old girl into a restroom where he allegedly tortured and sexually assaulted her.

“The world has always been a cruel place for women,” noted a medical professional, Dr Adewumi Adeola.

“However, we can’t roll over and play dead in the face of such assaults on our dignity. There are ways we can try our best to prevent such situations from happening.”

Here are some ways to protect yourself from sexual predators:

Break the silence jinx

Adeola pointed out that sexual predation thrives in silence, when there are no channels of communication that enable proper awareness or alert others.

“Parents need to have open conversations about sexual predation with their children, and individuals should do so with their siblings. Teach your daughters, sons, sisters, and brothers about the parts of their bodies that no one should ever touch.

“Cultivate the type of relationship with your children or siblings that gives them the right vocabulary to speak out when someone is trying to assault them,” she added.

Be sensitive to changes in conversation

A Lagos-based health worker, Mrs Bolanle Waheed, stated that women needed to be alert when the tone of their conversation with a male friend or stranger begins tilting towards harassment.

“The male figure could be your friend, a religious person, or a stranger. Once the conversation starts tilting towards your body or their hands begin crossing certain boundaries, walk away and avoid meeting them in enclosed spaces,” she advised.

Be vigilant

Parents are advised to observe who they allow to play with their children or where they visit.

Adeola noted, “When an adult male jokingly calls your daughter ‘his wife’, as a mother, put your foot down and counter it. Our times call for vigilant parenting for both boys and girls. Always be present with them when they visit your neighbours.

“Be vigilant of visitors who leer at your children, give them unwarranted gifts, or always want to lap them. These are common tactics used by sex predators who are family friends, babysitters, or home helps to molest children.”

Carry a weapon

Women are advised to keep their bags within easy reach to access weapons that could protect them.

“Tasers, pepper spray, and pocket knives are good weapons, particularly if you know how to use them to ward off a potential attacker,” Waheed said.

Inform others of your location

He further advised, “You must always inform people of where you are going. Take photos, make phone calls when you are in an Uber, send out your live location, and avoid meeting someone you’ve only been chatting with on social media in a private place.

“If you are meeting someone for the first time, make the meeting place a public one, and let your loved ones know how to keep track of your movements and know when you need help.”

Opt for self-defence

“Women who drink alcohol or take stimulants at parties are at a high risk of being sexually assaulted. When going out to such places, ensure that your drinks are not spiked and keep your head clear. It’s also not a bad idea to take self-defence classes, as this can help a lot in protecting yourself,” Adeola said.

Advising men, Waheed said, “As a man, when you see a lady in danger of being assaulted, step in and stop it. Don’t be a bystander; call the authorities and raise an alarm to attract attention. Don’t be an accessory to a crime.”",https://punchng.com/how-to-protect-yourself-from-sexual-predators/,https://punchng.com
Food crises: Six tips on how to own a thriving home garden,"The cost of buying fresh fruits and vegetables from the market has skyrocketed, prompting many to consider owning a home garden. However, space is often a significant concern as most city dwellers live in rented apartments.

According to a recent report by an online real estate platform, BuyLetLive, approximately 98.5 per cent of Lagos residents reside in rented accommodations.

Living in rented apartments makes it seemingly difficult to own a home garden because there is barely enough ground space for all residents to park their vehicles, let alone have space for a garden.

That’s where small balconies come in. Owning a home garden in cities doesn’t have to be an elaborate and grand affair; even small spaces like balconies can be utilised for growing plants bonsai-style.

Not only does this provide a ready supply of home-grown fresh vegetables, but it also keeps the mind engaged and active.

Cultivating a home garden on your balcony involves just the space, tiny pots, and seeds.

Wisdom and science play crucial roles in the art of home gardening. Without them, you may end up wasting your time and money, which nobody wants in this economy.

So, here’s some advice from a home gardening expert on how to successfully own a home garden.

Good Quality Seeds

To own a thriving and lush garden, you must use the right seeds, says Uduak Bassey, a home gardener with years of experience growing fruits and vegetables.

Speaking on the choice of seeds, she said, “Choosing the right plants and high-quality seeds is crucial for a thriving garden, as it ensures predictable results and allows you to save seeds for future use. This approach can save you time and money in the long run.

For example, growing strawberries in Lagos may not be successful due to incompatible growing conditions, so opting for native plants that suit your local environment will yield better results.”

Bassey also discourages using seeds from market-bought produce because the quality of their fruits may be sub-par.

Soil Quality

From her experience and extensive research, Bassey advises, “Ensure your soil is rich in nutrients, well-drained, and has the right pH for your plants.

Use compost and organic matter to enhance soil health and fertility. Good quality soil will give you more robust plants.”

Sunlight

She also advises aspiring gardeners to choose a location that will ensure the plants receive adequate sunlight based on their needs, revealing that most vegetables and flowering plants require at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.

Watering

Just as plants need sunlight, they also need water. It’s important to water the garden consistently, keeping the soil moist but not waterlogged. Adjust the watering frequency based on weather conditions and the specific needs of your plants.

Pest Management

“I’m sure you’ve heard the phrase, ‘prevention is better than cure’. It applies to gardening too! Monitor your garden regularly for pests and diseases. Catch the pests early, before they multiply rapidly and spread. Use integrated pest management techniques, including beneficial insects, natural predators, and bio-pesticides to keep pests under control,” she advises.

Mulching

This is the process of covering the topsoil with plant material such as leaves, grass, twigs, crop residues, straw, etc.

“Applying mulch around the plant helps to retain soil moisture, regulate temperature, and suppress weeds,” Bassey says.

She also notes that organic mulches like wood chips, dry leaves, or straws improve soil fertility as they decompose.",https://punchng.com/food-crises-six-tips-on-how-to-own-a-thriving-home-garden/,https://punchng.com
6 ways to handle a child with substance abuse,"Substance abuse among children is a significant concern, with various studies indicating that it often begins from adolescence.

According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which is part of the United States National Institutes of Health, factors influencing drug use in children include peer pressure, mental health issues, and accessibility to substances.

It further noted that early exposure can lead to dependency and long-term health consequences.

Addressing your child’s substance abuse can be one of the most challenging and daunting experiences a parent or caregiver faces.

A recent study conducted by Samuel Bunu, Ronari Charles, Oyintari Charles, and Patricia Okafor on the assessment of teenagers’ involvement in drug and substance abuse in Nigeria showed a rapid increase in the unhealthy use of drugs among teenagers, with more than 66.50 per cent, including both males and females, engaging in the misuse of substances to enhance their physical activities and for other reasons.

To solve this problem, understanding the complexities of addiction and its impact on a young person’s life is crucial for effective intervention. Experts say it is important to approach the situation with empathy, patience, and a willingness to seek help.

Every child’s journey with substance use is unique, and recognising the signs early can significantly improve the chances of recovery.

Here are six ways to handle the situation if your child is struggling with substance abuse.

Sit them down and discuss

According to mental health practitioners, the first step for any parent or guardian is to sit the child down and discuss the adverse implications of substance abuse.

Experts agree that conducting joint research online or using the story of a known substance addict can help the child understand the impacts of substance abuse.

Behaviour analyst, Ibukunola Afolabi, said parents should remain calm during the conversation about substance abuse, noting that such discussions can prevent further crises that might worsen the addiction.

“When a child abusing substances feels heard by the parents, it can help the child reveal secrets that will assist in navigating the recovery process. Many children abusing substances often feel neglected or unheard of by their families, which is why they go along with the crowd.

The first step in handling a child with substance abuse is to sit down as a family and talk about it,” the expert said.

Go for family counselling

After having a heart-to-heart conversation with the child, a psychologist, Idris Abayomi, said parents should also enrol in counselling sessions to understand how to interact positively with the child. He said this would help prevent ill feelings between them and the child.

“To address dysfunctional dynamics, enhance communication, and support the child’s recovery, it is critical for the entire family to set an example and participate in thorough and continuous counselling sessions, in addition to involving a professional.

Long-term success may depend on positive family actions, as this fosters a supportive environment,” he said.

Invite an expert

Abayomi said professional help should be sought to address the underlying triggers of substance abuse. He explained that employing a mental health specialist for the child will support recovery efforts and create a nurturing environment.

“Cognitive behavioural therapy is one therapeutic strategy that can assist in addressing underlying difficulties, creating coping mechanisms,” he added.

Establish discipline

The psychologist further said parents should create a structured and supportive environment at home and establish clear rules and consequences related to substance use, while also providing positive reinforcement for healthy behaviours.

This will help the child understand that there are consequences for certain actions and rewards for good conduct.

He added that parents should “encourage the child to associate with peers who have a positive influence and allow them to join support groups.”

Afolabi also advised parents to reassess their values and rebuild character within the home. He said this would help reorient the child and other family members, leading them to adopt new morals and realign their lives for better living.

Never abandon them

Afolabi advised that when a child struggles with substance abuse, it is crucial for parents to provide consistent support and understanding, even in the face of setbacks.

“Abandoning the child during difficult times can increase feelings of shame and isolation, making recovery more challenging. Instead, parents should maintain open lines of communication, express unconditional love, and reinforce the idea that setbacks are part of the recovery journey,” she said.

Get medical help

Additionally, consulting a medical doctor for any complications arising from a child’s substance abuse is essential for their overall health and safety. Substance abuse can lead to various physical and mental health issues, including withdrawal symptoms and damage to vital organs. A healthcare professional can conduct comprehensive evaluations to identify any health complications and recommend appropriate treatments.",https://punchng.com/6-ways-to-handle-a-child-with-substance-abuse/,https://punchng.com
"FG, Lagos declare zero tolerance for malaria","The Federal Government and the Lagos State Government have jointly declared zero tolerance for malaria.

The declaration was made during the mid-term review of the Impact Project and the roadmap toward malaria elimination in Lagos on Thursday.

Speaking at the event, the Minister of Health, Muhammad Pate, commended the Lagos State Government for its leadership and dedication in the fight against malaria.

“I commend the Lagos State Government for pioneering this initiative and for its unwavering dedication to malaria control. This effort shows that with determination and innovation, we can overcome even the toughest challenges,” the minister said.

Pate appreciated national and international partners for their collaboration, reaffirming the Federal Ministry of Health’s commitment to supporting Lagos through the National Malaria Elimination Programme.

In his keynote address, the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, reaffirmed the state’s commitment to transitioning from a high malaria burden to a pre-elimination stage, ultimately paving the way for a malaria-free Lagos.

Sanwo-Olu stated that the state was leveraging evidence, technology, and collaboration to drive progress.

He emphasised the importance of reviewing field data to ensure the effective use of Rapid Diagnostic Tests and proper reporting from private pharmacies and PPMVs.

“This review is focused on accountability, scale, quality, and community ownership.

“We cannot tackle malaria just by focusing on clinics. Households and communities must step up by eliminating breeding sites, getting tested promptly, and trusting the health system,” the governor said.

In June, the FG reaffirmed its commitment to collaborate with states to eliminate malaria, recognising the disease as a critical public health challenge.

With efforts focused on reducing the prevalence and impact of malaria, the government said it aimed to strengthen strategies that would accelerate progress towards a malaria-free nation.

The Minister of State for Health and Social Welfare, Iziaq Salako, said this in Abuja, in a statement signed by Alaba Balogun, Deputy Director of Information and Public Relations of the ministry.

“This strategy fosters collaboration between the Federal Government and sub-national governments, enabling better tracking of annual operations and implementation plans at the state level under a unified healthcare policy,” he said.",https://punchng.com/fg-lagos-declare-zero-tolerance-for-malaria/,https://punchng.com
NOA raises awareness on suicide prevention in Jigawa,"As the world marks World Suicide Prevention Day, the National Orientation Agency is joining the global community to raise awareness and break the stigma surrounding suicide.

It was reported that every year, over 720,000 lives are lost globally to suicide, with each loss deeply affecting families and communities.

In Nigeria, approximately 15,000 people die by suicide annually, with a rate of 6.9 per 100,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.

Earlier, the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare called for renewed action to protect lives and reduce stigma around mental illness in Nigeria.

The figure is likely underreported due to stigma and the country’s laws criminalising suicide.

It was observed that the main causes of suicidal behaviour in Nigeria include mental health conditions like depression, trauma, stress, social isolation, substance abuse, and chronic pain or illness, economic hardship, poverty, unemployment, and domestic violence, amongst others.

The NOA awareness campaign comes as a reminder that suicide is preventable as countries globally commemorate World Suicide Day this Wednesday.

In a statement made available to newsmen on Wednesday in Dutse, the state capital, by the NOA Director in the state, Ahmad Tijjani, the agency said that by creating awareness and promoting hope, people can work together to prevent suicides and support those in need.

“Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one’s own death,” he said.

According to Tijjani, suicide is a complex and multifaceted issue that can be influenced by a range of factors, including mental health conditions, trauma and stress, social isolation, substance abuse, and chronic pain or illness.

The NOA Director emphasised the importance of taking appropriate steps in preventing suicides, promoting hope, and supporting those with mental health issues.

“This year’s theme, ‘Creating Hope Through Action,’ highlights the need for collective action to prevent suicides,” he stated.

Explaining more on the theme, the Director emphasises the importance of taking concrete steps to prevent suicides, saying that “this includes providing support to those in need, promoting mental health awareness, and encouraging individuals to seek help when struggling with mental health issues.”

He urged the public to be informed and take action to prevent suicides.

Mr Tijjani further stated that “suicide prevention requires a collective effort, and the NOA is committed to playing its part, adding that “by raising awareness and breaking the stigma surrounding mental health issues, we can create a supportive environment that encourages individuals to seek help.

However, the Director urges everyone to join the effort to prevent suicides and promote mental health awareness. By doing so, we can create a safer and more supportive environment for all.

He revealed that NOA remains committed to promoting mental health awareness and preventing suicides in Jigawa state.",https://punchng.com/noa-raises-awareness-on-suicide-prevention-in-jigawa/,https://punchng.com
"Your life matters, FG tells Nigerians on world suicide prevention day","The Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare is calling for renewed action to protect lives and reduce stigma around mental illness as Nigeria joined the global community to mark World Suicide Prevention Day on Wednesday.

The ministry said, “… We can remind you of this: your life matters, and hope is real.”

The day was created to draw attention to suicide as a preventable public health issue and to mobilise governments, organisations, and communities worldwide in reducing stigma and promoting empathy.

The annual observance, first initiated in 2003 by the International Association for Suicide Prevention in collaboration with the World Health Organisation, is aimed at raising awareness, reducing the stigma around suicide, and fostering stronger international and community-based responses.

IASP, founded in 1960 by psychiatrist Erwin Ringel and psychologist Norman Farberow, continues to lead the initiative globally.

With WHO and partners like the World Federation for Mental Health, the association emphasises that suicide can be prevented through community support, professional care, and policies that prioritise mental well-being.

The 2025 theme, “Creating Hope Through Action,” emphasises the power of small, meaningful acts to inspire hope and save lives.

The Ministry wrote on its official X handle, “Hey, Nigeria… surprise surprise: we actually care about your mental health more than you think. Today is #WorldSuicidePreventionDay2025, and while we can’t give you free jollof therapy or a hug through this screen, we can remind you of this: your life matters, and hope is real.”

Along with the tweet, a pictorial statement was shared.

In the statement, the Ministry stressed that Nigeria is scaling up its response. It noted that the National Mental Health Policy now integrates mental health into primary healthcare, while the Mental Health Act, signed in 2023, has strengthened rights, services, and protections for people living with mental health conditions.

“Efforts are underway to expand mental health awareness campaigns and crisis support services nationwide,” the Ministry said, reaffirming government commitment to tackling the issue.

The Ministry further underscored the role of communities, families, faith leaders, and workplaces in prevention, stressing that suicide prevention must be seen as a shared responsibility. It also reminded Nigerians that stigma remains a major challenge, pointing out that “in Nigeria, thousands of lives are lost annually, yet many cases go unreported due to stigma.”

The Ministry urged Nigerians to check in on friends and loved ones, listen without judgment, and seek help when needed. It added that professional support, counselling, and crisis resources are available, with health workers trained to provide care.

By aligning with global efforts, Nigeria reinforced its message that no one should feel alone in the dark. As the Ministry noted, “Feelings change. Pain is temporary, hope is real.”

By marking the day, Nigeria joined the global call to challenge stereotypes, support those in crisis, and foster a culture where mental health is taken as seriously as physical health.",https://punchng.com/your-life-matters-fg-tells-nigerians-on-world-suicide-prevention-day/,https://punchng.com
One in 10 children worldwide living with obesity — UNICEF report,"Childhood obesity has overtaken underweight as the most common form of malnutrition among school-aged children and adolescents, UNICEF said in a new report released Tuesday.

The study, Feeding Profit: How Food Environments are Failing Children, shows that one in ten children, about 188 million worldwide, are living with obesity.

“Obesity surpassed underweight as the more prevalent form of malnutrition this year, affecting 1 in 10, or 188 million school-aged children and adolescents, and placing them at risk of life-threatening disease,” UNICEF said in the report.

Since 2000, obesity among children aged 5–19 has risen from 3 per cent to 9.4 per cent, while underweight has declined from nearly 13 per cent to 9.2 per cent.

“When we talk about malnutrition, we are no longer just talking about underweight children,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.

“Obesity is a growing concern that can impact the health and development of children. Ultra-processed food is increasingly replacing fruits, vegetables and protein at a time when nutrition plays a critical role in children’s growth, cognitive development and mental health.”

The report notes that obesity now exceeds underweight in all regions except sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

It warns that the rise is being driven by the growing availability and marketing of ultra-processed foods, which dominate shops and schools and reach young audiences through digital platforms.

“In many countries, we are seeing the double burden of malnutrition, the existence of stunting and obesity,” Russell added.

“Nutritious and affordable food must be available to every child to support their growth and development. We urgently need policies that support parents and caretakers to access nutritious and healthy foods for their children.”",https://punchng.com/one-in-10-children-worldwide-living-with-obesity-unicef-report/,https://punchng.com

"Dilapidated classrooms, blown-off roofs plague Oyo school","Students and teachers of Methodist Secondary Grammar School, Ogbomoso, Oyo State, are set to resume the 2025/2026 academic session amid blown-off roofs, dilapidated infrastructure, abandoned classrooms and school land encroachment.

The deteriorating state of the school is contained in a Save Our Soul message by the alumni (1982 set) made available to The PUNCH.

The SOS portrays audiovisuals of long-term abandonment and neglect of a school, which was once a student’s pride in Ogbomoso.

An old student of the school, Kunle Alagbe, lamented the shock received when the 1982 set visited the school.

Alagbe said, “When we got to the school, almost all the roofs of buildings in the school had been blown off by the wind. It is not habitable for students anymore.

“Back then, we had three blocks: the laboratory, the student classes, and the administrative block. Those structures have deteriorated.”

He lamented that the state of the school is worsened by inadequate funding.

“Inadequate funding has led to the deterioration today, as hope for a better future fades each passing day.

“Sadly, students are forced to navigate a learning landscape that is anything but conducive,” Alagbe stated.

A teacher in the school, Mrs Oyewole R.T., called for the intervention of the government and alumni, noting that the present state of the school makes effective teaching difficult.

“Many of the classrooms are condemned.

When I was first posted to this school, JSS1, JSS2, and JSS3 each had three classes, but now, we pack all the students together.

This has made it difficult for the teachers to effectively teach students,” Oyewole said.

A student in the school, simply named Barakat, decried, “We don’t have enough classrooms. We are 86 in a class.”

Another teacher, Mr E. O. Adewuyi, stressed that the school also faced land encroachment, while the school land was a path for people going to the market.

Adewuyi said, “We have a lot of challenges. There is an issue of encroachment of the school by a royal family in Ogbomoso. The government won the case twice, but the encroachment remains an issue.

“People have turned the school into a passage, thereby disrupting academic activities, especially when people are going to the Arada market, who use the school as an access road.

“We are appealing to the concerned authorities to help us fence the allotted land that belongs to the school.”

Another alumnus, Michael Olapade, lamented that the students and teachers inhabited an unsafe environment, coupled with encroachment as people have built houses on the perceived school land.

Olapade said, “The school is now a shadow of its former self. Land grabbing is an issue; the school deteriorates further with every fracas by the community heads in the area.

“The safety of students has been compromised, and the school ground is a playground for troublemakers. With the school left unguarded, open to intruders, staff and students face assault from all sorts of individuals.

“The sense of security is stripped away, rendering students vulnerable. Land encroachment has drastically altered the landscape around the school. Houses are being built right within the school premises.”

School principal, Mrs Ojo Aderinola, appealed to the state government and the Methodist Church to intervene in the interest of students’ learning.

Old students, including Mrs Ojo Comfort and Mr Gabriel Ajiboye, reverberated calls on the state government and alumni for renovation of infrastructure in the school.

“Some of the land we left behind has been encroached on. We appeal to the government to come to the aid of the school.

“We call on the Oyo State Government, the Commissioner for Education, the Ogbomoso South Local Government, Parent Teacher Association and Alumni to help rebuild our alma mater,” Ajiboye said.

Calls and messages to the State Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Mr Segun Olayiwola, for a reaction were unanswered as of the time of filing the report.",https://punchng.com/dilapidated-classrooms-blown-off-roofs-plague-oyo-school/,https://punchng.com
"Back-to-school: Lagos council chair begins 5,000 bags’ distribution","Ahead of resumption for the 2025/2026 academic session, the Chairman, Òdì-Olowo/Olowo-Ojuwoye Local Council Development Area, Seyi Jakande, has started the distribution of over 5,000 school bags and other educational materials to pupils in public primary and special needs schools in the local council area.

Jakande explained that the initiative was a deliberate mission to alleviate the financial stress that families face during the resumption period.

“By providing these essential educational materials at no cost, we are helping parents keep money in their pockets while their children return to school prepared,” Jakande said.

He urged the pupils to stay committed to their studies.

“Hard work does not kill; it is the lack of effort that leads to missed opportunities. Many of you have dreams of becoming leaders, such as governors, chairmen, or even presidents.

The journey begins with dedication to your education,” Jakande added.

He said the Back-to-School initiative is one of several educational interventions under the council’s broader agenda in Health and Environmental Sustainability, Education and Empowerment, Works and Security, Agriculture, Tourism, and Culture.

He spoke of other programmes of the education leg of the HEWA agenda to include Summer Boot Camp, distribution of free GCE forms, and mock examinations for students.

“These efforts aim to remove financial barriers and boost academic excellence among students in the LCDA,” he said.

Speaking at the event, the Council Manager, Afolake Otenaike, commended the initiative as a milestone in the community’s collective effort to ensure that no child is left behind in the pursuit of quality education.

“This effort is about giving hope to families, reducing the financial burden on parents, and most importantly, sending a clear message to our children that their dreams are valid and their future truly matters,” Otenaike said.

Otenaike charged the pupils to return to school with pride and a strong sense of purpose.

Otenaike said, “To our dear pupils, we want you to go to school with pride, with your heads held high, knowing that your community believes in you. Make the most of every opportunity, study hard, respect your teachers and parents, and always strive for excellence.

“To the parents and guardians, we thank you for your continuous support and commitment to your children’s education.

"Separated conjoined twins Hassana, Hussaina return to Kano after Saudi surgery","Tukur Muntari

Kano State Governor, Abba Yusuf, on Friday received the Nigerian conjoined twins, Hassana and Hussaina, who returned to the country after undergoing a successful separation surgery in Saudi Arabia.

The twins, who arrived at the Malam Aminu Kano International Airport with their family, were welcomed to a warm reception by government officials, community members, and representatives of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

The life-saving operation was carried out at the King Abdullah Specialist Children’s Hospital in Riyadh under the directives of King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Hassana and Hussaina had been flown to Saudi Arabia in October 2023, where a team of 38 specialists, including pediatric surgeons, neurosurgeons, and plastic surgeons, performed the delicate procedure that lasted about 14 hours and was completed in nine stages.

Doctors discovered that the twins were joined at the lower abdomen, pelvis, and spine, sharing vital structures that made the case particularly complex.

After careful planning, a multi-disciplinary team of 38 consultants and specialists, including experts in pediatric surgery, neurosurgery, orthopaedics, urology, anaesthesia, and plastic surgery, embarked on the delicate procedure.

Speaking at the airport, Yusuf expressed gratitude to the Saudi authorities for sponsoring the surgery and pledged that the state government would take responsibility for the girls’ welfare, including their education up to the university level.

The Consular General of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in Kano, Khalil Ahmed Al-Admawi, who was present at the airport to welcome the family, described the success of the surgery as a demonstration of the Kingdom’s commitment to humanitarian service.

“Saudi Arabia would continue to extend medical assistance and goodwill to countries in need through King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre, especially Nigeria with which it shares historic ties,” he said.

He said the separation of Hassana and Husaina marks the 65th successful operation under the Saudi Siamese Twins Separation Program, which has provided care for 150 sets of conjoined twins from 25 countries over the past 35 years.

The program has become one of the most prominent medical humanitarian initiatives globally, showcasing Saudi Arabia’s expertise in pediatric surgery and its dedication to supporting vulnerable families.

"FG spends N23bn on PHC revitalisation, cautions against sabotage","Sodiq Ojuroungbe

The Federal Government has claimed to have spent over N23 billion on the revitalisation of Primary Health Care Centres across the country as part of efforts to strengthen Nigeria’s primary healthcare system and improve access to essential services.

The government also issued a stern warning to health workers and government officials against diverting or sabotaging medical equipment and essential drugs being distributed to PHCs nationwide.

The Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr. Muyi Aina, said this on Thursday in Abuja during the official flag-off of the distribution of medical equipment and health commodities to PHCs.

Providing a breakdown of the expenditure, Aina revealed that over N9 billion has been spent on procuring and deploying medical equipment, while more than N14 billion was used to procure essential health commodities such as drugs and vaccines.

Aina said that 1,295 PHCs have so far been completely refurbished, with 38 of them now benefiting from newly installed solar power systems.

He added that over 69,000 frontline health workers have been trained and provided with uniforms and work kits through partnerships, including support from the Renewed Hope Initiative led by the First Lady.

He also noted that some states were now taking ownership of the reforms by hiring additional healthcare personnel.

“Kaduna, for example, has recruited 216 skilled health attendants and 969 community-based health workers,” Aina said.

On maternal and child health, Aina highlighted progress under the Maternal and Child Health Initiative, revealing that 411,000 pregnant women have been enrolled across 21 states, with 30,587 already receiving care, including antenatal services and referrals for diagnostics.

The NPHCDA boss urged state governments to allocate more resources to staffing and maintaining PHCs to sustain the momentum.

He also called on Nigerians to support upcoming immunisation campaigns aimed at reaching over 109 million citizens aged 14 and below.

These campaigns, he said, will integrate measles and polio vaccinations with other key interventions such as nutrition and malaria prevention.

Also speaking, the Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Professor Muhammad Ali Pate, stressed that the initiative marks a critical milestone in the government’s agenda to rebuild a functional and accessible health system, particularly for underserved communities.

According to Pate, the health sector has suffered prolonged neglect, with many PHCs left in disrepair, lacking both manpower and essential resources.

He said the ongoing revitalisation efforts aim to reverse this trend by ensuring facilities are not only rebuilt but also fully equipped and adequately staffed.

He added, “For too long, our primary health care centres have languished. They are not very functional in many areas. Our mothers have to travel long distances for delivery, and many of them die in the process. Children missed their vaccinations. Communities didn’t have much hope.”

He warned that the government would not tolerate the diversion or misuse of the newly distributed supplies, vowing that anyone found culpable would face consequences, regardless of their position.

“We will not stand idly by while these resources are misused. Any frontline worker, any health facility manager, any local government or state official, or even federal official who diverts anything that is deployed to serve our people will face consequences,” Pate warned.

The minister described the distribution not as a symbolic event but as a tangible fulfilment of promises made two years ago under the Tinubu administration’s Renewed Hope Agenda to overhaul the primary health care system.

He stressed, “This is not just an event, but it is also a promise kept. Two years ago, we embarked on an ambitious effort to revitalise the primary health care system, setting targets, and now we are seeing that promise being kept.”

Pate, while acknowledging the contributions of development partners like GAVI, the Global Fund, WHO, UNICEF, and UNFPA, reaffirmed the Federal Government’s commitment to ensuring that no Nigerian is left behind in accessing quality healthcare.

“Today’s flag-off is further proof that the Nigerian health system can rise again and proof that President Bola Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda is real. Let us join together to build a health system that leaves no Nigerian behind,” he stated.",https://healthwise.punchng.com/fg-spends-n23bn-on-phc-revitalisation-cautions-against-sabotage/,https://punchng.com
NAFDAC sensitises fruit sellers in Billiri on dangers of calcium carbide,"Chima Azubuike

Following reports of artificial fruits ripening with calcium carbide in Billiri Local Government Area of Gombe State the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control on Friday carried out a sensitisation exercise.

Fruits provide the body with micronutrients that improve immunity and prevent diseases among other benefits. Fruit ripening is a unique aspect of plant development, which makes the fruit edible, softer, sweeter, more palatable, nutritious, and attractive.

However, the consumption of fruits such as mango, banana, plantain, guava, orange, grape, etc or any other fruits ripened with calcium carbide is dangerous to health.

Speaking during the exercise, NAFDAC’s Gombe State Coordinator, Pharmacist James Agada, said the agency’s intervention followed reports that some fruits in the area were suspected to have been ripened with calcium carbide.

“Calcium carbide poses serious health risks to consumers. Our intervention seeks to protect public health by encouraging fruit sellers to adopt safe practices,” Agada said.

On how sellers and buyers can identify artificially ripened fruits, Agada added, “Fruits artificially ripened with calcium carbide may be ripe on the skin, the inside remain unripe. You can identify such artificially ripened fruits if you notice that the fruits are all yellow whereas the stem is dark, this is true especially with banana and plantain. In addition, naturally ripened fruits usually have brown or black spots, while those artificially ripened have traces of powdery substances and peel off quickly.”

He added, “Consumption of fruits containing these impurities may cause cancer, heart, kidney and liver failure. They may also cause frequent thirst. irritation in mouth and nose, weakness, permanent skin damage, difficulty in swallowing, vomiting, skin ulcer and so forth.”

Agada explained that NAFDAC’s strategy was to educate and sensitise vendors before moving to enforcement.

“We want to appeal to the conscience of fruit sellers to do the right thing. But let me be clear—those who persist in violating the regulations will face sanctions. Protecting public health remains our priority,” he added.

Agada further urged fruit sellers to report anyone using calcium carbide and to always check for NAFDAC registration numbers on products. He also introduced the vendors to the Green Book app, NAPAMS, and Scan2Verify platforms, which can be used to confirm product authenticity.

In his response, the Chairman of the Fruit Sellers Association in Billiri LGA, Alhaji Murtala Mohammed, commended NAFDAC for the initiative and pledged the traders’ compliance with its guidelines.

“We are grateful to NAFDAC for this enlightenment. I want to warn our members against using calcium carbide because of its harmful effects. There are safer alternatives like pear and garden egg extracts that can be used for ripening fruits,” Mohammed said.

FG rallies African leaders for malaria elimination by 2030,"Sodiq Ojuroungbe

The Federal Government has called for a renewed and aggressive continental strategy to eradicate malaria in Africa, following alarming statistics that show the disease claimed 597,000 lives across the continent in 2023 alone.

Speaking at the Meeting on Harnessing Africa’s Central Role Against Malaria – The Big Push, held on Thursday at the Abuja Continental Hotel, the Minister of State for Health and Social Welfare, Dr. Iziaq Salako, said Africa must adopt a more urgent and coordinated approach to eliminate the disease, which remains a leading cause of death despite being preventable and treatable.

Salako revealed that Africa accounted for 94 per cent of global malaria cases and 95 per cent of malaria deaths in 2023, amounting to 263 million infections and placing the region at the epicentre of the global malaria crisis.

“It is extremely distressing that malaria, a disease that is both preventable and treatable, continues to be a leading cause of illness and death in Nigeria and throughout the African continent,” Salako said.

He stressed that the current pace of action is insufficient to achieve the continent’s goal of eliminating malaria by 2030, urging stakeholders to deploy a “big push” that includes mobilising political will, resources, and innovation.

The meeting was hosted by the Nigerian government in collaboration with the Roll Back Malaria Partnership, the African Leaders Malaria Alliance, and with the support of the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.

The minister highlighted several emerging threats to malaria control, including increasing resistance to insecticides, climate change-induced extreme weather events, ongoing humanitarian crises, and widening funding gaps.

He said insecticide resistance was reversing progress in some regions, as mosquitoes adapt to existing control methods.

He added that floods and droughts, driven by climate change, have created new breeding grounds for malaria vectors while disrupting healthcare systems.

Salako also pointed out that displaced populations in conflict or disaster zones remain highly vulnerable due to a lack of access to prevention and treatment.

The health minister warned that closing the funding gap was critical to sustaining the fight, adding that more investment is needed in research, development of new tools, and expanding access to treatment and prevention.

“Available resources to fuel research, develop new tools and strategies, and ensure access to effective treatment still fall short,” he said.

The minister called on governments, NGOs, private sector actors, and communities to strengthen collaboration, ramp up education and awareness campaigns, and ensure wide distribution of tools such as insecticide-treated nets, malaria vaccines, and quality-assured combination therapies.

He also highlighted Nigeria’s renewed efforts, including the Advisory for Malaria Elimination in Nigeria, the Malaria Elimination Task Force, the test-and-treat strategy, and the introduction of the malaria vaccine as key components of the national response.

Salako stressed that defeating malaria would require a united front and sustained leadership.

He noted, “Countries that have eliminated the disease must persevere, adapt, and accelerate their efforts to outpace malaria’s relentless progress and prevent re-establishment.

“Those of us still battling the scourge must diligently operationalise existing strategies and implement new actions.”

"Kwara to cover 1m women, children in 2025 health plan","Dare Akogun

The Kwara State Government has launched the 2025 Integrated Health Outreach Programme, designed to enhance access to routine immunisation and primary healthcare services across all the 193 wards of the state.

The intervention, supported by development partners, will target 831,554 children under five, 166,309 infants under one year, and 207,885 pregnant women in the third and fourth quarters of the year.

Speaking on Monday at the launch held at the Primary Health Centre in Tanke, Ilorin, the Executive Secretary of the State Primary Health Care Development Agency, Prof. Nusirat Elelu, said the exercise would provide routine immunisation, tetanus vaccines for pregnant women and adolescent girls, as well as general health checks including blood pressure, blood sugar, body mass index, and nutrition services.

She added that referral systems had been established for cases requiring higher-level medical attention, while a special nomadic outreach strategy would extend services to remote settlements.

“The programme is targeted at achieving more than 80 per cent coverage for the third dose of the pentavalent vaccine this year and to build sustained demand for ante-natal services,” Elelu said.

The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health, Dr. Ayodeji Abdullahi Taoheed, said the initiative reflected the administration’s commitment to strengthening healthcare delivery through recruitment, facility upgrades, and policy reforms.

In their respective goodwill messages, representatives of the World Health Organisation, African Field Epidemiology Network, and the National Orientation Agency pledged continued support for the state’s health programmes.

"Open defecation: Lagos to build 10,000 public toilets after PUNCH Healthwise report","Idowu Abdullahi

The Lagos State Government has announced plans to build 10,000 public toilets across the state to eliminate open defecation.

The move, it said, was in line with its “commitment to ensure all residents have access to safe, affordable water and good sanitation services across the metropolis”.

The Permanent Secretary, Office of Drainage Services and Water Resources, Engr. Mahamood Adegbite, disclosed this during the Lagos Water Partnership – Steering Committee Meeting held at the Protea Hotel, Alausa, Ikeja, according to a statement on Thursday.

The move comes shortly after a PUNCH Healthwise report, which detailed the dire health and environmental risks of inadequate sanitation facilities in the state.

The report titled “Open defecation: Inside Lagos motor parks where faeces, flies welcome passengers” chronicled how Lagos, despite being Nigeria’s commercial centre, has many of its major motor parks lacking public toilets and other WASH facilities, with people defecating or urinating openly in spaces around the parks.

Consequently, in the Thursday statement signed by Kunle Adeshina, Director of Public Affairs, Ministry of Environment and Water Resources, Adegbite said the steering committee meeting underscores the collective commitment to transforming Lagos into a water-resilient megacity.

According to him, every decision made at the meeting would have an impact on millions of Lagosians.

Adegbite emphasised “particularly, the proposal for 100 public facility units containing 10,000 toilet units across Lagos communities, which demonstrated the commitment to ending open defecation in Lagos State while creating investment opportunities.”

He added, “The seven vision statements for Lagos’ water resilience – improved mapping, enhanced infrastructure data, expanded access, stronger investment frameworks, upgraded sanitation, digital transformation, and reduced water losses – require the high-level coordination only we can provide.”

In its report, PUNCH Healthwise detailed how open defecation lies below the surface in the busy centre of Lagos.

From Oshodi, Mile 2 to Iyana-Iba and other motor parks, poop hides in corners, behind fences, and in makeshift stalls.

The foul smell follows the city’s main transportation route, posing a daily threat to the health and well-being of thousands of users.

Commuters, including bus drivers, traders, and particularly homeless youths who sleep at parks or under bridges around the area, defecate or urinate behind parked buses, stalls, rail tracks, or enclosed spaces.

With an estimated population of over 21 million residents, this puts public health at risk in one of Africa’s most densely populated cities.

Exposed! Lagos supermarkets selling expired groceries to shoppers,"Some Lagos supermarkets are selling expired groceries and edibles under the guise of ‘promotional offers’, deceiving unsuspecting shoppers. With regulatory bodies like the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control and the Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency turning a blind eye, PUNCH Healthwise investigates the rising trend of food fraud and life-threatening risks hidden behind discount stickers and flashy promo signs. SODIQ OJUROUNGBE reports.

On a Saturday morning, Daniel Olanrewaju set out to make the weekend a memorable one for his children. The plan was just to make a delicious plate of fried yams, served hot with ketchup as a weekend treat for his three young kids. Olanrewaju made a quick dash to a popular supermarket in the Ikeja area of Lagos, picked up a bottle of ketchup from the ‘promo’ shelf, and returned home without a second thought.

Back in the kitchen, the oil sizzled, and the fried yams browned to perfection. Everything was going according to plan.

Unknown to Olanrewaju, the ketchup he had purchased from the supermarket had expired three weeks earlier. As soon as one of his sons tasted the ketchup, he spat it out, complaining of the bad taste.

Olanrewaju thought it was just his son’s way of trying to get out of eating, but little did he know that his other two children would soon fall victim to the expired product.

About an hour after the two other children devoured the ketchup-laden fried yams, one of them started complaining of a stomach ache.

Alarmed, Olanrewaju decided to taste the ketchup himself, and what he discovered was horrifying.

“The taste was horrible. Sour, strange, almost fermented. That was when I checked the label and saw the expiry date. The product had expired more than three weeks before I bought it.

“It took medical intervention to take care of my child, who had eaten a lot of the expired ketchup. I was devastated, and I couldn’t believe that a simple trip to the supermarket could turn into a health crisis,” Olanrewaju recounted in an interview with PUNCH Healthwise.

Olanrewaju further revealed that this was not the first time he had bought expired groceries from a supermarket, only to discover later that they were expired.

“Before, I always thought maybe stores and supermarkets do promo because a product is not selling, but over time, I realised that they are only trying to push out expired and about-to-expire products on their shelves without proper explicit explanation for the customer to know,” he said.

“They will just sell it to you, and it’s only when you are observant or notice certain changes that you will check it and realise the product has expired. I have been a victim more than three times, and with my recent experience, I have vowed never to buy goods displayed on promo again,” he stated.

Expired pringles

For Temitope Ogunsanya, the memory still lingers, not because of any physical reaction but because of the lingering sense of betrayal. It was supposed to be a simple, thoughtful gesture.

His wife had casually mentioned craving something crunchy, and he figured a pack of the ever-popular Pringles would do the trick.

Array

So, on a Tuesday afternoon, he stopped by Jodjo Supermarket, a known retail outlet tucked along the busy stretch of Ijegun Road in Lagos. The store, always bustling with foot traffic and lined with discount signs, was running a “Buy One, Get One 50% Off” promo on snacks. Ogunsanya, like most Lagosians trying to stretch every naira, jumped at the offer.

He recalled, “There were all sorts of items stacked on the promo shelf, including chocolates, biscuits, and soft drinks. I picked two packs of Pringles. Everything looked normal. I didn’t even think of checking the expiration date. Why would I? It is a big supermarket.”

Ogunsanya took the cans home, and he and his wife opened one that night while watching a movie. The taste didn’t seem off, not obviously, and there were no initial side effects.

It wasn’t until the next day, while tossing the empty can into the dustbin, that Ogunsanya noticed that the expiry date was over a month old.

“I froze! I called my wife immediately, and she laughed it off, but I didn’t find it funny. What if it were something more perishable? What if it had affected her or made her sick?” he told PUNCH Healthwise, shaking his head.

Although he and his wife escaped unscathed, the incident left a bitter aftertaste.

He added, “I used to believe that big supermarkets were more reliable. But now, I look at them with suspicion. The trust is gone.

“Since that day, I don’t just check the expiry date; I double-check it. Sometimes, I even put the item back if I feel the date is too close.”

Pattern of deceit

Stories like that of Olanrewaju and Ogunsanya are becoming disturbingly common. Their experiences suggest that this isn’t just a case of occasional lapses in quality control but part of a systemic manipulation of consumer trust.

Findings by PUNCH Healthwise reveal a troubling trend that has led to a rise in the sale of expired or near-expiry products, driven by a calculated pattern of retail deceit playing out across supermarkets in Lagos.

Behind the brightly coloured promo tags and carefully worded sales pitches lies a deliberate effort to exploit consumer trust and offload questionable stock.

To uncover the pattern of deceit that is widespread across Lagos supermarkets, our correspondent, posing as a customer, visited several supermarkets in different parts of the metropolis and was shocked to discover expired products on their shelves.

Array

In some cases, the products had expired months ago, while others were mere days away from their expiration dates.

From Ogba to Ishaga, Ijegun to Victoria Island, and down to Lekki, PUNCH Healthwise discovered a growing strategy used by many supermarkets. Products nearing, or already past, their expiration dates are quietly removed from regular shelves and repackaged under labels like ‘promotions’ or ‘flash sales’.

It was observed that prices are slashed, signs scream urgency, and unsuspecting shoppers, thinking they have found a bargain, walk away with products that should never have been sold in the first place.

These deceptive sales tactics rely on psychological tricks like urgency, scarcity, and the illusion of savings. They thrive on the economic reality that many Nigerians, struggling with inflation and rising living costs, often don’t check expiry labels, too focused on stretching their money as far as it will go.

Dangerous trend hidden in plain sight

Beyond the personal testimonies of shoppers who unknowingly bought expired food items disguised as discounted deals, PUNCH Healthwise launched an undercover investigation to uncover the widespread retail deceit.

Between August 25 and September 4, 2025, our correspondent visited more than eight supermarkets across different local government areas in Lagos State. These included stores in highbrow neighbourhoods like Lekki and middle-income areas such as Ishaga, Ogba, and Abule-Egba.

Array

At Renne Supermarket in Lekki Phase 1, visited on August 25, several items displayed prominently in the promo section were found to be expired or just days away from expiration.

A premium coffee product, Chicco D’Oro, had already expired, while another brand, Bristol Decaf, was only two days from its expiry date at the time of purchase.

Despite their expired or near-expired status, the price slash was dramatic and almost unbelievable. The Chicco D’Oro, once sold for N9,800, was reduced to N500. Similarly, Bristol Decaf, originally priced at N7,000, was also sold for N500.

Other items on the shelf followed the same pattern, with Cadbury Snack Shortcake (140g), initially N7,600, which was reduced to N3,000, while a 500g pack of Jacob Kronug dropped from N15,500 to N9,900. Shoppers browsing the aisles, unaware or perhaps too trusting, reached for these deals without hesitation — never suspecting the risk attached.

Array

On August 29, our correspondent visited Medzie Supermarket in Abule-Egba. There, items like White Dats and Pune Cocoa remained openly displayed on the shelves, despite having expired over two weeks earlier, on August 12 and 13, respectively.

No warnings were placed on the products, and they were not removed from the racks. In fact, they were among the more visibly highlighted “special offers” in the store.

Three days later, on September 3, our correspondent visited Evabest Supermarket in Iju-Ishaga, where the situation was just as troubling. Four items purchased from the store, including tomato ketchup, Dano canned milk, Oral-B toothpaste and Ovaltine, were discovered to have expired. The tomato ketchup had been out of date since April 14, 2025. The Dano and Ovaltine products expired on August 12, while the Oral-B expired in July 2025. Yet all of these were still being sold as part of ongoing promotional deals.

That same day, at So Rite Supermarket in Ishaga, our correspondent purchased a pack of digestive biscuits prominently displayed on the promo shelf. Upon checking, the biscuit was set to expire by September 13, just less than 10 days away. Another item, Ovaltine, also on flash sale, had less than ten days left before its expiration date of September 12. None of these products had any markings to indicate their near-expiry status. There were no disclaimers, no staff warnings, only the discount sticker.

Array

The following day, September 4, PUNCH Healthwise visited Market Square Supermarket, also in Lekki Phase 1. There, a bottle of Schweppes, previously sold for N515, was now offered at just N150. It was set to expire the very next day, September 5. Another product, a bottle of tomato ketchup, which had been retailing for N3,375 was slashed to N700, and would expire within ten days, by September 13.

The trend continued with a carbonated drink from the brand Rubicon, whose label simply read “September 2025” with no specific expiry date. This lack of detail raises serious concerns, especially considering that many other items on the shelf bore similarly vague expiration markings — stating only the month and year, but omitting the exact day.

Array

Across all these visits, the same pattern repeated itself. Products that were expired or dangerously close to expiration were removed from standard shelves, relabeled as “promo items,” and heavily discounted.

Our correspondent observed that there were no warnings provided. The discount signs were colourful and persuasive, drawing customers in with the illusion of a good deal — when in fact, they were being sold what could very well be expired poison.

PUNCH Healthwise’s findings suggest that this is not a series of isolated incidents or oversights but a calculated and coordinated retail tactic that depends on the hope that buyers are either too distracted, too trusting, or too desperate for bargains to check expiration dates.

For many unsuspecting customers, these discounted products appear to be a lucky bargain, especially in today’s harsh economic climate. Unaware that the items are already expired or just days from expiration, they purchase them in bulk, stock them at home, and continue consuming them over the course of weeks or even months. In doing so, they unknowingly put their health, and in some cases, their lives, at serious risk.

A sales representative at one of the popular supermarkets in Lagos, who spoke with PUNCH Healthwise on the condition of anonymity, revealed that the practice of hiding expired or nearly expired items under the guise of promotional sales is not an isolated act, adding that it is a well-known and routine strategy across many retail outlets in the state.

According to her, the moment a product is close to its expiration date, sometimes just days away, management typically instructs staff to move such items to the promo shelf, rather than discard or clearly label them as near-expiry.

She said, “To be honest, it’s normal in many stores. Once an item is getting close to the expiry date, instead of removing it from circulation, we are told to put it on promo. We reduce the price and make it look like a special offer. Most customers don’t bother checking the date — they just see the discount and rush it.”

She further explained that staff members are often discouraged from pointing out expiry concerns to customers unless specifically asked.

In some cases, she alleged, price stickers are deliberately placed over the expiry dates to obscure them from view.

“It is not every staff member who is comfortable with it, but we don’t really have a choice. If you talk too much, you can lose your job. And some store managers are even worse — they know it’s wrong, but they still encourage it because they don’t want to waste stock,” she added.

Clear violation

Despite NAFDAC’s clear and comprehensive guidelines on how expired and unwholesome products should be handled, none of the supermarkets visited during the PUNCH Healthwise investigation showed any visible signs of compliance.

According to NAFDAC’s official Guidelines for the Handling and Disposal of Unwholesome Medicines and Regulated Products, food items and other consumables deemed unwholesome, including expired goods, must not be sold, redistributed, or disguised as fit for consumption under any circumstances.

The guidelines document obtained by PUNCH Healthwise from NAFDAC’s website stated that all establishments dealing in food, medicine, cosmetics, or any regulated product are mandated to set aside a clearly demarcated area for storing expired or unwholesome goods.

“Demarcate an area for storing expired/unwholesome medicines and NAFDAC-regulated products which shall be labelled conspicuously with the words ‘Expired Products’, ‘Not for Sale’, or in red ink,” a part of the guidelines read.

But in every store visited by our correspondent, there were no such designated areas. Expired products were not quarantined, not labelled, and not separated from items meant for sale.

In fact, they were placed on promotional shelves right next to active, non-expired goods, often disguised with aggressive price slashes and attention-grabbing signage.

There were no warning labels, no signs indicating “Near Expiry”, and certainly no restricted zones for expired stock. What should have been flagged for disposal or regulatory verification was instead packaged as a bargain, ready to be picked up by any unsuspecting shopper walking through the aisles.

The Counterfeit and Fake Drugs and Unwholesome Processed Foods (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act Cap C.34, LFN 2004, also leaves no room for interpretation.

Section 1 of the Act criminalises the manufacture, sale, and distribution of counterfeit or fake drugs and unwholesome processed food, declaring such practices punishable by imprisonment without the option of a fine upon conviction.

It further empowers law enforcement and regulatory agencies to seize, confiscate, and prosecute those in possession of expired or harmful consumables being sold for human use.

According to the Act, selling unwholesome products attracts penalties including a fine worth N500,000 or imprisonment of not less than five years.

The actions observed in Lagos supermarkets visited by PUNCH Healthwise clearly fall within this legal definition.

Legislation lapses

Legal experts argue that even supermarkets claiming ignorance cannot be absolved of liability, noting that the Act holds both individuals and corporate entities accountable, including owners, managers, and staff who facilitate or fail to report such sales.

A consumer protection lawyer based in Lagos, Barr. Tayo Ogunlana, expressed concerns that despite multiple violations across various stores and chains, there is little evidence of widespread crackdowns, penalties, or closures.

He lamented that regulatory bodies appear reactive rather than proactive, stepping in only when complaints become too loud to ignore.

He stressed, “Let’s be clear: any supermarket or store selling expired goods is committing a punishable offence under Nigerian law.

“It doesn’t matter whether someone got sick or not. The very act of offering expired products for sale is grounds for prosecution.

“How many times have you seen any supermarket shut down for selling expired goods?

“You might see small vendors being harassed, but the big stores? They get a slap on the wrist, if anything at all.”

NAFDAC’s silent watch

Despite being statutorily empowered to ensure that all consumable goods in Nigeria meet safety standards both before and after they enter the market, findings by PUNCH Healthwise show the absence of visible regulatory intervention by NAFDAC, particularly in Lagos supermarkets, where expired and unwholesome food products are being sold openly.

A food policy researcher, Mariam Kuranga, expressed deep concern over the agency’s apparent inaction, describing NAFDAC as “a toothless dog that has failed to effectively police the activities of many big-name retail outlets operating across Nigeria.”

“In reality, NAFDAC seems more invested in raiding sachet water factories in remote towns than tackling the real danger, high-end supermarkets in Lekki and other urban areas that are knowingly selling expired food items. Their silence is fuelling this crime,” she told PUNCH Healthwise.

Kuranga added that expired products are just one part of the problem.

According to her, some of these retail chains are also guilty of stocking unregistered or foreign-imported products without NAFDAC approval.

She added, “Walk into some of these stores, and you will find imported drinks, cereals, and snacks that bear no NAFDAC registration number. Some don’t even carry proper labelling, yet they’re sold daily in full view of the public. Where is NAFDAC? Who is monitoring this?”

On the need for clear demarcation and labelling of near-expiry products, Kuranga said many stores deliberately blur the lines between what is safe for consumption and what is not, misleading consumers, especially those shopping in a hurry or unaware of food safety guidelines.

“It is completely unethical to display a product that will expire in less than two weeks right next to fresh stock, without any warning label,” she said.

She stressed that products approaching expiration must not only be separated but also clearly marked, as stipulated by NAFDAC guidelines.

She maintained, “Anything less than that is fraud. And when someone falls sick or worse, it becomes a public health risk. These supermarkets are playing with lives.”

Kuranga called on NAFDAC to go beyond press releases and workshops and to begin conducting random compliance checks in major retail chains, not just informal markets.

She stressed, “If they can deploy task forces to hunt down fake malaria drugs in the North, then they can certainly inspect the so-called elite supermarkets poisoning Lagos families with expired ketchup and canned milk.”

Lurking danger

Food experts warned that consuming expired food could lead to food poisoning, which can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and fever.

While noting that the expiration date is based on scientific testing, determining when the food item is at its safest and freshest, the experts stressed that consuming expired foods is a risk that should not be taken lightly.

A nutritionist/dietitian, Odunayo Sunday, explained that consuming food past expiration dates increases the likelihood of harmful bacteria growth, toxin formation, and nutrient degradation.

She said, “Expiration dates are not arbitrary. They indicate the point beyond which the quality and safety of the product can no longer be guaranteed. Consuming food past this date increases the likelihood of harmful bacteria growth, toxin formation, and nutrient degradation.”

Beyond immediate food poisoning, the food expert added that prolonged consumption of expired products can lead to more severe health consequences, especially for vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.

According to her, chronic exposure to spoiled or contaminated foods may result in digestive disorders, allergic reactions, and, in some cases, long-term organ damage.

She pointed out that certain foods, like dairy, meat, and seafood, pose higher risks when expired compared to dry goods or canned items, which may sometimes retain quality beyond their printed dates if stored properly.

She urged consumers to always check expiration dates carefully and to avoid being swayed by attractive promotional offers on products that are nearing or past their expiry.

The nutritionist also called on regulatory agencies to intensify surveillance and enforcement efforts in supermarkets and markets across Lagos to curb the sale of expired foods.

A food quality assurance officer, Mr Immanuel Basil, told one of our correspondents that the expiry dates of consumer goods are directly related to their quality.

He added, “Expiry dates are very crucial in the production of Fast Moving Consumer Goods. As a matter of fact, it’s one of the elements of quality consumer goods. It’s also not news that some FMCGs make lots of mistakes with expiry dates.

“This is seen when their products on counters or in distribution begin to deteriorate even before the quoted expiry dates. So, the calculation of expiry dates is very pivotal to quality.

“This is especially true because these goods have or could have several different components that go into the production, blending and can react with each other in one way or the other to give a different outcome than expected.

“The packaging material, storage conditions and handling of the products in transit also play a role in all of these.”

Basil noted that the quality of products would deteriorate before their expiry dates, and consuming such could have serious health implications.

“Expiry dates are very important and flouting them could be injurious to health. I will recommend that consumers be careful with products. Products can go off before the expiry date, so it’s important to be mindful and flag off any cases to the company’s customer care for corrections and retrieval of batches already in distribution.

“The major implications of consuming expired products range from mild to severe stomach upset, allergies, and, in rare cases, death, and a bad experience with these products,” he added.

Not our usual business practice — Rennie Supermarket reacts

A director of Rennie Supermarket, simply identified as Christian, apologised following our correspondent’s discovery of an expired product on the shelves of one of its outlets.

In an exclusive conversation with our correspondent, Christian admitted that the presence of the expired item was a serious breach of standard procedure and assured the public that the supermarket does not intentionally sell expired goods.

“We are not allowed to sell expired products, and there is a clear protocol in place to handle such items. This is not in line with our business practice,” he said.

Christian expressed concern over the lapse and said an internal investigation was already underway to determine how the expired product bypassed the store’s quality control mechanisms.

He added, “If the product is expired, I would need to work with my internal team to find out how it ended up on the shelf. We have been in business for many years, and this is not what we stand for.”

He acknowledged that the supermarket has dedicated staff tasked with identifying and removing expired products and disclosed that the supermarket works closely with government regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with food safety standards.

“We have almost three staff members whose job is to handle expired items alone. So if something went wrong, it is clearly a human error. We’ll work on it,” Christian said.

According to him, the supermarket follows the Nigerian government’s guidelines, which stipulate that items nearing expiration must be clearly marked and sold at a reduced price to encourage quick purchase before they expire.

“No matter what, if a product is about to expire, we should indicate that and reduce the price before it gets to that point. That is the guideline,” he said.

Christian extended an apology on behalf of the supermarket to our correspondent and other patrons who may have had similar experiences.

“We are sorry for your bad experience. It is not our intention to be selling expired products and feeding people unsafe items. That’s not what we do here,” he said.

He promised that the supermarket would improve its internal checks and ensure expiry dates are prominently displayed alongside price reductions in the future.

So Rite Supermarket promises disciplinary action, audit

The management of So Rite Supermarket promised an immediate internal investigation to verify the claims made by our correspondent.

An auditor with the retail chain, Joseph Etim, who spoke with PUNCH Healthwise, revealed that the supermarket will take disciplinary action where necessary following concerns raised about product shelf-life monitoring at the outlet visited during the investigation.

While reiterating the outlet’s commitment to consumer safety, Etim stressed that the company has “zero tolerance” for expired or near-expiry goods being sold to customers.

According to him, the Managing Director of the company, who is currently out of the country, was informed of the situation and had mandated a full audit of the outlet involved.

“We take the issue of product expiration very seriously as a company. It is against our policy to display or sell expired items,” he stated.

Etim explained that the company operates a dedicated shelf for goods nearing expiry, which are to be clearly marked and disclosed to customers.

He added that the failure to follow these protocols by staff our correspondent met at the outlet constitutes a breach of internal procedure and would be addressed.

“If any staff failed to inform customers or wrongly displayed products, disciplinary measures will be taken. The branch manager will be held accountable for any deviation from company policy,” he said.

While noting that the company awaits further details to support the ongoing investigation, Etim maintained that routine checks by regulatory bodies such as the Standards Organisation of Nigeria and the Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency have not uncovered any violations in the past.

“Our outlets are regularly inspected by government agencies, and we’ve always maintained a clean record. This incident, however, is being treated with urgency,” he stated.

The So Rite Supermarket auditor assured its customers of its continued commitment to quality control, compliance with regulations, and consumer health standards.

Others decline comments

Efforts by PUNCH Healthwise to get reactions from other supermarkets involved proved abortive.

Our correspondent reached out to the outlets using the contact numbers printed on the receipts obtained during the visits. However, the lines were either unreachable or not connecting.

Messages sent via WhatsApp and SMS were not responded to as of the time this report was filed.

We can’t be everywhere – NAFDAC

Array

When contacted, the Resident Media Consultant to NAFDAC, Sayo Akintola, acknowledged the gravity of the situation but stressed the agency’s dependence on public cooperation for swift intervention.

“Like we always tell people, when you see something like this, we have our offices across the country, including Abuja. What we expect from you is to get evidence, probably the expired item, then notify our office.

“You have indirectly done that now, at least by calling me. But the missing leg of it is the physical evidence. We have to get hold of the item and confirm that, yes, it has expired. That is where we now have the authority to confiscate those items and even sanction whoever the promoter of the business is,” Akintola told PUNCH Healthwise.

Akintola insisted that NAFDAC remains active in combating unwholesome and counterfeit products across Nigeria, stating that the agency had, at the beginning of the year, confiscated fake and expired goods worth over a trillion naira.

“That’s part of what we do. It’s our core mandate. We do it every day,” he said.

He, however, admitted that monitoring every retail outlet in a country as vast and populous as Nigeria remains a logistical challenge.

He added, “It is not possible for NAFDAC to know all the shops. You can imagine, just try to guess the number of such stores we have in Lagos alone, let alone across the country.

“So, to help us and help the populace, when you see such things, alert the nearest office to you. Then you wait to see whether we react or not.”

Akintola assured that once a formal complaint is lodged and verified, NAFDAC enforcement teams would act immediately.

He stressed, “The items will be seized and destroyed, and whoever is behind it, the merchant will be arrested. That is what we do, and we do it on a regular basis.”

Safety Commission to probe supermarkets

The Lagos State Safety Commission told PUNCH Healthwise that it will commence investigations into the sale of expired and nearly expired products in supermarkets across the state.

The Commission’s Director of Public Affairs, Adewunmi Okoh, who spoke with our correspondent, said the agency would escalate the issues to the relevant department.

“We have a unit that is in charge of monitoring supermarkets and SPAs. They usually carry out routine checks, and we will task them with looking into this particular matter,” she said.

Okoh assured that the commission would take appropriate action after conducting its investigations, adding that the findings would be shared in due course.

“We appreciate the discovery and the eye-opener. Our team will reach out to the affected stores, and we will get back to you on their findings,” she said.

While acknowledging the urgency of the matter, Okoh noted that operations may be slightly delayed due to the ongoing public holiday, but promised that the investigation would resume the following week.

Exposed! Lagos supermarkets selling expired groceries to shoppers,"Some Lagos supermarkets are selling expired groceries and edibles under the guise of ‘promotional offers’, deceiving unsuspecting shoppers. With regulatory bodies like the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control and the Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency turning a blind eye, PUNCH Healthwise investigates the rising trend of food fraud and life-threatening risks hidden behind discount stickers and flashy promo signs. SODIQ OJUROUNGBE reports.

On a Saturday morning, Daniel Olanrewaju set out to make the weekend a memorable one for his children. The plan was just to make a delicious plate of fried yams, served hot with ketchup as a weekend treat for his three young kids. Olanrewaju made a quick dash to a popular supermarket in the Ikeja area of Lagos, picked up a bottle of ketchup from the ‘promo’ shelf, and returned home without a second thought.

Back in the kitchen, the oil sizzled, and the fried yams browned to perfection. Everything was going according to plan.

Unknown to Olanrewaju, the ketchup he had purchased from the supermarket had expired three weeks earlier. As soon as one of his sons tasted the ketchup, he spat it out, complaining of the bad taste.

Olanrewaju thought it was just his son’s way of trying to get out of eating, but little did he know that his other two children would soon fall victim to the expired product.

About an hour after the two other children devoured the ketchup-laden fried yams, one of them started complaining of a stomach ache.

Alarmed, Olanrewaju decided to taste the ketchup himself, and what he discovered was horrifying.

“The taste was horrible. Sour, strange, almost fermented. That was when I checked the label and saw the expiry date. The product had expired more than three weeks before I bought it.

“It took medical intervention to take care of my child, who had eaten a lot of the expired ketchup. I was devastated, and I couldn’t believe that a simple trip to the supermarket could turn into a health crisis,” Olanrewaju recounted in an interview with PUNCH Healthwise.

Olanrewaju further revealed that this was not the first time he had bought expired groceries from a supermarket, only to discover later that they were expired.

“Before, I always thought maybe stores and supermarkets do promo because a product is not selling, but over time, I realised that they are only trying to push out expired and about-to-expire products on their shelves without proper explicit explanation for the customer to know,” he said.

“They will just sell it to you, and it’s only when you are observant or notice certain changes that you will check it and realise the product has expired. I have been a victim more than three times, and with my recent experience, I have vowed never to buy goods displayed on promo again,” he stated.

Expired pringles

For Temitope Ogunsanya, the memory still lingers, not because of any physical reaction but because of the lingering sense of betrayal. It was supposed to be a simple, thoughtful gesture.

His wife had casually mentioned craving something crunchy, and he figured a pack of the ever-popular Pringles would do the trick.

Array

So, on a Tuesday afternoon, he stopped by Jodjo Supermarket, a known retail outlet tucked along the busy stretch of Ijegun Road in Lagos. The store, always bustling with foot traffic and lined with discount signs, was running a “Buy One, Get One 50% Off” promo on snacks. Ogunsanya, like most Lagosians trying to stretch every naira, jumped at the offer.

He recalled, “There were all sorts of items stacked on the promo shelf, including chocolates, biscuits, and soft drinks. I picked two packs of Pringles. Everything looked normal. I didn’t even think of checking the expiration date. Why would I? It is a big supermarket.”

Ogunsanya took the cans home, and he and his wife opened one that night while watching a movie. The taste didn’t seem off, not obviously, and there were no initial side effects.

It wasn’t until the next day, while tossing the empty can into the dustbin, that Ogunsanya noticed that the expiry date was over a month old.

“I froze! I called my wife immediately, and she laughed it off, but I didn’t find it funny. What if it were something more perishable? What if it had affected her or made her sick?” he told PUNCH Healthwise, shaking his head.

Although he and his wife escaped unscathed, the incident left a bitter aftertaste.

He added, “I used to believe that big supermarkets were more reliable. But now, I look at them with suspicion. The trust is gone.

“Since that day, I don’t just check the expiry date; I double-check it. Sometimes, I even put the item back if I feel the date is too close.”

Pattern of deceit

Stories like that of Olanrewaju and Ogunsanya are becoming disturbingly common. Their experiences suggest that this isn’t just a case of occasional lapses in quality control but part of a systemic manipulation of consumer trust.

Findings by PUNCH Healthwise reveal a troubling trend that has led to a rise in the sale of expired or near-expiry products, driven by a calculated pattern of retail deceit playing out across supermarkets in Lagos.

Behind the brightly coloured promo tags and carefully worded sales pitches lies a deliberate effort to exploit consumer trust and offload questionable stock.

To uncover the pattern of deceit that is widespread across Lagos supermarkets, our correspondent, posing as a customer, visited several supermarkets in different parts of the metropolis and was shocked to discover expired products on their shelves.

Array

In some cases, the products had expired months ago, while others were mere days away from their expiration dates.

From Ogba to Ishaga, Ijegun to Victoria Island, and down to Lekki, PUNCH Healthwise discovered a growing strategy used by many supermarkets. Products nearing, or already past, their expiration dates are quietly removed from regular shelves and repackaged under labels like ‘promotions’ or ‘flash sales’.

It was observed that prices are slashed, signs scream urgency, and unsuspecting shoppers, thinking they have found a bargain, walk away with products that should never have been sold in the first place.

These deceptive sales tactics rely on psychological tricks like urgency, scarcity, and the illusion of savings. They thrive on the economic reality that many Nigerians, struggling with inflation and rising living costs, often don’t check expiry labels, too focused on stretching their money as far as it will go.

Dangerous trend hidden in plain sight

Beyond the personal testimonies of shoppers who unknowingly bought expired food items disguised as discounted deals, PUNCH Healthwise launched an undercover investigation to uncover the widespread retail deceit.

Between August 25 and September 4, 2025, our correspondent visited more than eight supermarkets across different local government areas in Lagos State. These included stores in highbrow neighbourhoods like Lekki and middle-income areas such as Ishaga, Ogba, and Abule-Egba.

Array

At Renne Supermarket in Lekki Phase 1, visited on August 25, several items displayed prominently in the promo section were found to be expired or just days away from expiration.

A premium coffee product, Chicco D’Oro, had already expired, while another brand, Bristol Decaf, was only two days from its expiry date at the time of purchase.

Despite their expired or near-expired status, the price slash was dramatic and almost unbelievable. The Chicco D’Oro, once sold for N9,800, was reduced to N500. Similarly, Bristol Decaf, originally priced at N7,000, was also sold for N500.

Other items on the shelf followed the same pattern, with Cadbury Snack Shortcake (140g), initially N7,600, which was reduced to N3,000, while a 500g pack of Jacob Kronug dropped from N15,500 to N9,900. Shoppers browsing the aisles, unaware or perhaps too trusting, reached for these deals without hesitation — never suspecting the risk attached.

Array

On August 29, our correspondent visited Medzie Supermarket in Abule-Egba. There, items like White Dats and Pune Cocoa remained openly displayed on the shelves, despite having expired over two weeks earlier, on August 12 and 13, respectively.

No warnings were placed on the products, and they were not removed from the racks. In fact, they were among the more visibly highlighted “special offers” in the store.

Three days later, on September 3, our correspondent visited Evabest Supermarket in Iju-Ishaga, where the situation was just as troubling. Four items purchased from the store, including tomato ketchup, Dano canned milk, Oral-B toothpaste and Ovaltine, were discovered to have expired. The tomato ketchup had been out of date since April 14, 2025. The Dano and Ovaltine products expired on August 12, while the Oral-B expired in July 2025. Yet all of these were still being sold as part of ongoing promotional deals.

That same day, at So Rite Supermarket in Ishaga, our correspondent purchased a pack of digestive biscuits prominently displayed on the promo shelf. Upon checking, the biscuit was set to expire by September 13, just less than 10 days away. Another item, Ovaltine, also on flash sale, had less than ten days left before its expiration date of September 12. None of these products had any markings to indicate their near-expiry status. There were no disclaimers, no staff warnings, only the discount sticker.

Array

The following day, September 4, PUNCH Healthwise visited Market Square Supermarket, also in Lekki Phase 1. There, a bottle of Schweppes, previously sold for N515, was now offered at just N150. It was set to expire the very next day, September 5. Another product, a bottle of tomato ketchup, which had been retailing for N3,375 was slashed to N700, and would expire within ten days, by September 13.

The trend continued with a carbonated drink from the brand Rubicon, whose label simply read “September 2025” with no specific expiry date. This lack of detail raises serious concerns, especially considering that many other items on the shelf bore similarly vague expiration markings — stating only the month and year, but omitting the exact day.

Array

Across all these visits, the same pattern repeated itself. Products that were expired or dangerously close to expiration were removed from standard shelves, relabeled as “promo items,” and heavily discounted.

Our correspondent observed that there were no warnings provided. The discount signs were colourful and persuasive, drawing customers in with the illusion of a good deal — when in fact, they were being sold what could very well be expired poison.

PUNCH Healthwise’s findings suggest that this is not a series of isolated incidents or oversights but a calculated and coordinated retail tactic that depends on the hope that buyers are either too distracted, too trusting, or too desperate for bargains to check expiration dates.

For many unsuspecting customers, these discounted products appear to be a lucky bargain, especially in today’s harsh economic climate. Unaware that the items are already expired or just days from expiration, they purchase them in bulk, stock them at home, and continue consuming them over the course of weeks or even months. In doing so, they unknowingly put their health, and in some cases, their lives, at serious risk.

A sales representative at one of the popular supermarkets in Lagos, who spoke with PUNCH Healthwise on the condition of anonymity, revealed that the practice of hiding expired or nearly expired items under the guise of promotional sales is not an isolated act, adding that it is a well-known and routine strategy across many retail outlets in the state.

According to her, the moment a product is close to its expiration date, sometimes just days away, management typically instructs staff to move such items to the promo shelf, rather than discard or clearly label them as near-expiry.

She said, “To be honest, it’s normal in many stores. Once an item is getting close to the expiry date, instead of removing it from circulation, we are told to put it on promo. We reduce the price and make it look like a special offer. Most customers don’t bother checking the date — they just see the discount and rush it.”

She further explained that staff members are often discouraged from pointing out expiry concerns to customers unless specifically asked.

In some cases, she alleged, price stickers are deliberately placed over the expiry dates to obscure them from view.

“It is not every staff member who is comfortable with it, but we don’t really have a choice. If you talk too much, you can lose your job. And some store managers are even worse — they know it’s wrong, but they still encourage it because they don’t want to waste stock,” she added.

Clear violation

Despite NAFDAC’s clear and comprehensive guidelines on how expired and unwholesome products should be handled, none of the supermarkets visited during the PUNCH Healthwise investigation showed any visible signs of compliance.

According to NAFDAC’s official Guidelines for the Handling and Disposal of Unwholesome Medicines and Regulated Products, food items and other consumables deemed unwholesome, including expired goods, must not be sold, redistributed, or disguised as fit for consumption under any circumstances.

The guidelines document obtained by PUNCH Healthwise from NAFDAC’s website stated that all establishments dealing in food, medicine, cosmetics, or any regulated product are mandated to set aside a clearly demarcated area for storing expired or unwholesome goods.

“Demarcate an area for storing expired/unwholesome medicines and NAFDAC-regulated products which shall be labelled conspicuously with the words ‘Expired Products’, ‘Not for Sale’, or in red ink,” a part of the guidelines read.

But in every store visited by our correspondent, there were no such designated areas. Expired products were not quarantined, not labelled, and not separated from items meant for sale.

In fact, they were placed on promotional shelves right next to active, non-expired goods, often disguised with aggressive price slashes and attention-grabbing signage.

There were no warning labels, no signs indicating “Near Expiry”, and certainly no restricted zones for expired stock. What should have been flagged for disposal or regulatory verification was instead packaged as a bargain, ready to be picked up by any unsuspecting shopper walking through the aisles.

The Counterfeit and Fake Drugs and Unwholesome Processed Foods (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act Cap C.34, LFN 2004, also leaves no room for interpretation.

Section 1 of the Act criminalises the manufacture, sale, and distribution of counterfeit or fake drugs and unwholesome processed food, declaring such practices punishable by imprisonment without the option of a fine upon conviction.

It further empowers law enforcement and regulatory agencies to seize, confiscate, and prosecute those in possession of expired or harmful consumables being sold for human use.

According to the Act, selling unwholesome products attracts penalties including a fine worth N500,000 or imprisonment of not less than five years.

The actions observed in Lagos supermarkets visited by PUNCH Healthwise clearly fall within this legal definition.

Legislation lapses

Legal experts argue that even supermarkets claiming ignorance cannot be absolved of liability, noting that the Act holds both individuals and corporate entities accountable, including owners, managers, and staff who facilitate or fail to report such sales.

A consumer protection lawyer based in Lagos, Barr. Tayo Ogunlana, expressed concerns that despite multiple violations across various stores and chains, there is little evidence of widespread crackdowns, penalties, or closures.

He lamented that regulatory bodies appear reactive rather than proactive, stepping in only when complaints become too loud to ignore.

He stressed, “Let’s be clear: any supermarket or store selling expired goods is committing a punishable offence under Nigerian law.

“It doesn’t matter whether someone got sick or not. The very act of offering expired products for sale is grounds for prosecution.

“How many times have you seen any supermarket shut down for selling expired goods?

“You might see small vendors being harassed, but the big stores? They get a slap on the wrist, if anything at all.”

NAFDAC’s silent watch

Despite being statutorily empowered to ensure that all consumable goods in Nigeria meet safety standards both before and after they enter the market, findings by PUNCH Healthwise show the absence of visible regulatory intervention by NAFDAC, particularly in Lagos supermarkets, where expired and unwholesome food products are being sold openly.

A food policy researcher, Mariam Kuranga, expressed deep concern over the agency’s apparent inaction, describing NAFDAC as “a toothless dog that has failed to effectively police the activities of many big-name retail outlets operating across Nigeria.”

“In reality, NAFDAC seems more invested in raiding sachet water factories in remote towns than tackling the real danger, high-end supermarkets in Lekki and other urban areas that are knowingly selling expired food items. Their silence is fuelling this crime,” she told PUNCH Healthwise.

Kuranga added that expired products are just one part of the problem.

According to her, some of these retail chains are also guilty of stocking unregistered or foreign-imported products without NAFDAC approval.

She added, “Walk into some of these stores, and you will find imported drinks, cereals, and snacks that bear no NAFDAC registration number. Some don’t even carry proper labelling, yet they’re sold daily in full view of the public. Where is NAFDAC? Who is monitoring this?”

On the need for clear demarcation and labelling of near-expiry products, Kuranga said many stores deliberately blur the lines between what is safe for consumption and what is not, misleading consumers, especially those shopping in a hurry or unaware of food safety guidelines.

“It is completely unethical to display a product that will expire in less than two weeks right next to fresh stock, without any warning label,” she said.

She stressed that products approaching expiration must not only be separated but also clearly marked, as stipulated by NAFDAC guidelines.

She maintained, “Anything less than that is fraud. And when someone falls sick or worse, it becomes a public health risk. These supermarkets are playing with lives.”

Kuranga called on NAFDAC to go beyond press releases and workshops and to begin conducting random compliance checks in major retail chains, not just informal markets.

She stressed, “If they can deploy task forces to hunt down fake malaria drugs in the North, then they can certainly inspect the so-called elite supermarkets poisoning Lagos families with expired ketchup and canned milk.”

Lurking danger

Food experts warned that consuming expired food could lead to food poisoning, which can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and fever.

While noting that the expiration date is based on scientific testing, determining when the food item is at its safest and freshest, the experts stressed that consuming expired foods is a risk that should not be taken lightly.

A nutritionist/dietitian, Odunayo Sunday, explained that consuming food past expiration dates increases the likelihood of harmful bacteria growth, toxin formation, and nutrient degradation.

She said, “Expiration dates are not arbitrary. They indicate the point beyond which the quality and safety of the product can no longer be guaranteed. Consuming food past this date increases the likelihood of harmful bacteria growth, toxin formation, and nutrient degradation.”

Beyond immediate food poisoning, the food expert added that prolonged consumption of expired products can lead to more severe health consequences, especially for vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.

According to her, chronic exposure to spoiled or contaminated foods may result in digestive disorders, allergic reactions, and, in some cases, long-term organ damage.

She pointed out that certain foods, like dairy, meat, and seafood, pose higher risks when expired compared to dry goods or canned items, which may sometimes retain quality beyond their printed dates if stored properly.

She urged consumers to always check expiration dates carefully and to avoid being swayed by attractive promotional offers on products that are nearing or past their expiry.

The nutritionist also called on regulatory agencies to intensify surveillance and enforcement efforts in supermarkets and markets across Lagos to curb the sale of expired foods.

A food quality assurance officer, Mr Immanuel Basil, told one of our correspondents that the expiry dates of consumer goods are directly related to their quality.

He added, “Expiry dates are very crucial in the production of Fast Moving Consumer Goods. As a matter of fact, it’s one of the elements of quality consumer goods. It’s also not news that some FMCGs make lots of mistakes with expiry dates.

“This is seen when their products on counters or in distribution begin to deteriorate even before the quoted expiry dates. So, the calculation of expiry dates is very pivotal to quality.

“This is especially true because these goods have or could have several different components that go into the production, blending and can react with each other in one way or the other to give a different outcome than expected.

“The packaging material, storage conditions and handling of the products in transit also play a role in all of these.”

Basil noted that the quality of products would deteriorate before their expiry dates, and consuming such could have serious health implications.

“Expiry dates are very important and flouting them could be injurious to health. I will recommend that consumers be careful with products. Products can go off before the expiry date, so it’s important to be mindful and flag off any cases to the company’s customer care for corrections and retrieval of batches already in distribution.

“The major implications of consuming expired products range from mild to severe stomach upset, allergies, and, in rare cases, death, and a bad experience with these products,” he added.

Not our usual business practice — Rennie Supermarket reacts

A director of Rennie Supermarket, simply identified as Christian, apologised following our correspondent’s discovery of an expired product on the shelves of one of its outlets.

In an exclusive conversation with our correspondent, Christian admitted that the presence of the expired item was a serious breach of standard procedure and assured the public that the supermarket does not intentionally sell expired goods.

“We are not allowed to sell expired products, and there is a clear protocol in place to handle such items. This is not in line with our business practice,” he said.

Christian expressed concern over the lapse and said an internal investigation was already underway to determine how the expired product bypassed the store’s quality control mechanisms.

He added, “If the product is expired, I would need to work with my internal team to find out how it ended up on the shelf. We have been in business for many years, and this is not what we stand for.”

He acknowledged that the supermarket has dedicated staff tasked with identifying and removing expired products and disclosed that the supermarket works closely with government regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with food safety standards.

“We have almost three staff members whose job is to handle expired items alone. So if something went wrong, it is clearly a human error. We’ll work on it,” Christian said.

According to him, the supermarket follows the Nigerian government’s guidelines, which stipulate that items nearing expiration must be clearly marked and sold at a reduced price to encourage quick purchase before they expire.

“No matter what, if a product is about to expire, we should indicate that and reduce the price before it gets to that point. That is the guideline,” he said.

Christian extended an apology on behalf of the supermarket to our correspondent and other patrons who may have had similar experiences.

“We are sorry for your bad experience. It is not our intention to be selling expired products and feeding people unsafe items. That’s not what we do here,” he said.

He promised that the supermarket would improve its internal checks and ensure expiry dates are prominently displayed alongside price reductions in the future.

So Rite Supermarket promises disciplinary action, audit

The management of So Rite Supermarket promised an immediate internal investigation to verify the claims made by our correspondent.

An auditor with the retail chain, Joseph Etim, who spoke with PUNCH Healthwise, revealed that the supermarket will take disciplinary action where necessary following concerns raised about product shelf-life monitoring at the outlet visited during the investigation.

While reiterating the outlet’s commitment to consumer safety, Etim stressed that the company has “zero tolerance” for expired or near-expiry goods being sold to customers.

According to him, the Managing Director of the company, who is currently out of the country, was informed of the situation and had mandated a full audit of the outlet involved.

“We take the issue of product expiration very seriously as a company. It is against our policy to display or sell expired items,” he stated.

Etim explained that the company operates a dedicated shelf for goods nearing expiry, which are to be clearly marked and disclosed to customers.

He added that the failure to follow these protocols by staff our correspondent met at the outlet constitutes a breach of internal procedure and would be addressed.

“If any staff failed to inform customers or wrongly displayed products, disciplinary measures will be taken. The branch manager will be held accountable for any deviation from company policy,” he said.

While noting that the company awaits further details to support the ongoing investigation, Etim maintained that routine checks by regulatory bodies such as the Standards Organisation of Nigeria and the Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency have not uncovered any violations in the past.

“Our outlets are regularly inspected by government agencies, and we’ve always maintained a clean record. This incident, however, is being treated with urgency,” he stated.

The So Rite Supermarket auditor assured its customers of its continued commitment to quality control, compliance with regulations, and consumer health standards.

Others decline comments

Efforts by PUNCH Healthwise to get reactions from other supermarkets involved proved abortive.

Our correspondent reached out to the outlets using the contact numbers printed on the receipts obtained during the visits. However, the lines were either unreachable or not connecting.

Messages sent via WhatsApp and SMS were not responded to as of the time this report was filed.

We can’t be everywhere – NAFDAC

Array

When contacted, the Resident Media Consultant to NAFDAC, Sayo Akintola, acknowledged the gravity of the situation but stressed the agency’s dependence on public cooperation for swift intervention.

“Like we always tell people, when you see something like this, we have our offices across the country, including Abuja. What we expect from you is to get evidence, probably the expired item, then notify our office.

“You have indirectly done that now, at least by calling me. But the missing leg of it is the physical evidence. We have to get hold of the item and confirm that, yes, it has expired. That is where we now have the authority to confiscate those items and even sanction whoever the promoter of the business is,” Akintola told PUNCH Healthwise.

Akintola insisted that NAFDAC remains active in combating unwholesome and counterfeit products across Nigeria, stating that the agency had, at the beginning of the year, confiscated fake and expired goods worth over a trillion naira.

“That’s part of what we do. It’s our core mandate. We do it every day,” he said.

He, however, admitted that monitoring every retail outlet in a country as vast and populous as Nigeria remains a logistical challenge.

He added, “It is not possible for NAFDAC to know all the shops. You can imagine, just try to guess the number of such stores we have in Lagos alone, let alone across the country.

“So, to help us and help the populace, when you see such things, alert the nearest office to you. Then you wait to see whether we react or not.”

Akintola assured that once a formal complaint is lodged and verified, NAFDAC enforcement teams would act immediately.

He stressed, “The items will be seized and destroyed, and whoever is behind it, the merchant will be arrested. That is what we do, and we do it on a regular basis.”

Safety Commission to probe supermarkets

The Lagos State Safety Commission told PUNCH Healthwise that it will commence investigations into the sale of expired and nearly expired products in supermarkets across the state.

The Commission’s Director of Public Affairs, Adewunmi Okoh, who spoke with our correspondent, said the agency would escalate the issues to the relevant department.

“We have a unit that is in charge of monitoring supermarkets and SPAs. They usually carry out routine checks, and we will task them with looking into this particular matter,” she said.

Okoh assured that the commission would take appropriate action after conducting its investigations, adding that the findings would be shared in due course.

“We appreciate the discovery and the eye-opener. Our team will reach out to the affected stores, and we will get back to you on their findings,” she said.

While acknowledging the urgency of the matter, Okoh noted that operations may be slightly delayed due to the ongoing public holiday, but promised that the investigation would resume the following week.

"Umuada: How Igbo land’s powerful sisterhood terrifies women, silences men (II)","Godfrey George

Despite its peacekeeping mission and role as a custodian of culture, rights advocates have called for the sensitisation of Umuada leaders against upholding patriarchal norms and being at the forefront of woman-to-woman violence, as evident in widowhood practices and the excessive use of force as a means of control, writes GODFREY GEORGE in this second part of a two-part series

Between fear and pride

For some, the Umuada remain nothing short of lionesses, unyielding guardians of justice and cultural order.

In his recollection, a Facebook user, Chijioke Okoli, spoke with pride about his maternal home, where the Umuada reigned as a formidable force.

“They are lionesses who are strong in wealth and activities,” he said, describing women with nicknames like Oche Eze Nwanyi, Lady Gold, Ada eji eje mba, and Egodimma. His late mother, once the Secretary-General, was known as Lady Bomber or China Umu Agbala.

“I dare say the Umunnas listen to them. They are the pillars and shakers of the father’s land. Among them are former and present commissioners, retired permanent secretaries, lecturers, and top businesswomen who are billionaires in their own right.”

Okoli remembered a burial where the Umuada turned grief into reckoning.

The deceased, an elderly woman, had allegedly died of neglect at the hands of her children.

“Early that morning, before the clergy could begin, the women gathered, wielding firewood. They demanded that the children bring out the ‘meat’ they had killed, so they could roast and eat. Wearing gloves and nose masks, they sang songs, calling the children murderers. The burial could not be held. Not even the priest nor the Umunnas could stop them.”

It was not a mere spectacle. It was an indictment, a cultural trial. For hours, the children knelt, begging for forgiveness before the burial was allowed to proceed.

“If there is one thing I am proud of in my maternal home,” Okoli added, “it is these powerful women. My mom would be so proud of them.”

Others echo this reverence. Another Facebook user, Prince Jonathan Chuks, remembered how, as a boy, the Umuada intervened in the home of a neighbour notorious for battering his wife.

“One very early morning, before the man could wake up, they all gathered in his compound with a cane. The beating that man received that day from his bed brought back some sense into him. That incident ended the fights in that household to date.”

For him, such interventions proved the Umuada were indispensable. He added, “This circle should never be abolished because they are really doing an amazing thing to see that society gets better.”

But where Okoli and Chuks saw heroism, others remembered only the chaos.

Asadu Chinelo recalled her grandmother’s burial, when the Umuada insisted on a goat at 1 am.

“The kind kata kata (hassle) that unfolded before a goat was brought that night was indescribable. It was war. My aunties cried.”

Okoli, responding to her, explained: “They strike usually when something is going wrong. Their demands are a way of stifling people who may want to claim to be above traditions.”

For Alex Chuks, the memory of his grandfather’s burial is coloured by humiliation.

“These women came with chaos that night, demanding all of the cow heads (isi ewu). Nobody said a word. Even my dad was mute. I can’t forget that day.”

Others have learned to tread carefully. An actor, Cyriacus Ozoemena, remembered his mother’s burial as a seamless experience only because he obeyed her dying counsel: to respect the Umuada and meet their demands without hesitation.

“They even pitied me as the only son not to do certain things, but I told them that I loved my mom so much and if there’s anything needed, they should let me know, and I would find a way. The burial was a success.”

For Ozoemena, their presence was not a threat but a shield. The highlight of the day, he recalled, was when he and his sister were called upon to dance for their mother. The Umuada showered them with money, sealing the day with their approval.

Across testimonies, one thing is clear: whether feared or celebrated, the Umuada still wield a power that bends families. Their authority provokes admiration in some and resentment in others, but never indifference.

In defence of Umuada

Controversy has recently shadowed the Umuada, yet to understand their authority and recent public actions, it is important first to listen to how they describe themselves and the work they do.

At the Lagos branch of the Umuada Igbo Organisation, the group’s own statement underscores this purpose.

As the branch note reads, “The crest also carries the inscription Umuada Nma Nma, a phrase that loosely translates as ‘daughters of beauty,’ underscoring the pride and identity that members attach to their collective heritage.”

The statement continues, “The organisation’s stated mission is to foster peace and unity among Igbo women everywhere, and to invest time, efforts, and resources into initiatives that benefit its members.

“It also commits to promoting Igbo culture, values, and traditions, pledging to safeguard, uphold, and enhance these within wider society. Another part of its stated mandate is the encouragement and promotion of family values, which it identifies as the bedrock of a stable community.”

Such words matter. They place the Umuada within a framework of cultural stewardship, mutual support, and public service. They describe a network that sees its role as preserving identity, strengthening family ties, and creating platforms for mentorship, education, and empowerment.

The organisation’s own vision and objectives make the case explicit.

Senior Lecturer, Department of Political Science, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Dr Ugwueze Ikechukwu

In a May 18, 2025, post, Agbaranwanyi Ngozika Nneochie wrote of a meeting that “has been made yet another remarkable day in the history of Ogbako Umuada Odinana Igbo Cultural Association” and announced an engagement with HRH Omu Onyebuchie Okonkwo that “has again opened another door of opportunity for the accomplishment and realisation of the vision of this organisation.”

She went on to list the association’s aims: “To promote the true Odinana woman; to make the world know about the Igbo traditional woman; to bring back the true power of womanhood in Odinana Igbo; to bring back the sidelined traditions in Igbo land; to empower the Igbo girl child to be independent.”

At the Mbaise branch of the Umuada society, two of its executives expressed frustration over what they described as “growing misconceptions” about the role of the group in Igbo communities.

One of the women, who declined to give her name, insisted that the Umuada remain the moral compass and custodians of Igbo tradition.

“You don’t disobey nature. We are nature. We are the mothers,” she declared, her voice firm. “If we say, ‘do this,’ we know what we are saying. We are custodians of tradition. If we allow you people to do as you like, things will spoil in Igbo land.”

For her, the society’s role is not merely symbolic but deeply practical, ensuring that families and communities do not deviate from long-established norms. She described this oversight as both a responsibility and a sacred calling.

Another executive, who introduced herself simply as Mrs Chinwe, offered more pointed examples.

According to the woman, who is also a chief, Umuada in Mbaise often intervene in disputes between young wives and their in-laws.

“How can a young girl who is married into our community be maltreating her mother-in-law? It’s not done, na,” she said. “We will send her packing. We will teach her a lesson. Even the police know that this one is a family affair.”

She narrated a recent incident that, to her, underscored why the Umuada cannot relent.

“The other day, I learnt that a woman was caught in adultery. That is an abomination. It is like you want us to pamper this generation. This is tradition,” she said, shaking her head. “We have even soft-pedalled on a lot of things. It’s what is keeping Igbo society together.”

Why Umuada are respected in Igbo land – Ohanaeze

The weight of the Umuada institution in Igboland is not in doubt, a fact underscored by cultural leaders who continue to hold them in reverence despite the sometimes controversial methods of enforcing their authority.

A titled chief and former spokesperson for the foremost Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Dr Alex Ogbonnia, described the group as “peacemakers” who preach truth and love in their families, and whose impartiality has earned them deep respect across generations.

“They are also character moulders in various ways,” Ogbonnia explained. “Because they maintain a strong emotional attachment to their maiden families, each time the community gathers for any occasion, the Umuada are given a special role to play. If you kill a cow, from the lower limb down is given to the Umuada.”

That authority, he stressed, extends beyond symbolic gestures into the practical management of community affairs. Whether at marriages, funerals, or disputes, the Umuada’s stance is decisive.

“They also have their interventionist role, so when there is chaos, whatever stance they take is always respected. It’s a formidable and coordinated institution that cannot be bought with money, and no one can defy the authority of the Umuada as it is in Igboland today,” Ogbonnia said.

He admitted that modernity has altered their operations but has not eroded their influence.

The biggest change, he noted, lies in issues of distance and intermarriage. Many women now live far from their maiden homes and cannot attend to family matters as regularly as before.

Ogbonnia, a lecturer of Political Science at Godfrey Okoye University, argued that it was always wiser to avoid provoking the Umuada and instead, honour the traditions they uphold. For him, their role mirrors “the female psychology.”

This sometimes creates tension between their actions and formal law.

“Many things they are doing now are not all that are within the purview of the law, but inasmuch as they are against the law, they are customary. They are the customs of the community. That is where the customs of the community and law run contrary to each other,” Ogbonnia observed.

For a Senior Lecturer of Political Science at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Dr Ugwueze Ikechukwu, what is often described as the “women’s government” in Igboland is no trivial matter.

In his words, it is “a very serious and unbreakable government.” His advice to men is simple: “The best thing for us, men, is to run away, because it is the best strategy available. The story will not be the same if it were men doing such a thing or if men were involved in such acts. But when it’s women-to-women, it is women’s business.”

To buttress his point, he recalled a case from a neighbouring village where a wife was accused of maltreating her husband.

“It was the village women, in one of their monthly meetings early in the morning, that moved in a group and insisted that the abusive wife must go. In fact, the husband didn’t resist because it was like helping him. This was women-to-women,” he said.

For him, such an episode demonstrated the force of female solidarity. “Women know themselves, and so their government is always very strong and unbreakable. If you interfere, you may end up returning home to worse calamity.”

While conceding that excesses exist, Ugwueze insisted that the Umuada seldom act without due process.

“People overdo things sometimes, but what I find difficult about navigating a terrain of this nature is that nothing goes for nothing. There cannot be smoke without fire.

As far as I know, the Umuada society is not one where decisions are taken without following due process and follow-up for a reasonable period of time. We know that some might be unlucky to be perceived the way they are not. But, in most cases, their judgment is always as it is, if not near-perfect.”

He was particularly critical of widowhood rites, calling them a violation of natural justice. “If you are not living in your village, you should know what is going on. What I have a problem with is the widowhood rites, where people shave their hair and drink the water used in bathing the corpse. It has been an age-long practice amongst these people, but it is against the laws of natural justice and fairness,” he concluded.

Seek redress – FIDA

For the spokesperson of the International Federation of Women Lawyers, Mrs Philomena Neji, the influence of the Umuada has waned compared to what it once was.

“I don’t think it’s still as much as it used to be. I may be wrong. Over the years in Igboland, they usually come up more in some traditional setups, like when women lose their husbands or during traditional marriages. There is always a space where their attention is needed.

For me, just like the issue of patriarchy, all these things are given space, but it’s no longer how it used to be,” she explained.

Neji noted that in the past, the Umuada’s demands were much more rigid. “They used to insist, for instance, that a woman shave her hair when she lost her husband. But it is no longer business as usual,” she said.

According to her, such practices now face increasing pushback under the law.

“For FIDA, things like that are not allowed because, when reported, the law will always take its course. We have the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act, and we have been clamouring for it to be domesticated in several states of the federation. It’s not always enough that we have laws, but effective implementation is key.”

On the broader question of culture and rights, Neji was clear: “Of course, we know that culture is inevitable. At the same time, any culture that is repugnant to good conscience, equity and fairness, we clamour for that to be expunged.”

She urged people to step forward with complaints when cultural demands crossed into abuse.

“Everything is based on evidence. People should report these cases so they can be taken up,” she added.

Life Bencher and former Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Prof. Joy Ngozi Ezeilo (SAN), traced the Umuada institution to its deep cultural roots.

According to her, these women were entrusted as custodians of tradition in Igbo communities, but that responsibility has often been stretched to troubling ends.

“It becomes problematic when that power is used to perpetrate gender-based violence, especially against women. It requires a lot of sensitisation, and we have been doing that as Igbo women,” she explained.

Ezeilo described the dynamic as a form of “bargaining patriarchy.”

“In this system, women feel important all of a sudden, and this importance conferred on them by men is used as an instrumentality to reinforce social norms, sex stereotypes, and gender-based violence and discrimination against women. These are part of the system, and they don’t even see it,” she said.

To her, the internalisation of gender roles lies at the heart of the matter. “They have internalised their being as the other sex and their role as custodians of maintaining the culture of the family that they are originally from.

The concept of Umuada is that it is in your parents’ house that you are an Umuada or Nwa Ada. When you are Nwa Ada, you feel you have certain privileges, and they are respected. So, they use that to maintain whatever they see as the culture and follow it to the letter.”

She argued that cultural attachment alone cannot justify harmful practices.

“We need a transformation of social norms and an emphasis on eliminating gender-based violence. We need to continue engaging with the Umuada as cultural leaders.

Gender-based violence or violence against women and girls, under whatever guise, be it cultural practices or tradition, is flawed. It is against international and regional treaties, most of which Nigeria is a signatory to,” the professor of law added.

Courts, Ezeilo noted, have repeatedly struck down some of Umuada’s actions.

“Many courts have pronounced some of these acts by the Umuada as illegal. Education is what is required. There is a precinct ecology upon which the Umuada ecology is founded. So, you have to really engage with them, with traditional rulers, and with the men who gave the women these powers.”

She recalled incidents that exposed the severity of their authority.

“There was a burial of a popular activist of blessed memory, where, because the widow refused to shave her hair, the Umuada refused to eat, and they moved out. This was to nullify the burial. It was a big impasse with regard to the continuation of the funeral.

That is the way they do these things. Somewhere in Anambra, there is a case. The Umuada preside over any case in their families. And even non-Igbos are affected. Imagine insisting that a woman must stay overnight with the corpse of her husband because ‘it is tradition’.”

For her, such practices should no longer stand unquestioned.

“What the Umuada do must be in accordance with the law. Ignorance of the law is not an excuse. This is violence perpetrated against women by fellow women,” the don added.

Sensitisation needed

Ezeilo, who was a United Nations Special Rapporteur and founder of Women Aids Collective (widely known as WACOL), stressed that the Umuada system could not be detached from the broader structures of patriarchy that created it.

“This is to tell you that men are implicated. The men act like they are not in charge. Fines are imposed, and these women, if they refuse to pay, are ostracised from their communities,” she noted.

For her, the solution lies in rights-based engagement.

“Fundamental human rights must be respected. That is why we have to engage in sensitisation and dialogue. We need vanguards who will stand as watchdogs. And a woman who sits in that honourable position.”

Resistance to the Umuada, she explained, already exists in some spaces.

“Some religious groups are resisting them. Some have won, some have not. Some matters have gone to court, and there have been a lot of victories.

“The court will always uphold fundamental human rights. Some practices have even been criticised by the Supreme Court, such as in Ukeje v. Ukeje, where it was upheld that women can now inherit properties left by deceased relatives.”

For Ezeilo, the path forward is clear: “It starts with sensitisation and ends with action.”

"Umuada: How Igbo land’s powerful sisterhood terrifies women, silences men (II)","Godfrey George

Despite its peacekeeping mission and role as a custodian of culture, rights advocates have called for the sensitisation of Umuada leaders against upholding patriarchal norms and being at the forefront of woman-to-woman violence, as evident in widowhood practices and the excessive use of force as a means of control, writes GODFREY GEORGE in this second part of a two-part series

Between fear and pride

For some, the Umuada remain nothing short of lionesses, unyielding guardians of justice and cultural order.

In his recollection, a Facebook user, Chijioke Okoli, spoke with pride about his maternal home, where the Umuada reigned as a formidable force.

“They are lionesses who are strong in wealth and activities,” he said, describing women with nicknames like Oche Eze Nwanyi, Lady Gold, Ada eji eje mba, and Egodimma. His late mother, once the Secretary-General, was known as Lady Bomber or China Umu Agbala.

“I dare say the Umunnas listen to them. They are the pillars and shakers of the father’s land. Among them are former and present commissioners, retired permanent secretaries, lecturers, and top businesswomen who are billionaires in their own right.”

Okoli remembered a burial where the Umuada turned grief into reckoning.

The deceased, an elderly woman, had allegedly died of neglect at the hands of her children.

“Early that morning, before the clergy could begin, the women gathered, wielding firewood. They demanded that the children bring out the ‘meat’ they had killed, so they could roast and eat. Wearing gloves and nose masks, they sang songs, calling the children murderers. The burial could not be held. Not even the priest nor the Umunnas could stop them.”

It was not a mere spectacle. It was an indictment, a cultural trial. For hours, the children knelt, begging for forgiveness before the burial was allowed to proceed.

“If there is one thing I am proud of in my maternal home,” Okoli added, “it is these powerful women. My mom would be so proud of them.”

Others echo this reverence. Another Facebook user, Prince Jonathan Chuks, remembered how, as a boy, the Umuada intervened in the home of a neighbour notorious for battering his wife.

“One very early morning, before the man could wake up, they all gathered in his compound with a cane. The beating that man received that day from his bed brought back some sense into him. That incident ended the fights in that household to date.”

For him, such interventions proved the Umuada were indispensable. He added, “This circle should never be abolished because they are really doing an amazing thing to see that society gets better.”

But where Okoli and Chuks saw heroism, others remembered only the chaos.

Asadu Chinelo recalled her grandmother’s burial, when the Umuada insisted on a goat at 1 am.

“The kind kata kata (hassle) that unfolded before a goat was brought that night was indescribable. It was war. My aunties cried.”

Okoli, responding to her, explained: “They strike usually when something is going wrong. Their demands are a way of stifling people who may want to claim to be above traditions.”

For Alex Chuks, the memory of his grandfather’s burial is coloured by humiliation.

“These women came with chaos that night, demanding all of the cow heads (isi ewu). Nobody said a word. Even my dad was mute. I can’t forget that day.”

Others have learned to tread carefully. An actor, Cyriacus Ozoemena, remembered his mother’s burial as a seamless experience only because he obeyed her dying counsel: to respect the Umuada and meet their demands without hesitation.

“They even pitied me as the only son not to do certain things, but I told them that I loved my mom so much and if there’s anything needed, they should let me know, and I would find a way. The burial was a success.”

For Ozoemena, their presence was not a threat but a shield. The highlight of the day, he recalled, was when he and his sister were called upon to dance for their mother. The Umuada showered them with money, sealing the day with their approval.

Across testimonies, one thing is clear: whether feared or celebrated, the Umuada still wield a power that bends families. Their authority provokes admiration in some and resentment in others, but never indifference.

In defence of Umuada

Controversy has recently shadowed the Umuada, yet to understand their authority and recent public actions, it is important first to listen to how they describe themselves and the work they do.

At the Lagos branch of the Umuada Igbo Organisation, the group’s own statement underscores this purpose.

As the branch note reads, “The crest also carries the inscription Umuada Nma Nma, a phrase that loosely translates as ‘daughters of beauty,’ underscoring the pride and identity that members attach to their collective heritage.”

The statement continues, “The organisation’s stated mission is to foster peace and unity among Igbo women everywhere, and to invest time, efforts, and resources into initiatives that benefit its members.

“It also commits to promoting Igbo culture, values, and traditions, pledging to safeguard, uphold, and enhance these within wider society. Another part of its stated mandate is the encouragement and promotion of family values, which it identifies as the bedrock of a stable community.”

Such words matter. They place the Umuada within a framework of cultural stewardship, mutual support, and public service. They describe a network that sees its role as preserving identity, strengthening family ties, and creating platforms for mentorship, education, and empowerment.

The organisation’s own vision and objectives make the case explicit.

Senior Lecturer, Department of Political Science, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Dr Ugwueze Ikechukwu

In a May 18, 2025, post, Agbaranwanyi Ngozika Nneochie wrote of a meeting that “has been made yet another remarkable day in the history of Ogbako Umuada Odinana Igbo Cultural Association” and announced an engagement with HRH Omu Onyebuchie Okonkwo that “has again opened another door of opportunity for the accomplishment and realisation of the vision of this organisation.”

She went on to list the association’s aims: “To promote the true Odinana woman; to make the world know about the Igbo traditional woman; to bring back the true power of womanhood in Odinana Igbo; to bring back the sidelined traditions in Igbo land; to empower the Igbo girl child to be independent.”

At the Mbaise branch of the Umuada society, two of its executives expressed frustration over what they described as “growing misconceptions” about the role of the group in Igbo communities.

One of the women, who declined to give her name, insisted that the Umuada remain the moral compass and custodians of Igbo tradition.

“You don’t disobey nature. We are nature. We are the mothers,” she declared, her voice firm. “If we say, ‘do this,’ we know what we are saying. We are custodians of tradition. If we allow you people to do as you like, things will spoil in Igbo land.”

For her, the society’s role is not merely symbolic but deeply practical, ensuring that families and communities do not deviate from long-established norms. She described this oversight as both a responsibility and a sacred calling.

Another executive, who introduced herself simply as Mrs Chinwe, offered more pointed examples.

According to the woman, who is also a chief, Umuada in Mbaise often intervene in disputes between young wives and their in-laws.

“How can a young girl who is married into our community be maltreating her mother-in-law? It’s not done, na,” she said. “We will send her packing. We will teach her a lesson. Even the police know that this one is a family affair.”

She narrated a recent incident that, to her, underscored why the Umuada cannot relent.

“The other day, I learnt that a woman was caught in adultery. That is an abomination. It is like you want us to pamper this generation. This is tradition,” she said, shaking her head. “We have even soft-pedalled on a lot of things. It’s what is keeping Igbo society together.”

Why Umuada are respected in Igbo land – Ohanaeze

The weight of the Umuada institution in Igboland is not in doubt, a fact underscored by cultural leaders who continue to hold them in reverence despite the sometimes controversial methods of enforcing their authority.

A titled chief and former spokesperson for the foremost Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Dr Alex Ogbonnia, described the group as “peacemakers” who preach truth and love in their families, and whose impartiality has earned them deep respect across generations.

“They are also character moulders in various ways,” Ogbonnia explained. “Because they maintain a strong emotional attachment to their maiden families, each time the community gathers for any occasion, the Umuada are given a special role to play. If you kill a cow, from the lower limb down is given to the Umuada.”

That authority, he stressed, extends beyond symbolic gestures into the practical management of community affairs. Whether at marriages, funerals, or disputes, the Umuada’s stance is decisive.

“They also have their interventionist role, so when there is chaos, whatever stance they take is always respected. It’s a formidable and coordinated institution that cannot be bought with money, and no one can defy the authority of the Umuada as it is in Igboland today,” Ogbonnia said.

He admitted that modernity has altered their operations but has not eroded their influence.

The biggest change, he noted, lies in issues of distance and intermarriage. Many women now live far from their maiden homes and cannot attend to family matters as regularly as before.

Ogbonnia, a lecturer of Political Science at Godfrey Okoye University, argued that it was always wiser to avoid provoking the Umuada and instead, honour the traditions they uphold. For him, their role mirrors “the female psychology.”

This sometimes creates tension between their actions and formal law.

“Many things they are doing now are not all that are within the purview of the law, but inasmuch as they are against the law, they are customary. They are the customs of the community. That is where the customs of the community and law run contrary to each other,” Ogbonnia observed.

For a Senior Lecturer of Political Science at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Dr Ugwueze Ikechukwu, what is often described as the “women’s government” in Igboland is no trivial matter.

In his words, it is “a very serious and unbreakable government.” His advice to men is simple: “The best thing for us, men, is to run away, because it is the best strategy available.

"Separated conjoined twins Hassana, Hussaina return to Kano after Saudi surgery","Tukur Muntari

Kano State Governor, Abba Yusuf, on Friday received the Nigerian conjoined twins, Hassana and Hussaina, who returned to the country after undergoing a successful separation surgery in Saudi Arabia.

The twins, who arrived at the Malam Aminu Kano International Airport with their family, were welcomed to a warm reception by government officials, community members, and representatives of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

The life-saving operation was carried out at the King Abdullah Specialist Children’s Hospital in Riyadh under the directives of King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Hassana and Hussaina had been flown to Saudi Arabia in October 2023, where a team of 38 specialists, including pediatric surgeons, neurosurgeons, and plastic surgeons, performed the delicate procedure that lasted about 14 hours and was completed in nine stages.

Doctors discovered that the twins were joined at the lower abdomen, pelvis, and spine, sharing vital structures that made the case particularly complex.

After careful planning, a multi-disciplinary team of 38 consultants and specialists, including experts in pediatric surgery, neurosurgery, orthopaedics, urology, anaesthesia, and plastic surgery, embarked on the delicate procedure.

Speaking at the airport, Yusuf expressed gratitude to the Saudi authorities for sponsoring the surgery and pledged that the state government would take responsibility for the girls’ welfare, including their education up to the university level.

The Consular General of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in Kano, Khalil Ahmed Al-Admawi, who was present at the airport to welcome the family, described the success of the surgery as a demonstration of the Kingdom’s commitment to humanitarian service.

“Saudi Arabia would continue to extend medical assistance and goodwill to countries in need through King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre, especially Nigeria with which it shares historic ties,” he said.

He said the separation of Hassana and Husaina marks the 65th successful operation under the Saudi Siamese Twins Separation Program, which has provided care for 150 sets of conjoined twins from 25 countries over the past 35 years.

The program has become one of the most prominent medical humanitarian initiatives globally, showcasing Saudi Arabia’s expertise in pediatric surgery and its dedication to supporting vulnerable families.

"FG spends N23bn on PHC revitalisation, cautions against sabotage","Sodiq Ojuroungbe

The Federal Government has claimed to have spent over N23 billion on the revitalisation of Primary Health Care Centres across the country as part of efforts to strengthen Nigeria’s primary healthcare system and improve access to essential services.

The government also issued a stern warning to health workers and government officials against diverting or sabotaging medical equipment and essential drugs being distributed to PHCs nationwide.

The Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr. Muyi Aina, said this on Thursday in Abuja during the official flag-off of the distribution of medical equipment and health commodities to PHCs.

Providing a breakdown of the expenditure, Aina revealed that over N9 billion has been spent on procuring and deploying medical equipment, while more than N14 billion was used to procure essential health commodities such as drugs and vaccines.

Aina said that 1,295 PHCs have so far been completely refurbished, with 38 of them now benefiting from newly installed solar power systems.

He added that over 69,000 frontline health workers have been trained and provided with uniforms and work kits through partnerships, including support from the Renewed Hope Initiative led by the First Lady.

He also noted that some states were now taking ownership of the reforms by hiring additional healthcare personnel.

“Kaduna, for example, has recruited 216 skilled health attendants and 969 community-based health workers,” Aina said.

On maternal and child health, Aina highlighted progress under the Maternal and Child Health Initiative, revealing that 411,000 pregnant women have been enrolled across 21 states, with 30,587 already receiving care, including antenatal services and referrals for diagnostics.

The NPHCDA boss urged state governments to allocate more resources to staffing and maintaining PHCs to sustain the momentum.

He also called on Nigerians to support upcoming immunisation campaigns aimed at reaching over 109 million citizens aged 14 and below.

These campaigns, he said, will integrate measles and polio vaccinations with other key interventions such as nutrition and malaria prevention.

Also speaking, the Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Professor Muhammad Ali Pate, stressed that the initiative marks a critical milestone in the government’s agenda to rebuild a functional and accessible health system, particularly for underserved communities.

According to Pate, the health sector has suffered prolonged neglect, with many PHCs left in disrepair, lacking both manpower and essential resources.

He said the ongoing revitalisation efforts aim to reverse this trend by ensuring facilities are not only rebuilt but also fully equipped and adequately staffed.

He added, “For too long, our primary health care centres have languished. They are not very functional in many areas. Our mothers have to travel long distances for delivery, and many of them die in the process. Children missed their vaccinations. Communities didn’t have much hope.”

He warned that the government would not tolerate the diversion or misuse of the newly distributed supplies, vowing that anyone found culpable would face consequences, regardless of their position.

“We will not stand idly by while these resources are misused. Any frontline worker, any health facility manager, any local government or state official, or even federal official who diverts anything that is deployed to serve our people will face consequences,” Pate warned.

The minister described the distribution not as a symbolic event but as a tangible fulfilment of promises made two years ago under the Tinubu administration’s Renewed Hope Agenda to overhaul the primary health care system.

He stressed, “This is not just an event, but it is also a promise kept. Two years ago, we embarked on an ambitious effort to revitalise the primary health care system, setting targets, and now we are seeing that promise being kept.”

Pate, while acknowledging the contributions of development partners like GAVI, the Global Fund, WHO, UNICEF, and UNFPA, reaffirmed the Federal Government’s commitment to ensuring that no Nigerian is left behind in accessing quality healthcare.

“Today’s flag-off is further proof that the Nigerian health system can rise again and proof that President Bola Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda is real. Let us join together to build a health system that leaves no Nigerian behind,” he stated.",https://healthwise.punchng.com/fg-spends-n23bn-on-phc-revitalisation-cautions-against-sabotage/#respond,https://punchng.com
NAFDAC sensitises fruit sellers in Billiri on dangers of calcium carbide,"Chima Azubuike

Following reports of artificial fruits ripening with calcium carbide in Billiri Local Government Area of Gombe State the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control on Friday carried out a sensitisation exercise.

Fruits provide the body with micronutrients that improve immunity and prevent diseases among other benefits. Fruit ripening is a unique aspect of plant development, which makes the fruit edible, softer, sweeter, more palatable, nutritious, and attractive.

However, the consumption of fruits such as mango, banana, plantain, guava, orange, grape, etc or any other fruits ripened with calcium carbide is dangerous to health.

Speaking during the exercise, NAFDAC’s Gombe State Coordinator, Pharmacist James Agada, said the agency’s intervention followed reports that some fruits in the area were suspected to have been ripened with calcium carbide.

“Calcium carbide poses serious health risks to consumers. Our intervention seeks to protect public health by encouraging fruit sellers to adopt safe practices,” Agada said.

On how sellers and buyers can identify artificially ripened fruits, Agada added, “Fruits artificially ripened with calcium carbide may be ripe on the skin, the inside remain unripe. You can identify such artificially ripened fruits if you notice that the fruits are all yellow whereas the stem is dark, this is true especially with banana and plantain. In addition, naturally ripened fruits usually have brown or black spots, while those artificially ripened have traces of powdery substances and peel off quickly.”

He added, “Consumption of fruits containing these impurities may cause cancer, heart, kidney and liver failure. They may also cause frequent thirst. irritation in mouth and nose, weakness, permanent skin damage, difficulty in swallowing, vomiting, skin ulcer and so forth.”

Agada explained that NAFDAC’s strategy was to educate and sensitise vendors before moving to enforcement.

“We want to appeal to the conscience of fruit sellers to do the right thing. But let me be clear—those who persist in violating the regulations will face sanctions. Protecting public health remains our priority,” he added.

Agada further urged fruit sellers to report anyone using calcium carbide and to always check for NAFDAC registration numbers on products. He also introduced the vendors to the Green Book app, NAPAMS, and Scan2Verify platforms, which can be used to confirm product authenticity.

In his response, the Chairman of the Fruit Sellers Association in Billiri LGA, Alhaji Murtala Mohammed, commended NAFDAC for the initiative and pledged the traders’ compliance with its guidelines.

“We are grateful to NAFDAC for this enlightenment. I want to warn our members against using calcium carbide because of its harmful effects. There are safer alternatives like pear and garden egg extracts that can be used for ripening fruits,” Mohammed said.

FG rallies African leaders for malaria elimination by 2030,"Sodiq Ojuroungbe

The Federal Government has called for a renewed and aggressive continental strategy to eradicate malaria in Africa, following alarming statistics that show the disease claimed 597,000 lives across the continent in 2023 alone.

Speaking at the Meeting on Harnessing Africa’s Central Role Against Malaria – The Big Push, held on Thursday at the Abuja Continental Hotel, the Minister of State for Health and Social Welfare, Dr. Iziaq Salako, said Africa must adopt a more urgent and coordinated approach to eliminate the disease, which remains a leading cause of death despite being preventable and treatable.

Salako revealed that Africa accounted for 94 per cent of global malaria cases and 95 per cent of malaria deaths in 2023, amounting to 263 million infections and placing the region at the epicentre of the global malaria crisis.

“It is extremely distressing that malaria, a disease that is both preventable and treatable, continues to be a leading cause of illness and death in Nigeria and throughout the African continent,” Salako said.

He stressed that the current pace of action is insufficient to achieve the continent’s goal of eliminating malaria by 2030, urging stakeholders to deploy a “big push” that includes mobilising political will, resources, and innovation.

The meeting was hosted by the Nigerian government in collaboration with the Roll Back Malaria Partnership, the African Leaders Malaria Alliance, and with the support of the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.

The minister highlighted several emerging threats to malaria control, including increasing resistance to insecticides, climate change-induced extreme weather events, ongoing humanitarian crises, and widening funding gaps.

He said insecticide resistance was reversing progress in some regions, as mosquitoes adapt to existing control methods.

He added that floods and droughts, driven by climate change, have created new breeding grounds for malaria vectors while disrupting healthcare systems.

Salako also pointed out that displaced populations in conflict or disaster zones remain highly vulnerable due to a lack of access to prevention and treatment.

The health minister warned that closing the funding gap was critical to sustaining the fight, adding that more investment is needed in research, development of new tools, and expanding access to treatment and prevention.

“Available resources to fuel research, develop new tools and strategies, and ensure access to effective treatment still fall short,” he said.

The minister called on governments, NGOs, private sector actors, and communities to strengthen collaboration, ramp up education and awareness campaigns, and ensure wide distribution of tools such as insecticide-treated nets, malaria vaccines, and quality-assured combination therapies.

He also highlighted Nigeria’s renewed efforts, including the Advisory for Malaria Elimination in Nigeria, the Malaria Elimination Task Force, the test-and-treat strategy, and the introduction of the malaria vaccine as key components of the national response.

Salako stressed that defeating malaria would require a united front and sustained leadership.

He noted, “Countries that have eliminated the disease must persevere, adapt, and accelerate their efforts to outpace malaria’s relentless progress and prevent re-establishment.

“Those of us still battling the scourge must diligently operationalise existing strategies and implement new actions.”

Lagos residents commend LAWMA for cost-effective waste services,"Agency

Some residents in the FESTAC area of Lagos State have praised the Lagos State Waste Management Authority for its prompt and efficient waste collection services.

The commendation came in separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria on Wednesday in Lagos, with residents highlighting the improvements over previous arrangements.

Before LAWMA’s consistent presence, residents largely relied on informal waste collectors, popularly known as Abokis, to dispose of domestic waste. However, they noted that LAWMA has proven more reliable, with scheduled waste pick-ups every Thursday and occasionally on Sundays.

This regularity, they said, has significantly reduced indiscriminate dumping and environmental pollution, giving residents confidence that their waste would be collected on schedule. Residents also noted that LAWMA’s services are more affordable than those offered by local Abokis.

Mrs. Grace Momodu of 5th Avenue explained, “LAWMA services suit my budget better than the Abokis because I don’t always have waste to dispose of, yet they can charge high amounts. For example, informal carriers may charge as much as ₦1,000 per pick-up, while LAWMA charges ₦1,000 monthly for the same service.”

Similarly, Mrs. Eniola Omotola, a resident of 22 Road, commended the cost-effectiveness of LAWMA’s services. “LAWMA charges ₦1,000 per month, regardless of the amount of waste. But if I hand the same amount to the Abokis, they tend to charge higher because there’s a limit to what they can carry,” she said.

Mr. Emmanuel James emphasised the convenience and broader coverage of LAWMA compared to informal collectors. “Sometimes you may need the Aboki, and they may not be available. That’s why we prefer LAWMA. They can collect waste from the entire close, whereas Abokis have limits—they can’t carry all the waste from even one close, let alone a whole block,” he said.

Ms. Blessed-Gift Nwaruh of 3rd Avenue acknowledged that LAWMA’s services have improved over the years, but suggested more could be done. “In the past, our area looked really dirty. Now, LAWMA officials pick up waste earlier than before. Still, more can be done to ensure a cleaner environment as we work to restore FESTAC Town to its former glory,” she said.

NIWA to recruit 800 water marshals to boost safety,"Agency

The National Inland Waterways Authority, says plans are ongoing to recruit and deploy about 800 water marshals across the country by December.

The recruitment, according to the Managing Director of NIWA, Mr Bola Oyebamiji, is part of efforts to strengthen safety and regulation on Nigeria’s waterways.

Oyebamiji, while addressing newsmen on Wednesday in Abuja, said the move was aimed at curbing incessant boat mishaps, enforcing life jacket compliance, and monitoring unauthorised loading points.

According to him, part of the responsibilities of the water marshals is to sensitise passengers and operators on safe navigation practices.

“The Federal Government is doing a wonderful job on water safety. We have all the gadgets to enhance safety.

“We currently have between 350 and 450 water marshals and the goal is to increase the number of marshals to ensure that authorised jetties across the country have more than one marshal to enforce safety rules.

“All the equipment and the navigational aids we need are provided and we plan to have more police and more marshals to monitor our waterways because they are not enough.

“We are working to increase the number before the end of the year to 800 if we have the opportunity to finance it,” he said.

Oyebamiji said there were about four to five monitoring teams, including task forces deployed across all waterways, especially in riverine areas to complement efforts of the water marshals.

He urged boat users to adhere to safety rules and instructions given by water marshals before takeoff for their own safety and benefit.

According to him, boats users must discard water protection superstitious beliefs and adhere to scientifically provided safety and protection rules, especially the use of life jackets which increase chances of survival in cases of mishaps.

He called on the National Assembly to expedite the passage of the Coastal Guard Bill for maritime safety.

Oyebamiji also stressed the need for collaborations with riverine state governments to enhance water safety.

"Green roofs may tackle flooding in Lagos, says researcher","Sodiq Ojuroungbe

A Nigerian environmental researcher, Oluwaseun Adeyinka, has warned that Lagos risks deepening environmental inequality and worsening flood disasters if it fails to adopt green roof technology as part of its urban infrastructure strategy.

Adeyinka, a PhD researcher in environmental science and management at Montclair State University, USA, said that the successful implementation of green roofs in New York City can serve as a replicable blueprint for solving pressing urban and environmental challenges in Lagos.

Speaking exclusively with PUNCH Healthwise, the environmental researcher said green roofs, vegetation-based rooftop systems, could help absorb stormwater, reduce heat, and improve air quality in flood-prone communities such as the Island, Mushin, Agege, and Ajegunle.

“Lagos must act now before climate risks become permanent and environmental inequality becomes entrenched,” she said.

Adeyinka, who is currently a Senior Research Officer at the National Biotechnology Development Agency, whose research has been on renewable energy and sustainable development, based her findings on a study of over 500 green roofs across 82 zip codes in New York City.

Her research revealed that green roofs in NYC are mostly concentrated in high-income areas, exposing the environmental divide that also mirrors inequality in Lagos.

Speaking further about her research, Adeyinka explained that just like New York, Lagos suffers from severe flooding, poor drainage systems, increasing surface temperatures, and limited green space, all symptoms of unchecked urban sprawl and environmental neglect.

With a population exceeding 15 million and continuing to grow rapidly, the environmental expert lamented that Lagos has one of the highest urban densities in the world, yet lacks the green infrastructure needed to absorb rainfall, cool the environment, and improve air quality.

The expert pointed out that over 62,000 acres of rooftop space exist in NYC, yet only 736 buildings have implemented green roofs, representing a mere 0.1 per cent of available rooftops.

She added, “This shows a vast, untapped potential that also exists in cities like Lagos.

However, local laws 92 and 94 have been put in place to mandate buildings over 200sqft to have either a green roof or a solar roof, while local law 57 was enacted to provide awareness, education, and outreach regarding solar and green roofs. These laws have significantly improved the urban resilience of New York City.

“If we can adapt this model to Lagos, enact, enforce, and incentivise laws like these, especially in flood-prone communities like Mushin, Agege, and Ajegunle, we can transform the way the city handles water, pollution, and heat,” the environmental expert noted.

Speaking on the enormous importance of green roofs, Adeyinka also called eco-roofs or living roofs, the researcher said green roofs can help manage stormwater runoff, reduce urban heat, filter air pollutants, reduce noise reduction by acting as sound insulators, reduce urban microplastics, provide ecological benefits such as biodiversity enhancement in dense urban environments, carbon sequestration, rooftop gardening for food production, mental health benefits through increased access to nature, enhanced energy efficiency, increased property value through higher resale and rental prices, and increased roof life span to up to 50 yrs.

According to her, these living systems can retain between 50 and 90 per cent of rainfall, which would significantly ease the burden on Lagos’s overwhelmed drainage infrastructure.

She stated, “In Germany and Singapore, for instance, green roofs are practically standard in building codes and heavily incentivised by the government. Lagos can do the same by adopting smart regulations and offering financial incentives to building owners who go green.”

Adeyinka argued that with a clear policy direction, Lagos could pioneer green infrastructure in Africa, starting with government-owned buildings and high-profile corporate structures.

“Corporations in Lagos, especially those headquartered in places like Victoria Island and Ikoyi, must see this as part of their ESG responsibility and sustainability initiatives.

“Green roofs can help them meet their sustainability goals while also offering functional benefits like energy efficiency and staff wellness,” she noted.

Adeyinka, whose comprehensive study titled ‘Green Roof Implementation in New York City” explores the intersection of climate resilience and environmental justice in densely populated cities, argued that Lagos faces the same structural challenges as NYC but with more intense climate risks and deeper socioeconomic divides.

She believes Lagos must act fast before environmental inequality becomes an entrenched part of its urban future.

The study, which involved spatial and statistical analysis of 511 green roofs across zip codes in New York, found that green roofs were disproportionately located in affluent neighbourhoods, such as Manhattan’s Chelsea area.

Adeyinka’s research found a strong correlation between green roof density and median property values, while areas with low property values and low income had significantly fewer green roofs.

This environmental disparity, she said, mirrors the kinds of urban inequality seen in Lagos, where access to infrastructure and environmental protections is often determined by wealth and political influence.

To adapt this model to Lagos, Adeyinka recommends using the same data-driven approach she used in New York.

“Just like NYC zip codes, we can use Local Government Areas (LGAs) or wards in Lagos to map green infrastructure gaps.

“By correlating that with household income, property values, and education levels, we can create a real-time urban and ecological equity map,” she said.

The research also dives into why green roofs remain rare in most cities. High design and construction costs, maintenance burdens, limited public awareness, and a lack of government incentives remain the biggest obstacles.

With the rainy season intensifying and more Nigerian cities facing climate-related disasters, Adeyinka’s research highlights a growing call for climate-conscious infrastructure that is both equitable and urgent.

Adeyinka emphasised that her study’s findings align with several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, including those promoting sustainable cities, climate action, and reduced inequalities.

She said that implementing similar research in Lagos would not only help the city cope with flooding and rising heat but also ensure that green infrastructure is not reserved for the elite.

“If Lagos doesn’t make green infrastructure a priority now, it risks deepening environmental inequality for decades to come.

“This is a chance to correct course before the climate crisis overwhelms the poorest communities,” Adeyinka warned.

Why we no longer wear bras — Women,"Idowu Abdullahi

Some women have cited comfort, health concerns, and personal freedom as major reasons they are choosing to go braless.

For the increasing number of women abandoning the undergarment, the decision reflects a shift away from long-held fashion norms towards prioritising body comfort and self-expression.

Findings by PUNCH Healthwise revealed that while some women opted to ditch their bras to avoid skin irritation and tightness, others attributed the change to lifestyle adjustment.

The women noted that returning to bras afterwards felt unnecessary and restrictive.

Beyond comfort, some women told PUNCH Healthwise that going braless has boosted their body confidence and helped them challenge societal expectations around women’s appearance.

They added that their choices are not only about fashion but also about health, freedom, and redefining personal comfort.

Speaking with our correspondent, a 28-year-old woman, Glory Joseph, said her decision was influenced by her breast size, adding that going braless has been more comfortable.

According to her, I stopped because of how painful and tight it is for us with bigger boobs.

“I stopped for comfort. The pain of wearing a bra and not feeling comfortable for someone with big boobs is enough to influence my decision. Nothing makes me happier than being comfortable and more relaxed,” she said.

Joseph noted that while the reaction of people around her for not wearing bras had been “bad”, she encouraged other women to choose the option if they felt the need.

“They should do whatever makes them feel comfortable and more relaxed,” she said.

Also speaking, Oladele Omowunmi, said the iron inside the braiser had made using it uncomfortable.

“I stopped wearing bras when I started feeling uncomfortable between my breasts when the iron inside the bra came out, so I stopped, and I feel very comfortable.

“I feel very comfortable dressing or going out without a bra, but some dress requires a bra, that’s when you see me in a bra,” Omowunmi said.

She said that while going braless had given her the needed comfort, the look from people when she’s going out made her uncomfortable in her skin.

“They try to look straight at my nipples first,” she said.

Omowunmi added, “Those who intend to stop should only think twice about whether they are comfortable with it or not.”

On her part, Abigail Oluchi said since the day she summoned the courage to go out without a bra, she had never looked back.

According to her, I believe everyone has their own choices.

“I feel lighter and more comfortable without a bra. I had never gone out without wearing one before, but the day I finally did, I felt a bit uneasy, and the looks from people weren’t very pleasant,” Oluchi told PUNCH Healthwise.

Also speaking, 32-year-old Oluwatosin Abayomi said she opted to ditch the undergarment wear for body confidence.

“I stopped wearing bras because of comfort, body confidence, and lifestyle changes.

“And I feel freer and happier, though experiences differ based on body type, environment, and confidence level,” Abayomi said.

For Hussain Adenike, she said her decision followed medical advice from her gynecologist, adding that though people’s reactions are embarrassing, her health remains important.

“Yes, I feel very comfortable, healthy, and free. My decision is based on advice from my gynecologist.

“To be sincere, how people react to it sometimes is embarrassing and annoying,” she said.

On her advice for women considering going braless, the 32-year-old said, “What I would say to them, especially for those who have tangible reasons, is that for as long as they feel comfortable and they are confident, regardless of how people feel or what they say about them, they’re good to go.”

Experts react



The debate on whether women should wear bras or abandon them for comfort continues to stir public conversations.

But medical experts have warned that while bras provide physical and psychological benefits, ill-fitted ones may lead to discomfort, infections, and long-term health problems.

The experts, who spoke to our correspondent, explained that bras support posture, prevent sagging, and improve confidence, but poor sizing and unhygienic use expose women to skin irritation, infections, and pain.

They advised women to prioritise comfort, correct fitting, and hygiene to reduce risks associated with bra usage.

They also stressed that women with sensitive skin should pay particular attention to the materials used in their underwear.

Array

A Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Ibadan, Oyo State, Chris Aimakhu, told PUNCH Healthwise that bras were designed to offer multiple benefits, especially for women with large breasts.

“If you look at it that way, you will know that bras provide a lot of benefits. For women with very big breasts, not wearing one can cause pain and discomfort, especially during physical activity, even when just walking,” the don said.

According to him, bras improve posture by distributing the weight of the breasts uniformly, thereby reducing back pain, sweating, and physical strain.

He added that well-fitted bras also relieve pressure and prevent excessive bouncing of the breasts.

“When you see a woman wearing a bra, you can notice that her body looks uniform because the breasts are properly supported. Additionally, they boost confidence. Whether a woman has large or small breasts, bras help her feel more confident because she knows she looks good,” the consultant obstetric gynecologist said.

On long-term benefits, Aimakhu said bras help prevent sagging and provide firm support during periods such as breastfeeding or milk engorgement.

“Breasts are made up of tissue and ligaments. If you wear a well-fitted bra, it supports the breasts and helps maintain firmness. During breastfeeding, when breasts are heavier and more likely to sag, wearing a firm bra helps to reduce drooping,” he said.

However, the gynaecologist warned that the benefits of bras could easily turn into risks when they are not well-fitted.

The don said, “If a bra is too big, it won’t give proper support. If it’s too tight, it can cause pain and irritation. Some tight bras may restrict blood circulation. Others may cause skin irritation, dryness, or limit free movement. So, it’s about wearing the right size for your body.”

Array

Also speaking, a Consultant Physician/Dermatologist, Dr. Roli Madubuko, highlighted how bras could trigger skin problems if worn improperly.

“When bras are ill-fitted—especially tight ones—they increase the tendency for friction. With friction, the skin begins to rub against the material, and that could lead to redness, chafing, and soreness,” she explained.

She noted that moisture build-up under bras creates a breeding ground for bacteria and fungi, predisposing women to infections such as boils, folliculitis, and fungal rashes.

“Sometimes, some people may also be sensitive to bra components like metallic clips made from nickel. That predisposes them to itching and scratching, which then allows infections to enter the skin,” she added.

Madubuko, who is also an Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Benin, Benin City, Edo State, further warned that poor hygiene habits worsen the risks.

The dermatologist said, “Some people could wear bras for one week without washing them. When that happens, there is a build-up of bacteria and fungi, and that could also lead to infections.”

She advised women with sensitive skin to opt for breathable cotton bras, avoid nylon and polyester, and wash their bras daily.

Madubuko advised women to balance comfort, proper fitting, and hygiene to enjoy the benefits of bras without exposing themselves to unnecessary health risks.",https://healthwise.punchng.com/why-we-no-longer-wear-bras-women/,https://punchng.com

Joseph noted that while the reaction of people around her for not wearing bras had been “bad”, she encouraged other women to choose the option if they felt the need.

“They should do whatever makes them feel comfortable and more relaxed,” she said.

Also speaking, Oladele Omowunmi, said the iron inside the braiser had made using it uncomfortable.

“I stopped wearing bras when I started feeling uncomfortable between my breasts when the iron inside the bra came out, so I stopped, and I feel very comfortable.

“I feel very comfortable dressing or going out without a bra, but some dress requires a bra, that’s when you see me in a bra,” Omowunmi said.

She said that while going braless had given her the needed comfort, the look from people when she’s going out made her uncomfortable in her skin.

“They try to look straight at my nipples first,” she said.

Omowunmi added, “Those who intend to stop should only think twice about whether they are comfortable with it or not.”

On her part, Abigail Oluchi said since the day she summoned the courage to go out without a bra, she had never looked back.

According to her, I believe everyone has their own choices.

“I feel lighter and more comfortable without a bra. I had never gone out without wearing one before, but the day I finally did, I felt a bit uneasy, and the looks from people weren’t very pleasant,” Oluchi told PUNCH Healthwise.

Also speaking, 32-year-old Oluwatosin Abayomi said she opted to ditch the undergarment wear for body confidence.

“I stopped wearing bras because of comfort, body confidence, and lifestyle changes.

“And I feel freer and happier, though experiences differ based on body type, environment, and confidence level,” Abayomi said.

For Hussain Adenike, she said her decision followed medical advice from her gynecologist, adding that though people’s reactions are embarrassing, her health remains important.

“Yes, I feel very comfortable, healthy, and free. My decision is based on advice from my gynecologist.

“To be sincere, how people react to it sometimes is embarrassing and annoying,” she said.

On her advice for women considering going braless, the 32-year-old said, “What I would say to them, especially for those who have tangible reasons, is that for as long as they feel comfortable and they are confident, regardless of how people feel or what they say about them, they’re good to go.”

Experts react



The debate on whether women should wear bras or abandon them for comfort continues to stir public conversations.

But medical experts have warned that while bras provide physical and psychological benefits, ill-fitted ones may lead to discomfort, infections, and long-term health problems.

The experts, who spoke to our correspondent, explained that bras support posture, prevent sagging, and improve confidence, but poor sizing and unhygienic use expose women to skin irritation, infections, and pain.

They advised women to prioritise comfort, correct fitting, and hygiene to reduce risks associated with bra usage.

They also stressed that women with sensitive skin should pay particular attention to the materials used in their underwear.

A Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Ibadan, Oyo State, Chris Aimakhu, told PUNCH Healthwise that bras were designed to offer multiple benefits, especially for women with large breasts.

“If you look at it that way, you will know that bras provide a lot of benefits. For women with very big breasts, not wearing one can cause pain and discomfort, especially during physical activity, even when just walking,” the don said.

According to him, bras improve posture by distributing the weight of the breasts uniformly, thereby reducing back pain, sweating, and physical strain.

He added that well-fitted bras also relieve pressure and prevent excessive bouncing of the breasts.

“When you see a woman wearing a bra, you can notice that her body looks uniform because the breasts are properly supported. Additionally, they boost confidence. Whether a woman has large or small breasts, bras help her feel more confident because she knows she looks good,” the consultant obstetric gynecologist said.

On long-term benefits, Aimakhu said bras help prevent sagging and provide firm support during periods such as breastfeeding or milk engorgement.

“Breasts are made up of tissue and ligaments. If you wear a well-fitted bra, it supports the breasts and helps maintain firmness. During breastfeeding, when breasts are heavier and more likely to sag, wearing a firm bra helps to reduce drooping,” he said.

However, the gynaecologist warned that the benefits of bras could easily turn into risks when they are not well-fitted.

The don said, “If a bra is too big, it won’t give proper support. If it’s too tight, it can cause pain and irritation. Some tight bras may restrict blood circulation. Others may cause skin irritation, dryness, or limit free movement. So, it’s about wearing the right size for your body.”

Array

Also speaking, a Consultant Physician/Dermatologist, Dr. Roli Madubuko, highlighted how bras could trigger skin problems if worn improperly.

“When bras are ill-fitted—especially tight ones—they increase the tendency for friction. With friction, the skin begins to rub against the material, and that could lead to redness, chafing, and soreness,” she explained.

She noted that moisture build-up under bras creates a breeding ground for bacteria and fungi, predisposing women to infections such as boils, folliculitis, and fungal rashes.

“Sometimes, some people may also be sensitive to bra components like metallic clips made from nickel. That predisposes them to itching and scratching, which then allows infections to enter the skin,” she added.

Madubuko, who is also an Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Benin, Benin City, Edo State, further warned that poor hygiene habits worsen the risks.

The dermatologist said, “Some people could wear bras for one week without washing them. When that happens, there is a build-up of bacteria and fungi, and that could also lead to infections.”

She advised women with sensitive skin to opt for breathable cotton bras, avoid nylon and polyester, and wash their bras daily.

Madubuko advised women to balance comfort, proper fitting, and hygiene to enjoy the benefits of bras without exposing themselves to unnecessary health risks.",https://healthwise.punchng.com/why-we-no-longer-wear-bras-women/#respond,https://punchng.com
"Gender Inclusion: We must move from rhetoric to delivery, says Gates Foundation","Heallthwise

The Gates Foundation has urged Nigerian leaders to accelerate action on gender equality goals by moving from policy launches to real delivery for women and girls.

The foundation says the success of Nigeria’s development lies in moving from policy launches to real delivery for women in order to achieve common goals in women’s health and inclusive economic growth.

Deputy Director of Programme Advocacy & Communications (PAC) at the Gates Foundation, Ekenem Isichei, made the call during his keynote address at the 2025 Gender and Inclusion Summit organised by the Policy Innovation Centre (PIC) in Abuja.

The summit with the theme: “New Voices and New Approaches for Accelerating Inclusive Society” brought together government, private sector and the civil society to discuss gender inclusion and its impact on economic growth and development.

In his address, Isichei said inclusive growth cannot be achieved unless women are intentionally prioritized in national and state policies while warning that progress made in women’s health and empowerment could stall without stronger institutional delivery and budgetary commitment.

He said: “Our goal is to leverage our knowledge and capital to enable the government to best serve its people to execute on budget commitments for key health innovations, to streamline donor delivery coordination mechanisms, to plan and operationalize national development plans on the state level, and much more.”

Isichei noted that the conversation becomes important at a time that bilateral aid to Nigeria fell by 40 percent as programs that intentionally support women’s health or empowerment remained targeted, adding that funding for maternal and child health dropped by 67 percent.

“We gather at a time when resources and momentum towards gender equality goals are waning. Since we gathered last year, bilateral Official Development Assistance that is aid from a donor country to Nigeria has dropped 40%, and programs that intentionally support women’s health or empowerment were especially targeted.

“Funding towards maternal and child health in Nigeria dropped by 67%. That means that for every three women in your community, two of them will not have access to critical women’s health commodities that they had last year.

“When 70% of Nigeria’s poorest are women, we cannot ignore the unique experiences of women in climbing out of poverty. At the Foundation, we have seen the hard evidence that proves that investing in women’s health and women’s economic empowerment has a lasting impact across generations. It leads to healthier families, stronger economies, and a more just world,” Isichie said.

He called on national and subnational governments to invest in skills systems and staying power to implement programmes effectively and not just to launch. “This means institutionalizing gender desks, strengthening planning & budget units, and equipping local PHC managers and Gender Officers with the tools and data to lead with impact.”

He also called for dedicated public resources for women, saying gender-responsive budgeting “cannot remain an annual budget exercise.” Calling for clear expenditure targets for women-led MSME, which must be protected, disbursed and monitored.

The Gates Foundation recently pledged $2.5 billion through 2030 for research and development in women’s health, calling on government, the private sector, and civil society to co-invest.

Though civil society groups were praised for pushing inclusion into the national conversations and matching urgency with operational clarity, Isichie urged private sector leaders to see inclusion as smart economics rather than charity.

Meanwhile, the chairperson of Nigeria Governors’ Spouses’ Forum (NGSF), Professor Olufolake Abdulrazaq, reiterated the Forum’s commitment to advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment, pledging stronger interventions to dismantle systemic barriers.

Abdulrazaq said that various state-level reforms are already underway, stressing that Kwara State has signed a 35 percent gender inclusion bill into law, while 10 states now grant six months of maternity leave to working mothers.

"LASG empowers 1,700 women with working tools","Gbenga Oloniniran

The Lagos State Government has distributed working tools to 1,700 women under its Micro Enterprise Support Initiative, reaffirming its commitment to empowering women and dismantling barriers to their advancement.

Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, represented by his wife, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, spoke at the Y2025 second phase of the programme organised by the Ministry of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, held at Blue Roof, Alausa, Ikeja.

According to the governor, the initiative reflects the government’s drive to create an enabling environment where women can flourish, protect their rights, and expand opportunities for economic self-reliance.

“One of my greatest passions as governor of this state is to empower our women,” Sanwo-Olu said. “Over the years, I have seen first-hand that when you empower a woman, you empower a family, a community, and indeed the entire society.”

The items distributed included sewing machines, hairdressing kits, stoning machines, aluminium fabricating machines, as well as agricultural tools, fertiliser and seeds.

Sanwo-Olu assured that his administration would continue to strengthen laws, policies and institutions that guarantee women’s safety, dignity and equal opportunities.

“Our administration remains unwavering in protecting the rights of women,” he added.

Ekiti female gov aspirant unveils seven-point agenda,"Abdulrahman Zakariyau

All Progressives Congress female governorship aspirant in Ekiti State, Abimbola Olawunmi, has unveiled a seven-point agenda aimed at rescuing, rebuilding, and restoring the state.

This is meant to be achieved through economic diversification, job creation, education revival, healthcare reform, and transparent governance.

During an interactive session with journalists in Abuja on Sunday, Olawunmi stated that her decision to contest for the governorship of Ekiti State stems from her love for the people and her conviction that the state deserves much better.

She decried the fact that, over the years, successive administrations led by career politicians have failed to fully harness the state’s abundant human and natural resources.

She stated, “This has left our youths disempowered, our economy underdeveloped, and our people struggling unnecessarily under the hardship that has been brought about to the state because of the intentional weaponisation of poverty in the state.

“So, I am motivated by the urgent need to rescue the state from this cycle of underdevelopment and mismanagement.

“I believe that leadership should not be about self-interest or personal gain, but about service to the people a service that is transparent, accountable, and transformative.

“So, my goal is to reposition Ekiti State to become the pride of every citizen of the state.

“So, we are looking at a way that we can bring such development to Ekiti State, and this is what is driving me, this is my motivation, that we want to rescue the state from this state of underdevelopment, bring about the restoration of our infrastructure in the state, and bring about development, empower our youth, empower even our career politicians.”

The Ekiti governorship hopeful pledged to prioritise the empowerment of the people, with a special focus on women and youths.

“I have a seven-point agenda,” she declared.

"Kwara to deworm 776,896 pupils in 15 LGs","Tunde Oyekola

The Kwara State government, on Tuesday, said it plans to deworm 776,896 children, aged five to 14 years across 15 local government areas of the state.

The Commissioner for Health, Dr Amina El-Imam, disclosed this at the flag-off of the deworming exercise at Queen Elizabeth Secondary School, Ilorin.

El-Imam, in a statement by the Assistant Press Secretary, Ministry of Health, Funke Olutimilehin, said the exercise reflected the government’s commitment to protecting children from preventable diseases.

“This year’s mass administration of medicines is targeted at 776,896 school-aged children with deworming tablets in the state, except Oke-Ero Local Government Area.

“Our mission does not stop at treatment alone, we are equally committed to prevention.

“This includes promoting clean water, improving sanitation, and raising awareness about the importance of good hygiene practices,” El-Imam added.

She appreciated Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq for prioritising the health of the people through the support of several health interventions going on in the state.

"Over 50,000 living with HIV/AIDs in Kogi","Gbenga Odogun

The Acting Executive Secretary, Kogi State Agency for the Control of Aids, Ibrahim Anate, has declared that no fewer than 50,000 people are currently living with HIV/AIDs in the state.

Anate disclosed this in an interactive session with journalists during a road Walk in commemoration of the 2024 World AIDS Day in Lokoja, the state capital, on Monday.

The walk was organised by the Centre for Integrated Health Programmes, in collaboration with the Kogi State Agency for the Control of Aids.

In his remarks, Anate said, “About 50,000 people are living with HIV presently out of which 36,066 are presently on treatment in Kogi State.

“We are seriously fighting the scourge and we are giving the awareness to all the community and the hard-to-reach areas of the awareness of HIV in Kogi State.”

He added that the state government, under Alhaji Usman Ododo, is striving to see that people who are living with HIV AIDs are on treatment and pregnant women who are HIV positive deliver negative babies.

“The current administration is also striving to ensure that people who are positive in Kogi State will turn to negative. The government is seriously working hard by providing support to the Ministry of Health, and KOSACA to see that we take the campaign to the very hard-to-reach community and the community at large in Kogi State,” he added.

He explained that with the current security challenges in some parts of the state, some HIV patients find it difficult to access treatment.

Anate, however, appealed to Ododo to sign the Anti Stigma HIV Law, which was recently passed by the state House of Assembly.

“When the governor ascents to this law, people that are HIV positive can have the confidence to come out and declare their status. Many can’t do this because of the stigmatization in the society”, he added.

Also speaking, the Kogi State Technical Lead, Centre for Integrated Health Programmes, Inyama Lawrencia, lamented the transmission of HIV AIDs from mother to child in the state.

“We have been advocating for every mother to go for anti-natal services so that they can know their HIV status. With the record on the ground about mother-to-child HIV transmission, CIHP has been working in the communities to sensitise women to ensure that they come out to the masses to know their HIV status.

“One of the challenges is that due to the economic situation of the country, Some Women who are supposed to go out to know their status don’t even go because of financial constraints”, he noted.

Kaduna secures 11 convictions in gender-based violence cases,"Godwin Isenyo

The Kaduna State Government has said it recorded a significant milestone in its efforts to combat Gender-Based Violence, securing 11 convictions of offenders across the 23 local government areas of the state in 2024.

The Commissioner for Human Services and Social Development, Rabi Salisu, who made this known at a media briefing in Kaduna on Sunday, noted that the state government’s efforts to address GBV have yielded positive results.

“In 2024, Kaduna State secured convictions in 11 GBV cases, a remarkable milestone, particularly in northern Nigeria, where securing even two convictions annually was a challenge in the past,” she said.

The commissioner attributed the increase in GBV reporting to the efforts of the state government and Civil Society Organisations as well as growing trust in government institutions.

She also disclosed that the state government had established four operational Sexual Referral and Assault Centres, one in each senatorial zone, to provide support to victims of GBV.

This was just as she added that the Ministry of Justice has streamlined the judicial process for GBV cases, enabling advisory opinions to be issued within three days.

Salisu said, “Before, many GBV cases were reported anonymously, but now, victims and their families come forward to make formal complaints. This is a significant achievement for Kaduna state, especially when compared to other states in the North.

“These centres focus on preventive measures rather than merely responding to cases, ensuring a proactive approach to tackling GBV.

“This has curtailed delays and led to swifter justice for victims. Most of the convictions resulted in life imprisonment, with some cases carrying the death penalty. Convicted individuals cannot benefit from prison decongestion programs, ensuring justice is served.”

The commissioner stated that the state has also been ranked third in the country and first in the North for reporting GBV cases, according to the National Dashboard.

The state has seen a 30% increase in GBV reporting, which the commissioner attributed to the efforts of the state government and CSOs, as well as growing trust in government institutions.

“We have recorded significant progress in addressing GBV in Kaduna State. We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that victims receive justice and that perpetrators are held accountable,” she said.

Patients knock Rivers hospital over alleged food extortion,"Muhammed Lawal and Dennis Naku

Patients seeking medical services at University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Rivers State, have accused the hospital of forcing them to purchase food.

They also expressed concerns about power outages, the reported poor condition of the hospital’s toilets and bad water.

But the hospital dismissed the claims, describing it as untrue.

According to some of the patients, they were forced to pay for food and had to endure the unbearable smell in their wards, which emanated from the toilets.

In a viral post, an X user, Baridueh Badon (@BadonB), criticise the hospital service.

He described his mother’s six-month stay at the hospital as one of the worst healthcare experiences he ever had.

Narrating the ordeal, he stressed, “The first shock was compulsory feeding. Every patient was forced to eat hospital food. You can’t opt out of it. This food is worse than what people in prison eat. The cost was N2,000 per day. I could not understand why a hospital would force patients to eat their food.”

Also speaking about her experience, a patient at the hospital, Maureen Ikeaguchi, commended the UPHTH on its medical services, even as she said some of its financial bills were needless.

“I was treated well, even when I was in emergency. There was a swift response from them to take care of me. They didn’t even ask us for money for surgery. They had to take care of me first,” she noted.

However, Ikeaguchi said she was handed a food bill of N7,000 that she knew nothing about.

He said, “On the day we were about to leave the hospital, they gave me a bill of N7,000. They said it was for my feeding for the seven days I spent. I never ate their food. We argued but I ended up paying that money. That is one of the unnecessary bills I paid. Patients shouldn’t be forced.”

She further complained about the hospital’s water and toilet facilities.

Speaking with Saturday PUNCH on Thursday, a briefed father, Tony John, who said he lost his son at the hospital, also attested to the good standard of the hospital, though he criticised some of its medical services.

John claimed that the hospital’s staff spent over three hours before a file was opened for his son, just as he condemned what he described as dirtiness and bad water in the hospital.

“Poor electricity was a very serious issue. At the ICU, on the day my boy passed on, I bought 10 litres of fuel for them with a keg.”

Meanwhile, the acting Public Relations Officer of the hospital, Elabha Meni, denied all the claims of the patients and others, stating they were not correct.

Meni said the hospital didn’t experience power outages, just as the emergency areas never shut down.

“Power doesn’t disrupt our services in any way. How can power disrupt surgical procedures when operations are going on? Most times, people base their reports on social media, which isn’t correct,” Meni said.

Justifying the food charges by the hospital, Meni said, “There is inpatient feeding for every patient admitted for diabetes, and the food we give them goes with the treatment. As for the cost, I don’t know what it is. Every hospital has its policies. That is our policy, and they will have to follow it. It is for treatment, and people have to eat certain things.

“If anybody is found wanting on these allegations, through an investigation by the hospital, a decision will be taken because we deal with life. Life can’t be bought, and the management values life.”

Patients knock Rivers hospital over alleged food extortion,"Muhammed Lawal and Dennis Naku

Patients seeking medical services at University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, Rivers State, have accused the hospital of forcing them to purchase food.

They also expressed concerns about power outages, the reported poor condition of the hospital’s toilets and bad water.

But the hospital dismissed the claims, describing it as untrue.

According to some of the patients, they were forced to pay for food and had to endure the unbearable smell in their wards, which emanated from the toilets.

In a viral post, an X user, Baridueh Badon (@BadonB), criticise the hospital service.

He described his mother’s six-month stay at the hospital as one of the worst healthcare experiences he ever had.

Narrating the ordeal, he stressed, “The first shock was compulsory feeding. Every patient was forced to eat hospital food. You can’t opt out of it. This food is worse than what people in prison eat. The cost was N2,000 per day. I could not understand why a hospital would force patients to eat their food.”

Also speaking about her experience, a patient at the hospital, Maureen Ikeaguchi, commended the UPHTH on its medical services, even as she said some of its financial bills were needless.

“I was treated well, even when I was in emergency. There was a swift response from them to take care of me. They didn’t even ask us for money for surgery. They had to take care of me first,” she noted.

However, Ikeaguchi said she was handed a food bill of N7,000 that she knew nothing about.

He said, “On the day we were about to leave the hospital, they gave me a bill of N7,000. They said it was for my feeding for the seven days I spent. I never ate their food. We argued but I ended up paying that money. That is one of the unnecessary bills I paid. Patients shouldn’t be forced.”

She further complained about the hospital’s water and toilet facilities.

Speaking with Saturday PUNCH on Thursday, a briefed father, Tony John, who said he lost his son at the hospital, also attested to the good standard of the hospital, though he criticised some of its medical services.

John claimed that the hospital’s staff spent over three hours before a file was opened for his son, just as he condemned what he described as dirtiness and bad water in the hospital.

“Poor electricity was a very serious issue. At the ICU, on the day my boy passed on, I bought 10 litres of fuel for them with a keg.”

Meanwhile, the acting Public Relations Officer of the hospital, Elabha Meni, denied all the claims of the patients and others, stating they were not correct.

Meni said the hospital didn’t experience power outages, just as the emergency areas never shut down.

“Power doesn’t disrupt our services in any way. How can power disrupt surgical procedures when operations are going on? Most times, people base their reports on social media, which isn’t correct,” Meni said.

Justifying the food charges by the hospital, Meni said, “There is inpatient feeding for every patient admitted for diabetes, and the food we give them goes with the treatment. As for the cost, I don’t know what it is. Every hospital has its policies. That is our policy, and they will have to follow it. It is for treatment, and people have to eat certain things.

“If anybody is found wanting on these allegations, through an investigation by the hospital, a decision will be taken because we deal with life. Life can’t be bought, and the management values life.”

"Gombe records 388 cases of gender-based violence, opens treatment centre","Chima Azubuike

Gombe State has recorded 388 cases of violence against women and 144 cases against men between 2021 and 2024, according to the State Commissioner for Health, Dr Habu Dahiru.

The figures were disclosed on Monday during the launch of the 2024 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence at Pantami Township Stadium.

The campaign, themed “UNiTE! To End Violence Against Women and Girls,” commenced on November 25, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, and will culminate on December 10, Human Rights Day.

Dahiru revealed that gender-based violence affects both genders, although women remain disproportionately impacted.

“In Gombe State, from 2021 to 2024, we recorded 388 female survivors of gender-based violence and 144 male victims,” he said.

“While GBV is more prevalent among women, men are not spared. The data underscores the significance of this issue.”

Efforts to Curb GBV

The commissioner detailed the state’s proactive measures to combat GBV, including the establishment of a dedicated treatment centre at the Specialist Hospital, Gombe.

“The Ministry of Health has taken steps to provide medical services and trauma care for GBV victims. The centre also offers medical reports required for legal cases, ensuring survivors receive justice,” Dahiru said.

“We work closely with the Ministry of Women Affairs and development partners to address the scourge of GBV comprehensively. Victims are encouraged to come forward and report cases without fear or shame.”

Call for Collaboration

In her address, the wife of the Gombe State Governor, Asma’u Yahaya, emphasised the need for collective action.

She cited alarming statistics showing that 35 per cent of women globally experience physical violence in their lifetime, with 59.3 per cent of women in Gombe reporting physical violence since the age of 15.

“The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognises the urgency of eradicating violence against women and girls. Collaboration among all stakeholders is crucial to achieving this goal,” she said.

In her remarks, Gombe State Chief Judge, Justice Sadiyya Mohammed, highlighted the growing concern of abuse against boys, calling for inclusive efforts to protect children.

“The judiciary is committed to ensuring justice for all victims and holding perpetrators accountable,” she said.

“However, it requires collaboration from civil society organisations, religious leaders, and other stakeholders.”

Also reacting, Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development, Asma’u Iganus, urged local government officials, traditional leaders, and donor agencies to play active roles in combating GBV.

“I appeal to Local Government Chairmen and their wives to inaugurate Child Protection Committees at the ward and community levels. Female political appointees and stakeholders must engage their communities to contribute meaningfully to this cause,” she said.

“We need a collective state of emergency to fight violence against women, girls, and persons with special needs.”

By addressing the root causes of GBV and ensuring survivors receive justice, the state government said it hopes to set a benchmark for tackling gender-based violence in Nigeria.

The 16 Days of Activism serves as a rallying point to intensify efforts to end GBV.

As stakeholders converge on this critical issue, the Gombe State government says the message is clear: violence against women and girls is preventable, and its eradication is essential for building a safe and inclusive society.

Gender equity starts with who gets in,"Amina Oyagbola

Too often, gender equity is treated like a destination. We wait until a woman is appointed to a board before we celebrate. We count the number of female directors or commissioners and use that to measure success. But in Nigeria’s workforce, the real story begins much earlier and much lower.

Women make up over 50 per cent of Nigeria’s labour force but hold only 33 per cent of entry-level roles in the formal private sector. That early imbalance creates a bottleneck that persists through every stage of the leadership ladder. The truth is: if women are excluded at the entry point, they never get the opportunity to rise. This isn’t just a case of inequality. It’s a case of lost potential. Companies are limiting their talent pool from day one, and the economy is suffering for it.

The McKinsey report makes it clear. In sectors like finance and health, where women begin strong, the drop-off between middle and senior management is sharp. In health, the representation of women falls by 10 percentage points from manager to senior manager. In finance, the drop is 13 points from entry to senior leadership. Even worse, women who make it to the top often don’t stay. For every 10 women promoted to senior leadership in Nigeria, three leave within a year, a third of them due to workplace bias or blocked career growth. This is not a pipeline that leaks. It’s one that was never properly built.

The problem is not only a pipeline issue. It is a data issue. If 77 per cent of CEOs say gender diversity is a priority, but 33 per cent of companies don’t even track their own numbers, then we are mistaking good PR for good policy. The Nigerian Exchange Group, through the Nigeria2Equal programme with the IFC, is showing what’s possible—publishing gender-disaggregated data, pushing reforms, and becoming the first stock exchange globally to earn EDGE certification for gender equity. Change is possible. But it must scale.

A closer look at the Nigerian Exchange Group’s internal gender metrics from 2021 highlights just how deeply the entry-level challenge runs. Across the NGX Group, women make up only 27 per cent of staff, and in the real estate division, that number plunges to 18 per cent—even though women hold 50 per cent of board seats. Contrast that with the NGX Regulation, where women account for 57 per cent of the workforce. These disparities tell a clear story: achieving gender balance at the top is far easier than building it from the ground up. The structural problem starts at recruitment; if women aren’t hired in the first place, they will never reach leadership.

Fixing this requires rewiring the system. It means setting entry-level gender targets with the same urgency as board quotas. It means publishing disaggregated data on hiring, promotion, and attrition and acting on it. It means building structured mentorship and sponsorship programmes so that women aren’t just admitted but equipped to rise. And it means embedding flexibility and caregiving support into workplace culture, not as perks, but as fundamentals. Women don’t just need opportunities. They need champions. And those champions must be built into the system.

These are not soft measures. They are performance levers. Companies with gender-diverse leadership are up to 25 per cent more likely to outperform financially. Even one more woman in senior leadership is linked to stronger returns. But that won’t happen unless companies shift their focus from the boardroom to the break room.

For so long, corporate Nigeria has treated gender equity like a side project—something to get to after quarterly targets are hit. That’s not just shortsighted. It’s self-defeating. We have spent too long celebrating symbolic breakthroughs. It’s time to focus on structural ones.

And here’s the kicker: Nigeria doesn’t just need more women at the top. It needs more women in the building. Because if you are not hiring women at entry, tracking their growth, or making it possible for them to lead, you are not building an equitable workplace. You are just branding one. And in this economy, the companies that will win are not the ones with the best slogans. They are the ones who opened the door and kept it open.

Surviving the floods: From Mokwa to Abagana,"Greg Odogwu

What happened in Mokwa, Niger State, should not shock us. Rather, it should teach us a lesson that we already know but are too obstinate to assimilate. Climate change is real, and we are not really prepared for the impacts. In another twisted fashion, it is a test for the recently launched Anticipatory Action Framework of the Federal Government, which was unveiled by Vice President Kashim Shettima, designed to shift disaster management “from reactive responses to proactive preparedness by leveraging early warnings, local empowerment, and pre-arranged financing to save lives and livelihoods”.

As a people, we are no strangers to flooding and ecological disasters. But it seems as though after every round of such emergencies, we psychologically shrug off the trauma and move on with our lives. After a while, the IDP camps are unceremoniously shut down and everyone goes back to familiar ground. In fact, some of the victims find their way back to the floodplains that caused the floods in the first place. They rebuild their deluged homes, unpack their silted farms and get back to business in earnest. The country’s emergency agencies roll up their tents and go back to the offices—to wait for the next season of deaths.

I think we have come to the place where we must get off this cycle of deliberate ignorance. This is why I said that Mokwa is a test, and we must not fail. In practical terms, it is the first ecological disaster of note in 2025, just a few weeks after the Federal Government decides to change tactics in flood disaster management.

So, we must ask ourselves, are we ready for the next flood? What are we doing with the Nigerian Meteorological Agency’s seasonal climate prediction for 2025? What can we learn from the Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency’s annual flooding outlook? Have we reviewed the strength of our dams, nationwide?

Indeed, with what we know about climate change, such a disaster will happen again. Climate change has made it such that previously non-flood-prone areas are now at risk. Hence, Mokwa could happen to Amawbia, Amukoko, or Maradun. As the rainy season sets in, climate change ensures that it is more intense than it used to be, such that the volume would inundate the soil, leading to flash floods.

As you read this piece, Abagana, a popular town in Njikoka Local Government of Anambra State, is still reeling from such a flash flood brought about by intense rainfall that visited them on Tuesday, two days ago. Without warning, the roads surrounding the popular Oye-Agu market were taken over by a fast-moving deluge. It swallowed vehicles and halted traffic, chased residents off their homes, and took over the shops at the newly reconstructed commercial hub. Citizens ran helter-skelter as if Armageddon were here, and one wondered what would have become of the town if the rain had lasted a few more hours.

Granted, Abagana was nothing compared to Mokwa, but there is a common denominator in the two ecological situations. The Minister of Water Resources and Sanitation, Prof. Joseph Utsev, in a press briefing in Abuja on Tuesday, said neither Kainji nor the Jebba dams had problems, and did not cause the Mokwa floods. He attributed the flooding to extreme rainfall resulting from climate change and poor urban development planning. He said, “The rain was so much that the town flooded. The town has some urban drainage, but these were all affected because the drainage system was posing some problems with blockages from tributaries and uncontrolled building activities.”

On the same Tuesday, Mr Austyn Nwoye, Managing Director, Njikoka Waste Management, in a statement on his social media handle, detailed the cause of the Abagana flash flood and proffered a solution. “We have assessed the remote cause(s) of that surge and discovered that: 1. People are still loading the gutters (waterways) with waste especially green waste, tree branches cut-off, banana trees harvested and other heavy logs that do not flow (with water) easily. 2. (Neighboring) Dunukofia (Local Government Area) de-silted its gutters in front of former Toronto opposite Capad, and so water flowed freely till it was blocked at the end of the gutter at former Toronto. The spill over is what you see (in the flood).

“Solution: 1. No dumping of waste in the gutters; this is a feat that helps all. 2. The task of environmental awareness and prevention of flooding is not Amaeñe village’s responsibility alone; it is a collective responsibility. When you see an abuse of the waste management policy, call the relevant agencies from either Dunukofia LGA or Njikoka LGA. Report abuse of waterways by anyone. 3. Waste must be tied and dropped at designated collection points and not any other way.”

What we can take away from this week’s revelations is that urban and rural development planning is key to fighting climate change. We must accept the truth that there is no longer anything called ‘village’ anymore, as long as climate change is concerned. Every location, ecosystem or habitat is vulnerable to deluges and flash floods. Every little debris is an enabler of climate impact. What we know as ‘innocent farm waste’ is an ecological trigger. When they block the floodplains, waterways and gutters, the intense rain falls create alternative routes right through the abodes of human beings– be it bungalows, huts, schools, marketplaces, or Skyscrapers, for that matter.

In any case, I still advise the Nigerian government to beam a searchlight on our dams. Dams are built to hold back water and put it to use for irrigation or creating electricity. But around the world, thousands of dams need repair. Many have been too weak to protect local communities amid sustained heavy rains. Last year’s dam disaster in Borno State left us with hundreds of dead citizens; that is why the government was happy to announce that neither of the two dams near Mokwa was to blame for the floods. Yet, we must not be too quick to celebrate.

In 2021, the United Nations University published a report indicating that “tens of thousands of existing large dams have reached or exceeded an ‘alert’ age threshold of 50 years, and many others will soon approach 100 years”. The older a dam gets, the more its foundation can experience a natural process called settling. Slopes surrounding the dam can become unstable, and if the original construction materials start to erode, it can cause seepage. Kainji Dam is 60 years old; Jebba Dam is 40. Our integrity tests should be as rigorous as they are transparent.

Contrary reports about the stability of dams are common around the world. For instance, there were allegations of contrary reports in Brazil after a mining dam in Minas Gerais failed. It collapsed in January 2019, causing a toxic mudslide that killed 270 people– one year after a Brazilian subsidiary of a German risk assessment firm, TÜV SÜD, had certified the dam to be safe.

Meanwhile, our structural engineers and town planning authorities should join the fray in the struggle for environmental sustainability. It is no longer sufficient to just wait for the rainy season to start and then start counting the hazard-prone spots to mobilise our emergency response teams. If the gutters, waterways, conduits, underground channels and shoulder culverts are well designed and managed, there would be fewer flash floods in the cities at such low-risk periods as the onset of rains, as we have presently. This is because we are essentially a country blessed with amenable topography; all we need is innovative thinking and little effort and we are safe on dry ground.

Why Nigeria needs a definition for women-owned businesses,"Agbaidu Jideani

In boardrooms, markets, farms, and digital spaces, Nigerian women are driving enterprise, generating jobs, and sustaining livelihoods.

Despite their contributions, women entrepreneurs still face significant challenges in accessing finance, securing contracts, or qualifying for government support.

One of the major reasons for this is that Nigeria does not have a definition for what qualifies as a women-owned business.

This policy gap has created a silent barrier that limits access to opportunities and leaves millions of women entrepreneurs on the margins of economic growth.

Across Africa, countries that have defined what constitutes a women-owned business have used it to unlock tailored financing schemes, inclusion in public procurement, and gender responsive policy development. In contrast, Nigeria’s lack of clarity creates confusion.

Government agencies, banks, and donors have no standard benchmark to determine who qualifies as a WoB.

As a result, many women fall through the cracks, unable to access the very tools designed to support them.

Without a definition, how can we collect gender-specific business data or design programs that close the persistent inequality gaps?

To address this, the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry, with the support of the Investment Climate Reform Facility, facilitated a landmark dialogue involving government, civil society, women’s business networks, and the private sector.

"Yes, Nigeria can be open defecation-free by 2030","Greg Odogwu

In 2019, former President Muhammadu Buhari signed Executive Order 009, titled “The Open Defecation-Free Nigeria by 2025 and Other Related Matters Order.” With this, the government set its mind on ensuring that no Nigerian would go to the toilet in the open by the year 2025. At that time, 47 million Nigerians engaged in open defecation. Now, we are in 2025, and 46 million Nigerians still defecate in the open. So, the government shifted the goalpost. President Bola Tinubu’s government declared that we shall become open-defecation-free by 2030.

Some people think this is not possible. But I believe some emerging factors could help us achieve this feat. The first is the new status of local government areas in Nigeria. Before now, they did not enjoy financial autonomy, but on July 11, 2024, the Supreme Court delivered a landmark judgment affirming the financial autonomy of the country’s 774 Local government councils. With this, the local governments could strengthen their water governance structures and deploy the necessary investments to improve them.

Water governance relies almost entirely on the local government system. Water governance is the set of systems that control decision-making regarding water management and water service delivery. Simply put, water governance is about who gets what water, when and how.

With their newfound financial independence, local governments, together with key stakeholders, can now design appropriate financial instruments to ensure an adequate income to support proposed investments in the construction of public toilets and the water systems that enable them to keep running sustainably. The provision of water and sanitation services, including operation and maintenance, staff costs and overheads, needs to be financially viable, if not they will only end up as abandoned projects. But when the local governments structure a financial plan that works, including credit and debit control, and microfinance access, it will become a tool for job creation and social enterprise.

Secondly, the most important aspect of this new paradigm is that the local governments can now engage professional manpower to curb open defecation. By law, we are supposed to have government functionaries at the local government level whose primary duty is to inspect public places and people’s homes to ensure that the citizens have properly designed and situated facilities for defecation. But these officers are nowhere to be found because the local government did not have the funds to employ, train and coordinate them.

During the colonial era, they were called sanitary inspectors. Known as ‘wole-wole’ among the Yoruba people, ‘nwaole-ala’ among the Igbos and ‘duba-gari’ among the Hausas, sanitary inspectors were government officials saddled with the responsibility of overseeing the sanitation of houses and neighbourhoods in every part of the country. In those days, they were feared more than the police. Actually, the indigenous Nigerian officers who worked on this duty were sanitary attendants, that is, assistants to the colonialist sanitary inspectors. But the Nigerians eventually progressed to become sanitary inspectors in their own right.

They were in charge of routine sanitary inspection of houses, markets, schools and communities; waste disposal and environmental sanitation, pollution control and industrial sanitation; water sampling and sanitation; port health duties (air, land and seaports); control of communicable disease (infectious diseases); building and urban planning; vector and pest control e.g. malaria control; prosecution of public health offenders in the court; meat and food inspection; the disposal of the dead (corpses); occupational health and factory inspection; vaccination/inoculation of both schoolchildren and adults; and health education on personal and public hygiene.

In 1988, the name of the profession was changed to environmental health officers in line with the internationally accepted name of practitioners of the profession and to accommodate members of the profession who graduated from the university with a degree in public health, environmental health and epidemiology. Now, local governments can afford to employ them to enforce health regulations at local councils.

Nonetheless, the most important thing needed in Nigeria now is political will at the highest level. This is why I call on President Tinubu to declare a state of emergency on the WASH sector, aimed at achieving open-defecation-free status for Nigeria by 2030. The order shall also carry financial implications. There should be massive employment of environmental health officers at the federal, state and local government levels. Their job is to ensure that all public places, including schools, hotels, fuel stations, places of worship, marketplaces, hospitals, and offices, have accessible toilets and latrines within their premises.

Furthermore, the government must make a budget for the nationwide construction of household-owned and community-owned toilets. For instance, when India announced its version of an open defecation-free executive order in 2014, titled “Neat and Tidy India Mission”, the Asian country budgeted a whopping $20bn to achieve the construction of 100 million toilets in rural India in five years.

It is instructive to note that UNICEF said that Nigeria requires approximately 20 million toilets to eliminate open defecation by 2030, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.

There is a reason I chose to refer to India. The country used to be the “open defecation capital of the world,” until it was overtaken by Nigeria in 2019. While it enjoyed the infamous status, India did not just fold its arms. It took deliberate steps to secure a space in the open defecation-free zone of the world; the Indian government decided to turn the tide by introducing what it described as “collective behaviour movement for rural sanitation”.

In 2011, a water, sanitation and hygiene census was conducted in India, which showed that only 32 per cent of its rural households had toilets. But under the Narendra Modi government’s Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission), the WASH situation of the country began to change. The government focused on changing behaviour on a large scale and began implementing the world’s largest rural sanitation drive.

It allocated ample monies and hired the staff to mobilise communities around sanitation, in what is known in the development world as community led total sanitation. According to the Research Institute for Compassionate Economics, popularly known as RICE, half a million community mobilisers – known as Swachhagrahis in India – have been deployed in villages and districts to actualise the government’s vision.

In 2014, PM Modi, after his election, announced the goal of eliminating open defecation by 2019.

Accordingly, the speed with which toilets were being constructed gained momentum. Over 4.5 million toilets were constructed between October 2014 and October 2017. This then jumped to 9.12 million by December 2018. The country’s Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation set up a real-time tracker on its website with a clicker that marked the completion of each toilet. By October 2017, more than 243,000 (of India’s 650,000) villages, 201 out of 677 districts and five of its 29 states had been declared open defecation-free. This then reached 539,000 villages, 580 districts, and 27 states by December 2018, in just 15 months.

Meanwhile, it is important to clarify that the figures reeled out here are independently verified, and not mere government propaganda. It is instructive to note, for instance, that in 2011, before the WASH census was taken in India, the official government website had claimed that 72 per cent of India’s rural households had a toilet. However, an independent census revealed that the true figure was 32 per cent. Feeling challenged, the Indian government surveyed in 2012, the following year, which found that actual toilet coverage was 36 per cent of households.

President Tinubu could become our own Mordi. From 2019 till now, only 135 local governments in Nigeria are open-defecation free. He should take the challenge and give us 90 per cent rural sanitation coverage in five years. All that is required is money and willpower–he has both.

"Yes, Nigeria can be open defecation-free by 2030","Greg Odogwu

In 2019, former President Muhammadu Buhari signed Executive Order 009, titled “The Open Defecation-Free Nigeria by 2025 and Other Related Matters Order.” With this, the government set its mind on ensuring that no Nigerian would go to the toilet in the open by the year 2025. At that time, 47 million Nigerians engaged in open defecation. Now, we are in 2025, and 46 million Nigerians still defecate in the open. So, the government shifted the goalpost. President Bola Tinubu’s government declared that we shall become open-defecation-free by 2030.

Some people think this is not possible. But I believe some emerging factors could help us achieve this feat. The first is the new status of local government areas in Nigeria. Before now, they did not enjoy financial autonomy, but on July 11, 2024, the Supreme Court delivered a landmark judgment affirming the financial autonomy of the country’s 774 Local government councils. With this, the local governments could strengthen their water governance structures and deploy the necessary investments to improve them.

Water governance relies almost entirely on the local government system. Water governance is the set of systems that control decision-making regarding water management and water service delivery. Simply put, water governance is about who gets what water, when and how.

With their newfound financial independence, local governments, together with key stakeholders, can now design appropriate financial instruments to ensure an adequate income to support proposed investments in the construction of public toilets and the water systems that enable them to keep running sustainably. The provision of water and sanitation services, including operation and maintenance, staff costs and overheads, needs to be financially viable, if not they will only end up as abandoned projects. But when the local governments structure a financial plan that works, including credit and debit control, and microfinance access, it will become a tool for job creation and social enterprise.

Secondly, the most important aspect of this new paradigm is that the local governments can now engage professional manpower to curb open defecation. By law, we are supposed to have government functionaries at the local government level whose primary duty is to inspect public places and people’s homes to ensure that the citizens have properly designed and situated facilities for defecation. But these officers are nowhere to be found because the local government did not have the funds to employ, train and coordinate them.

During the colonial era, they were called sanitary inspectors. Known as ‘wole-wole’ among the Yoruba people, ‘nwaole-ala’ among the Igbos and ‘duba-gari’ among the Hausas, sanitary inspectors were government officials saddled with the responsibility of overseeing the sanitation of houses and neighbourhoods in every part of the country. In those days, they were feared more than the police. Actually, the indigenous Nigerian officers who worked on this duty were sanitary attendants, that is, assistants to the colonialist sanitary inspectors. But the Nigerians eventually progressed to become sanitary inspectors in their own right.

They were in charge of routine sanitary inspection of houses, markets, schools and communities; waste disposal and environmental sanitation, pollution control and industrial sanitation; water sampling and sanitation; port health duties (air, land and seaports); control of communicable disease (infectious diseases); building and urban planning; vector and pest control e.g. malaria control; prosecution of public health offenders in the court; meat and food inspection; the disposal of the dead (corpses); occupational health and factory inspection; vaccination/inoculation of both schoolchildren and adults; and health education on personal and public hygiene.

Endometriosis: Getting the right diagnosis for targeted relief,"Abayomi Ajayi

Endometriosis treatments range from drugs to surgery. It’s debated if surgery is better than drugs or the reverse. Assisted reproduction helps too. The goal is to ease pain, reduce other issues, and help with getting pregnant. The best treatments combine drugs, surgery and assisted reproduction and this helps with pain and infertility if pregnancy is desired. What is important is to get the right diagnosis.

Generally, treatment revolves around three modalities. The choice depends on whether pain or infertility or both is the main target. Treatment often starts with a good diagnosis. Your doctor will ask about your pain and when it happens. A pelvic exam is often next. The doctor then checks for problems like cysts or scars. Small endometriosis spots can be hard to find. This is true if there are no cysts, and an ultrasound can help at this point. Although it might not show endometriosis, it can find cysts or scars caused by it.

An MRI can also be used, and laparoscopy allows doctors to look inside your belly. It can provide information about the location, extent, and size of the endometrial implants. Your surgeon may take a tissue sample (biopsy) for further testing.

Often, with proper surgical planning, the surgeon can fully treat endometriosis during the laparoscopy, so that you need only one surgery. Laparoscopy is the most common surgical procedure employed for the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis. It is a minor surgical procedure performed under general anesthesia, or in some cases, under local anesthesia. It is usually performed as an outpatient procedure (the patient does not stay in the facility overnight).

During laparoscopy, biopsies (removal of tiny tissue samples for examination under a microscope) can also be performed to obtain a tissue diagnosis. Sometimes random biopsies obtained during laparoscopy will show microscopic endometriosis, even though no implants are visualised. You may take an over-the-counter pain reliever to help ease painful menstrual cramps, and also take hormonal therapy in combination with pain relievers if you’re not trying to get pregnant. Drugs, including hormonal contraceptives, may be prescribed to help control the hormones responsible for the buildup of endometrial tissue each month. As the diagnosis of endometriosis can only be definitively confirmed with a biopsy.

Since endometriosis occurs during the reproductive years, many available medical treatments rely on the interruption of the normal cyclical hormone production by the ovaries. Drugs known as Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRH analogs) have been effectively used to relieve pain and reduce the size of endometriosis implants. These drugs suppress estrogen production by the ovaries by inhibiting the secretion of regulatory hormones from the pituitary gland. As a result, menstrual periods stop, mimicking menopause.

Surgical treatment for endometriosis can be useful when the symptoms are severe or there has been an inadequate response to medical therapy. The surgery may be conservative, in which the uterus and ovarian tissue are preserved; or definitive, which involves hysterectomy (removal of the uterus), with or without removal of the ovaries. Conservative surgery is typically performed laparoscopically.

But for several reasons, neither the symptoms nor the physical examinations can be relied upon to conclusively establish the diagnosis. Imaging studies, such as ultrasound, can help rule out other pelvic diseases and may suggest the presence of endometriosis in the vaginal and bladder areas, but they cannot reliably diagnose endometriosis. For an accurate diagnosis, a direct visual inspection inside the pelvis and abdomen, as well as a tissue biopsy of the implants used to be the Holy Grail but now the concept of clinical endometriosis is becoming more common (diagnosis without surgery).

Endometriosis can lead to trouble conceiving. If you’re having difficulty getting pregnant, fertility treatment ranges from stimulating your ovaries to making more eggs for IVF. The right treatment for you depends on your situation. If you have endometriosis and you are trying to become pregnant, preserving your eggs may increase your chances of success. If you have severe pain from endometriosis, you may also benefit from surgery.

However, endometriosis and pain may return. Pain is physical and emotional with endometriosis. It is normal to feel anxious, sad and stressed, especially with the pain that comes first even before the infertility issues. You need to be aware that not all women with endometriosis are infertile. Many women have children without difficulty before they are diagnosed, and eventually have a successful pregnancy. You may be among women ready to have children but can’t get pregnant and as a result have feelings of frustration and hopelessness. However, getting pregnant with endometriosis is possible, though it may not come as easily as expected, but it happens.

The most effective per-cycle treatment for endometriosis-related infertility depends on your age, stage of the disease, infertility risk factors and personal choice. Your treatment plan will also depend on the stage of your endometriosis and whether endometriosis alone is the cause of your infertility. Finding a doctor with whom you feel comfortable is crucial in managing and treating endometriosis. It helps to obtain a second opinion before starting any treatment to be sure you know all of your options and the possible outcomes. The bottom line is that while endometriosis is a serious and uncomfortable condition, the good news is that help is available.

FGM: Urgent actions needed to end the evil,"Eustace Okere

Among the socio-cultural anomalies in Nigeria and many parts of Africa, female genital mutilation remains topmost, despite the many wars to stamp out the tide. Unarguably, the justification for this practice is often rooted in the assumption that it enhances a woman’s prospects for marriage and has the tendency to reduce promiscuity, among others. Ironically, this practice has no health benefits and has continued to harm girls and women in many ways, according to the World Health Organisation.

The WHO has posited that FGM encompasses all procedures that involve the partial or total excision of external female genitalia or any other form of injury to the female genital organs conducted for non-medical purposes. This practice is not only painful but also puts the girl-child at risk of health challenges. Yet, it serves as a valid reason to sack women from their marital homes or subject them to other ill-treatments, should they dare to raise objections to the circumcision of their daughters.

Globally, this practice is recognised as a grave violation of the fundamental human rights of women and girls. This underscores the need to question the efficacy of the Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act in Nigeria.

The VAPP Act, which came into effect on May 25, 2015, represents the first federal legislation aimed at prohibiting FGM nationwide. This Act seeks to eradicate gender-based violence in both private and public spheres by criminalizing and prescribing penalties for offences such as rape (excluding spousal rape), incest, domestic violence, stalking, harmful traditional practices, and FGM.

Unfortunately, many of these practices are not even reported to the police because many of the women often fear jeopardising their marriages by involving law enforcement against their husbands’ families. In a typical Nigerian setting, taking such a step can lead to the husband divorcing his wife, which can have profound psychological and social effects on the woman.

In Nigeria, where it is common for women to take on the primary responsibility of caring for the children while the husbands work, this situation can also create significant financial challenges. The woman’s dependence on her husband’s income makes her more vulnerable, as a divorce could leave her without financial support.

Additionally, the societal stigma surrounding divorced women exacerbates the issue, as Nigerian society often views a woman who is no longer in her husband’s home as unworthy of marriage, regardless of the circumstances. This harsh judgment, coupled with financial insecurity and emotional distress, can ultimately lead to depression as the woman struggles with isolation, economic hardship, and the pressure of societal expectations.

In recent findings, many women have continued to face coercion, predominantly from in-laws, to subject their daughters – regardless of whether they are teenagers or toddlers – to this harmful practice.

The coercion manifests in various forms, including physical assaults, threats, verbal harassment, and financial oppression, ultimately compelling most women to yield to the demands of their family members. The fear of possible outcomes even compels some of these women to either hide their identities while speaking to journalists on issues of this nature or outrightly decline comments. This shows the level of fear, coercion and psychological dispositions of the majority of the women.

Moving around the South-East, South-West, South-South and other parts of Northern Nigeria, news abound on this topical cultural issue.

In a 2022 publication by the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund on FGM in Nigeria, about 19.9 million women were survivors of this practice, which ranked Nigeria the third highest in the number of women and girls who have undergone FGM worldwide. Most of the affected victims were aged 0-14. This figure has continued to appreciate unabated over the years.

Of truth, the above scenario is almost non-existent in Western climes because FGM is unequivocally prohibited with stringent legal repercussions, including custodial sentences for perpetrators. Consequently, some affected women seek asylum in these nations, viewing them as the safest environments where they can shield their daughters from such inhumane practices.

Conversely, while some Nigerian laws criminalise FGM, almost every region has continued to prioritise entrenched traditional customs over statutory laws. In some cases, groups of people and family members push for a particular course of action, and with this pressure and minimal support from any source, the victim is left with no options. Additionally, in certain situations, affluent and well-connected individuals reportedly compromise law enforcement officers, leaving victims without legal recourse.

It, therefore, becomes imperative to intensify advocacy by all well-meaning individuals against this ugly situation. Compulsory and effective education can also help to curtail this practice. More so, serious women empowerment is needed to reduce the overdependence on husbands, making the women capable of standing up for their daughters against this ugly situation.

2050: Ex-envoy warns of looming food crisis,"Tukur Muntari

Former Nigerian Ambassador to Ghana and Mauritania, Bala Sani, has warned that Nigeria, among other countries, will face a food crisis and dwindling resources as the world population is projected to double by 2050.

He said experts have projected that the population doubles every 25 years, hence the world population could reach 16 billion, up from the current eight billion.

The diplomat spoke in Kano during the United Nations Pact for the Future Summit Step Down Workshop held at Maryam Abacha American University of Nigeria, Kano, on Friday.

The programme was organised by the United Nations Fact for the Future Consortium in collaboration with the university.

He, however, lamented that adequate planning has not been made in terms of resources to cater to the growing population.

“Experts say the population doubles every 25 years. So we are eight billion now, and by the year 2050, we will be 16 billion people.

“Some countries have already adopted family planning techniques, but not in Africa and Asia. Some European countries do so, however,” he said.

On how Nigeria could turn its population into a blessing as it is projected to be the third most populous country by 2050, the former Ambassador said the country should adopt some of the bigger populations’ policies like China, to suit its situation.

“We have to apply the law of the situation. There are many factors which we have to take into account in feeding our people.

“For instance, the IMF and the World Bank are saying the government has to remove all subsidies to settle debts. But this is economics, but politically it is dangerous”, he said.

One of the workshop organisers and founder, MECIN Consults, Dr. Khadija Gumbi, said the event will inform people on issues discussed and adopted at the United Nations.

Gumbi, who is a lecturer at BUK, explained that the workshop stepped down the training to Kano to gather all like minds together and acquaint them with the pact’s contents ahead of the United Nations General Assembly in September.

“We are way behind the line in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which is just five years to end, but we have not made a lot of the impact that the pact of the future is important.

“We adopt that global common agenda. And, the gap is due to the lack of involvement of individuals at the grassroots level,” he said.

Also speaking, founder of Da Hausa Literacy Initiative, Laila Gumbi, said the summit of the future was an outcome of the UN summit last year, where countries signed three important documents, one of which is the Pact of the Future.

“We, as a consortium, found it important to bring this information to more people, because not everybody went to the UN to hear these things. And most of the time, when things are signed on our behalf, we may not have the opportunity to read the document to know what was signed on our behalf,” Laila Gumbi added.

MAAUN president, Prof. Mohammad Israr, thanked the organisers for choosing his institution to host the event, saying that it serves as a platform to share knowledge and ideas on ways of making progress and innovation in the world.

2050: Ex-envoy warns of looming food crisis,"Tukur Muntari

Former Nigerian Ambassador to Ghana and Mauritania, Bala Sani, has warned that Nigeria, among other countries, will face a food crisis and dwindling resources as the world population is projected to double by 2050.

He said experts have projected that the population doubles every 25 years, hence the world population could reach 16 billion, up from the current eight billion.

The diplomat spoke in Kano during the United Nations Pact for the Future Summit Step Down Workshop held at Maryam Abacha American University of Nigeria, Kano, on Friday.

The programme was organised by the United Nations Fact for the Future Consortium in collaboration with the university.

He, however, lamented that adequate planning has not been made in terms of resources to cater to the growing population.

“Experts say the population doubles every 25 years. So we are eight billion now, and by the year 2050, we will be 16 billion people.

“Some countries have already adopted family planning techniques, but not in Africa and Asia. Some European countries do so, however,” he said.

WHO raises the alarm as malnutrition crisis deepens in Gaza,"Rotimi Agbana

The World Health Organisation has sounded the alarm over a worsening malnutrition crisis in the Gaza Strip, where a sharp spike in preventable deaths—especially among children—has underscored the dire impact of limited access to food, health care, and humanitarian aid.

WHO made this known in a statement via its official X account on Sunday.

“Of 74 malnutrition-related deaths in 2025, 63 occurred in July—including 24 children under five, a child over five, and 38 adults. Most of these people were declared dead on arrival at health facilities or died shortly after, their bodies showing clear signs of severe wasting.

“The crisis remains entirely preventable. Deliberate blocking and delay of large-scale food, health, and humanitarian aid has cost many lives”, the health agency’s statement began.

According to the UN health agency, acute malnutrition is surging among Gaza’s youngest, with nearly one in five children under five in Gaza City now affected.

It lamented that the situation has sharply deteriorated in just a matter of weeks.

“Nearly one in five children under five in #Gaza City is now acutely malnourished, as reported by Nutrition Cluster partners. Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM), which measures the percentage of children aged 6–59 months suffering from acute malnutrition, has tripled since June, making it the worst-hit area in the Gaza Strip.

“In Khan Younis and the Middle Area, rates have doubled in less than one month. These figures are likely an underestimation due to the severe access and security constraints preventing many families from reaching health facilities”, it lamented.

WHO also revealed that over 5,000 children under five were treated for malnutrition in the first two weeks of July alone, with nearly one in five suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition, the deadliest form of the condition.

It added, “So far in July, over 5,000 children under five have already been admitted for outpatient treatment of malnutrition in just the first two weeks, 18% of them with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM), the most life-threatening form. This continues a significant rising trend since May, with 6500 children admitted for treatment in June, which is the highest number recorded since October 2023.”

The health system, already under enormous strain, is struggling to cope with the rising caseload. Only four specialised treatment centres for malnutrition exist in the entire Gaza Strip, and all are stretched beyond capacity.

“An additional 73 children with SAM and medical complications were hospitalized in July, compared to 39 in June, bringing total inpatient admissions in 2025 to 263.

“This surge in cases is overwhelming the only four specialised malnutrition treatment centres in the Gaza Strip, pushing an already fragile health system closer to collapse.

“All four centres are working beyond capacity, running low on fuel, with their supplies expected to run out by mid-next month.

“Health workers are exhausted, and the breakdown of water and sanitation systems is accelerating the spread of disease, driving a dangerous cycle of illness and death”, the statement continued.

WHO explained that women are also among the most affected.

The agency’s data indicates that more than 40% of pregnant and breastfeeding women in the region are now severely malnourished, especially in areas where food and health access have been most restricted.

“The crisis is taking a severe toll on pregnant and breastfeeding women. Recent Nutrition Cluster screening data show that over 40% are severely malnourished.

“The situation is most critical in the Middle Area, where rates have tripled compared to June, and in Gaza City and Khan Younis, where they have doubled,” WHO stated.

The ongoing crisis is not only a matter of hunger but also the dangerous conditions people are forced to navigate just to access food. Since May 27, over 1,000 individuals have reportedly been killed and thousands more injured in the pursuit of food.

“It is not only hunger that is killing people but also the desperate search for food. Families are being forced to risk their lives for a handful of food, often under dangerous and chaotic conditions.

“Since 27 May, more than 1060 people have been killed and 7200 injured while trying to access food”, it further stated.

WHO has called for an urgent, large-scale response to prevent further loss of life, including consistent delivery of food, medical supplies, and essential services.

“WHO calls for urgent, sustained efforts to flood the Gaza Strip with diverse, nutritious food and to expedite the delivery of therapeutic supplies for children and vulnerable groups, as well as essential medicines and supplies.

“This flow must remain consistent and unhindered to support recovery and prevent further deterioration”, it urged.

In its closing remarks, the agency reiterated its broader appeals for civilian protection, access for health services, and a political resolution to end the violence.

“WHO reiterates its call for the protection of civilians and health. WHO also calls for the release of our detained colleague, the release of hostages, and for an immediate #ceasefire”, the statement concluded.",https://healthwise.punchng.com/who-raises-the-alarm-as-malnutrition-crisis-deepens-in-gaza/,https://punchng.com

"Global hunger: UN lists Nigeria, 12 others at risk of catastrophic famine","The United Nations has expressed concerns over worsening hunger conditions in several parts of the world, naming Nigeria and 12 other countries as hunger hotspots facing an imminent risk of famine if urgent humanitarian interventions are not undertaken.

In a new report titled ‘Hunger Hotspots’ released on Monday, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Programme identified countries experiencing the most severe levels of food insecurity, warning that conflicts, economic shocks, and climate-related disasters are driving millions towards starvation.

The report projected that food crises will deepen over the next five months unless access to aid is urgently expanded and humanitarian operations are adequately funded.

Among the countries flagged, Gaza, Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti, and Mali were listed as being at the highest risk of slipping into famine-like conditions, with the UN noting that the situation in these regions has reached critical levels.

The UN agencies warned that without increased global support, the humanitarian efforts currently underway could falter due to growing insecurity and significant funding gaps.

Nigeria was listed among countries of very high concern, alongside Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Myanmar, and others.

The report cited ongoing armed conflict, displacement, inflation, and insecurity as key factors exacerbating food shortages across affected regions, including parts of Nigeria.

Although the situation in Nigeria is not yet classified as a full-blown famine, the UN noted that without sustained humanitarian access and livelihood support, millions could face catastrophic hunger in the coming months.

To declare a famine officially, at least 20 per cent of a population in a defined area must be suffering from extreme food shortages, 30 per cent of children must be acutely malnourished, and two out of every 10,000 people must be dying daily due to starvation or malnutrition-related disease.

In Sudan, where famine was confirmed earlier in 2024, conflict has displaced millions and disrupted agriculture, putting almost 25 million people at risk of severe food insecurity.

The WFP warned that the crisis in Sudan is far from over and could deteriorate further as violence continues unabated. South Sudan, also battling the dual threats of political instability and devastating flooding, could see up to 7.7 million people plunged into a food crisis, with at least 63,000 already enduring famine-like conditions.

Similarly, in Gaza, continued Israeli military operations and a sustained blockade have left the entire population of 2.1 million people facing acute food insecurity, with nearly 500,000 people projected to be on the brink of famine by the end of September.

The report also highlighted Haiti, where escalating gang violence and displacement have left thousands without access to food.

About 8,400 people are already facing catastrophic hunger, the highest level on the UN’s Integrated Food Security Phase Classification scale.

In Mali, rising conflict and spiking grain prices are projected to push at least 2,600 people into famine-like conditions by the end of August.

WFP Executive Director, Cindy McCain, described the situation as a red alert, stating that the international community knows where hunger is rising and who is most at risk, but is being hampered by a lack of funding and access.

“Without funding and access, we cannot save lives,” she said.

The report called for immediate investment in life-saving assistance and stronger efforts to enable aid deliveries.

It also urged support for agricultural resilience to help affected communities continue food production despite adversity.

FAO Director-General, QU Dongyu, emphasised the importance of protecting people’s farms and livestock, noting that sustaining food production amid crisis conditions is not only urgent but essential.

While the global hunger outlook remains bleak, the report noted that some countries, such as Ethiopia, Kenya, and Lebanon, have shown improvement and have been removed from the FAO-WFP watchlist.

"Nestlé, FG to boost milk production","Princess Etuk

The Federal Government, in partnership with Nestlé Nigeria, has unveiled a transformative initiative aimed at equipping Nigerian farmers with the technical skills needed to boost milk production and improve livelihoods.

The collaboration was announced on Monday at the signing of a letter between Nestle Nigeria and Ministry of Livestock Development in commemoration of World Milk Day 2025.

The initiative is designed to tackle critical challenges in the dairy value chain by developing mid-level vocational skills in dairy farming.

The programme will also provide practical training in areas such as milk production, processing, hygiene, and farm management, with the aim of improving both the quality and quantity of milk produced in Nigeria.

Speaking at the event, the Livestock minister, Mukhtar Maiha said, “Since the establishment of the Federal Ministry of Livestock Development, we have taken significant steps to address the challenges facing the dairy value chain.

Under the National Livestock Growth Acceleration Strategy, we are focusing on key pillars, including livestock value chain development and feed and fodder improvement.

“Our collaboration with Nestlé Nigeria will lead to the commissioning of a Dairy Training Centre in Paikon Kore, Gwagwalada, aimed at building mid-level manpower and training farmers to enhance productivity through modern practices.”

Also speaking at the signing ceremony, Managing Director and CEO of Nestlé Nigeria Wassim Elhusseini, emphasized the strategic importance of the collaboration.

“In addition to our global dairy experience, Nestlé has built capacity to provide targeted training programs on best practices in dairy farming adapted to the Nigerian context.

“This is why the Letter of Intent signifies more than a formal agreement; it reflects our mutual dedication to bridge the gap in mid-level technical skills within the dairy sector to meet the growing demands of the market.

“We are confident that this will have a positive impact on our communities by creating more jobs, improving livelihoods, and supporting a stronger economy,” he said.

Elhusseini, emphasised that Nestlé Nigeria’s contribution to dairy development began in 2019 with the launch of its Dairy Development Project.

Since then, the company has established 83 dairy cooperatives, directly benefiting more than 3,000 milk producers. And he also said that Over 1m liters of raw milk have been aggregated, and over 2,000 milk producers have been trained in best practices.

The company has also vaccinated nearly 37,000 cattle and constructed infrastructure including 19 boreholes and 28 water troughs to improve water access.

The impact of these efforts has been substantial. Rejection rates for milk dropped from 12 per cent in 2021 to 5 per cent in 2024, while average monthly revenue for milk producers has surged from N70,000 in 2019 to N250,000 in 2024.

Recently, Nestlé unveiled its Dairy Demonstration Farm, a model designed to showcase how improved practices can raise milk yields from 1 liter to over 10 liters per cow per day.

The success of this model prompted the Minister to invite Nestlé to convert the demonstration farm into a training institute, an invitation Nestlé enthusiastically accepted.

Borno Assembly to criminalise diversion of malnourished children’s food,"Isah Ojo

The Borno state House of Assembly has said it will criminalise the diversion and reselling of malnourished children’s food following the disturbing alarm raised by the United Nations Children’s Fund.

The House made the pledge on Friday when UNICEF visited its committee on health to discuss possible collaborations on the Federal government’s N-774 project, which focused on addressing issues of malnutrition in the country.

While expressing grievances over the reselling and diversion of malnourished children’s food, the Chairman of the state’s House of Assembly Committee on Health, Maina Mustapha, assured UNICEF of collaboration to deliver its mandate of protecting children’s health through stringent regulations that will deter the selling of healthcare donated items.

“We will criminalise the issue of selling out, taking, or theft of nutrition products that is being supplied by donor partners.

“We claim we are poor and resort to selling whatever has been given to us by donor partners.

“Instead for us to use it for our children, we choose to use it for our personal gain,” Mustapha said.

PUNCH Healthwise had recently reported that UNICEF raised the alarm over the diversion and reselling of RUTF, a product meant for over half a million malnourished children in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe states.

Speaking on the N-774 initiative, Mustapha appreciated UNICEF’s involvement, while stating that it is ready to carry it along in all the planning and strategies.

The UNICEF Chief of Maiduguri Field Office, Joseph Senesie, commended the partnership, saying with the right political will through the N-774 initiative, children in grassroots areas will enjoy access to good nutrition.

He said, “N-774 is an initiative, launched by the government of Nigeria, headed by the Vice President, and the N-774 represents all the local governments in Nigeria, meaning it’s for the whole country, where nutrition will go right down to the grassroots level.

“The agenda is to bring down issues relating to malnutrition.

“In Borno state, we are meeting here at the House of Assembly to ensure that the initiative that started at the national level is coming down to the sub-national level.

“This is why we are calling ours the end N-27, since that is the number of LGAs in the state. We want to have committee members and form the committee that will represent all these LGAs so that nutrition is taken down to the grassroots.”

He commended the house for the bold step to criminalise the diversion of products meant for malnourished children, while describing it as the right step in the right direction

“In Borno state, we are meeting here at the House of Assembly to ensure that the initiative that started at the national level is coming down to the sub-national level.

“This is why we are calling ours the end N-27, since that is the number of LGAs in the state. We want to have committee members and form the committee that will represent all these LGAs so that nutrition is taken down to the grassroots.”

He commended the house for the bold step to criminalise the diversion of products meant for malnourished children, while describing it as the right step in the right direction

Canada commits $10m to halt malnutrition in five northern states,"Haruna Usman

The Global Affairs Canada Initiative operating in Nigeria has disclosed that it has committed 15 million Canadian dollars to halting the malnutrition scourge among women, adolescents and children in Kebbi, Bauchi and Kaduna states.

The sum, which is equivalent to $10.7m US dollars, was provided to Kebbi and two other states to strengthen Gender-Responsive Sexual Reproductive Health Rights and Nutrition Services in the state.

PUNCH Healthwise reports that UNICEF is providing technical support, while the state government will implement the programme through Primary Health Centres.

The UNICEF Chief Field Officer, Sokoto, Mr Michael Juma, told participants at a training workshop in Birnin Kebbi, on Tuesday, that the objective was to enable target beneficiaries have access to quality health care and nutrition services, with emphasis on women, adolescent girls and children.

According to him, “Since the focus is on impactful health delivery system, there’s a need for a functional coordination structure for success.

“We want Universal Health Coverage all pervading whereby no single child is left behind.”

Meanwhile, Juma acknowledged the hard work of Governor Nasir Idris in improving the quality of health care delivery in Kebbi State, including the recent recruitment of 500 professional health workers.

A facilitator and Canadian Health Manager, Mr Martin Dohlsten, in his remark, disclosed that the intervention programme funded by Canada would function for five years.

“Kebbi, Kaduna, and Bauchi are the three states selected in Nigeria as recipients of the funds for implementation of the health scheme.

“The financing is 15 million Canadian dollars, equivalent to $10.7 US dollars for maternal health and the newborn for the three states,” Martin added.

Meanwhile, the Kebbi State Commissioner for Health, Yunusa Isma’il, and the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Dr Shehu KoKo, in separate remarks, affirmed the commitment of the incumbent administration of Governor Nasir Idris to make healthcare delivery accessible and affordable to all communities in the state.

The Commissioner thanked the Canadian Government for its monetary intervention in improving the health status of Kebbi residents.

“Governor Nasir Idris has placed a premium on the improvement of the health sector, in addition to the sizeable budgetary allocation to health services. He has also ensured unfettered access to healthcare for women, children, and the vulnerable.

“Last year, he renovated 14 major health facilities in the state, recruited 500 health professionals who received training and retraining to update their knowledge,” Isma’il disclosed.

However, Koko informed the audience that priority has been attached to primary health and human resource development.

“The incumbent administration of Nasir Idris has revitalised several Primary Health Centres, and before December this year, 191 more PHCs will also undergo rehabilitation,” Koko assured.

The two-day training of health practitioners and journalists held at Azbir hotels in Birnin Kebbi would, at the end of the day, improve the implementation capacity of health workers drawn from the Ministry of Health, Kebbi State.

UNICEF laments diversion of malnourished children’s food in N’East,"Isah Ojo

The United Nations Children’s Fund, on Tuesday, raised the alarm over diversion and reselling of RUTF, a food meant for over half a million malnourished children in Borno, Adamawa State.

The organisation described the act as ‘going out of hand’ and may result in the death of many underage children.

Speaking with journalists in Maiduguri during a one-day meeting with stakeholders in the state, the UNICEF Chief of Maiduguri Field Office, Joseph Senesie, said the diversion is been carried out by workers, transporters and traders.

He said, “The issue is going out of hand, where either traders, transporters, and some workers have been found involved or caught for misusing or diverting supplies, which is a major issue to UNICEF.

“We have done investigations to know what is happening, and we have found it is happening online and in the market. We believe law enforcement agents should do their work to ensure these free commodities go to the right children.”

According to him, UNICEF is targeting more than half a million children with the supplies in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe states.

While speaking on the effect of the product diversion, Senesie said, “For a child to die because the product meant for them is stolen is alarming to us. This problem is huge, we all know how insecurity, food insecurity and everything is affecting families and those who are displaced, so for those selling these commodities, you are depriving the children and they are going to die, and not only that, we will not have resources for those who really needs it, donors will stop.”

Senesie urged stakeholders to contribute their efforts in advancing the rights of malnourished children.

“We want everyone, such as the law enforcement agencies, to do their work. We want action from the government to ensure that transporters do not transport nutrition commodities without a waybill, traders do not sell, and buyers should not buy because it is free. We want action from health workers not to sell or divert these supplies. We want action from everyone,” he noted.

He also called on the media to support the organisation in advocating children’s rights and support its campaign against the diversion of supplies.

Senesie also urged security agencies in the state to return any confiscated supplies from those diverting them to the state government to prevent them from expiring.

“When the police station confiscates these supplies, it should come back to the Ministry of Health for it to be used and not to be in police stores,” he added.

"FG unveils N2.9bn health initiative to reduce maternal, newborn deaths","Lara Adejoro

The Federal Government has begun the nationwide distribution of essential maternal and child health commodities as part of renewed efforts to reduce maternal and newborn deaths.

The distribution was coordinated by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency in collaboration with development partners in Abuja on Tuesday.

The PUNCH reports that the Maternal and Neonatal Health commodities distributed were worth N2.9bn across 10 states.

According to the United Nations Children’s Fund, Nigeria’s figures show a maternal mortality rate of 576 per 100,000 live births, the fourth highest on Earth.

Each year, approximately 262,000 babies die at birth, the world’s second-highest national total. Infant mortality currently stands at 69 per 1,000 live births, while for under-fives it rises to 128 per 1,000 live births.

It said more than half of the under-five deaths – 64 per cent – result from malaria, pneumonia, or diarrhoea.

Investment in this sector has been high in recent years, although the proportion of patients able to access appropriate treatment remains low.

The Federal Government’s new initiative is therefore seen as a critical step to bridge gaps, reduce stock-outs, and give frontline health workers the tools they need to save lives.

Speaking at the flag-off in Abuja, the Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of the NPHCDA, Muyi Aina, stressed that the initiative was designed to save lives, close service delivery gaps, and support states in strengthening primary healthcare systems.

According to Aina, reducing maternal and newborn deaths remains a pressing national priority.

He explained that the first phase will target 21 categories of essential maternal and neonatal health commodities, to be distributed first across 10 states, Bauchi, Borno, Ebonyi, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Niger, Plateau, Yobe, and Zamfara.

The distribution of MNH commodities will cover a total of 1,936 primary healthcare facilities across 80 Local Government Areas nationwide.

The rollout is being implemented by zones to ensure equitable access and prioritisation of high-need areas.

In the North West Zone, 940 Primary Health Centres in 44 LGAs are set to benefit, while the North East Zone will cover 756 PHCs in 29 LGAs.

The North Central Zone will receive supplies in 124 PHCs across five LGAs, and the South East Zone will benefit from 116 PHCs in two LGAs.

“We need to remind ourselves that our mothers and our newborns deserve better. Too many women die needlessly from preventable causes,” he stated.

The ED added that commodities are being delivered alongside training for health workers, equipment supply, and infrastructure upgrades to ensure quality care for mothers and newborns.

While the Federal government is providing leadership, he stressed that sustainability depends on states and local governments.

“The states have the primary responsibility for service delivery. This is an intervention by the Federal Government to fill some gaps and show the kind of difference they can make, so that states will take it on,” he said.

Aina acknowledged Nigeria’s maternal mortality figures remain unacceptably high and often underreported.

“Regardless of where you look, too many women die needlessly from preventable causes.

“Whether you cite a figure of 500 or more per 100,000 live births, the truth is that even 10 is uncalled for.”

He said the government will begin annual tracking of maternal mortality to refine strategies, “If our strategy is working, we double down. If it’s not working, we pivot as appropriate,” he added.

On sustainability, Aina disclosed that agreements had been reached with States to ensure continuity, “Part of the reason why it’s taken us a bit of time to push this out is we wanted that commitment from states that they are going to make this sustainable.

“The funding for these commodities should come from that level,” the ED explained, noting that planning for the next phase of distribution has already begun.

The representative from the World Health Organisation, Mary Brantwo, described the commodities as tools of hope, dignity, and survival that represent a shared commitment to safeguarding mothers and newborns.

Brantwo commended NPHCDA for ensuring that supplies reach the communities where they are most needed.

“This handover is a testament to the power of partnership, and to the progress that is possible when we align our efforts with national priorities and global standards,” she noted.

The representative from the United Nations Population Fund, Achu Lordfred, said the intervention aligns with UNFPA’s focus on preventing maternal deaths, promoting family planning, and ending gender-based violence.

He highlighted recent support for life-saving interventions such as heat-stable carbetocin, which reduces maternal deaths and expressed hope the commodities would “accelerate progress in reducing maternal and newborn deaths in our frontline facilities.”

ISMPH pushes for media involvement in reduction of maternal deaths,"Angela Onwuzoo

To reduce maternal mortality and improve pregnancy outcomes in Lagos State, the International Society of Media in Public Health has trained journalists in the state on maternal health reporting, reiterating that no woman should die while giving birth.

ISMPH explained that credible and factual health information by the media enables pregnant mothers and women to connect with it meaningfully and make informed decisions about their health.

The NGO also stressed the need for media professionals to prioritise effective communication anchored on evidence when reporting maternal and newborn health, family planning, sexual and reproductive health, adolescent health, gender, and gender-based violence.

Maternal health is the health of a woman during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period.

Speaking at a two-day training programme for traditional media and social media influencers in Lagos recently, ISMPH Executive Director, Moji Makanjuola, urged journalists to increase their reportage on maternal health to improve pregnancy outcomes.

The journalists were trained on reporting Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent Health and Nutrition, gender, gender based violence, family planning, and the enrollment into health insurance.

The event was organised by ISMPH and CCSI in collaboration with Engender Health Consortium to reduce maternal and infant deaths through improving media literacy around maternal health topics and to build the capacity of reporters to drive community-level change through informed reporting.

The training is part of a three-year pilot project spanning Lagos, Kano, and Kaduna, to improve RMNCAH+N outcomes through media awareness.

Represented by ISMPH Director of Programmes, Mr.Solomon Dogo, Makanjuola pointed out that through its agenda setting, the media plays a critical role in health policy and public perception by disseminating health information, promoting health behavours, framing public health debates, and influencing public opinion.

By presenting health-related information, Makanjuola, a veteran journalist, maintained that media content could alter individuals’ beliefs, attitudes, and perceived social norms regarding health behaviours.

She told the participants that a well-told story, grounded in truth and sincerity, resonates deeply with audiences.

Additionally, she said the media should ensure that their reports on maternal health are human-centred and devoid of sensationalism and speculations, stressing that by humanising the stories, they foster relatability and build connections.

According to her, to produce effective maternity-related health information, mothers’ viewpoints must be incorporated.

Health information serves as a vital resource that can be communicated through various media channels to effectively enhance health outcomes .

The United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals underscores the importance of access to pertinent health information as a foundational element for enhancing the economic, political, and social well-being of communities.

According to the UN, this access enables individuals to make informed decisions about their health, fosters greater community engagement, and ultimately contributes to more resilient societies.

Thus, providing mothers with timely and relevant health information helps them to make informed decisions, which is essential in reducing pregnancy-related complications that may lead to low maternal and child mortality.

Makanjuola said the capacity training was held to bring health journalists together to promote reproductive health awareness and reduce the maternal mortality rate in Lagos State.

“We want to see the indices reduced every day. A lot of women and children are dying out there. We need the media to strategically change the narrative by pushing out the right information.

“The media is a strategic partner in healthcare. We encourage pregnant women to go for antenatal care and deliver in primary healthcare facilities rather than at home.

” We also want increased enrollment in health insurance. Also, we are looking at child spacing”, the ISMPH executive director said.

Although the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.1 targets the reduction of the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by the year 2030, Nigeria is behind the worldwide target due to its high maternal mortality rate.

Already, Nigeria has an alarming maternal mortality rate of 512 per 100,000 live births, according to the NDHS 2018.

Also speaking, ISMPH Gender and Social Inclusion Expert, Olamide Olaniyan, in his various presentations at the programme, said the media could place health issues on the public and political agenda, catalyzing national and local action to address these problems.

He urged participants to apply the insights gained from the training to change the narrative of maternal health in Lagos State.

Akwa Ibom doctors face sanction over pregnant woman’s death,"Patrick Odey

Three doctors at the Ikot Ekpene General Hospital in Akwa Ibom State are under scrutiny following the death of a pregnant woman, Ndiana Amos, and her baby, allegedly caused by medical negligence.

The House of Assembly Committee on Health directed the Ministry of Health and the state Hospitals Management Board, to apply disciplinary action against the medical personnel following its investigations on the cause of Amos and her baby’s death.

Chairman of the Committee and member representing Ibiono Ibom State Constituency, Moses Essien, issued the directive during a meeting with the Commissioner for Health, Dr Ekem John, and top officials of the ministry and hospital board at the Assembly complex on Thursday.

The deceased reportedly died alongside her baby last weekend following alleged medical negligence, according to a viral video posted online by her sister.

The footage had triggered widespread outrage across the state, prompting Governor Umo Eno to order a probe into the incident.

Following an unscheduled fact-finding visit to the hospital on Monday, the committee concluded that negligence, not lack of resources, was responsible for the tragedy.

The committee said its findings revealed that the first doctor on call, Dr. Mfon Thomas, had documented the patient’s condition, suspected to be placenta previa, and sought a second opinion from Dr Enobong Udota, who was absent.

Another medical doctor, Dr EtoroAbasi Okon, who was not on duty, was eventually contacted but arrived about two hours late.

It said the Consultant Obstetrician and Gynecologist, Dr Ekerette Dan, the third doctor on call, was never informed of the emergency.

“By the time surgery was performed, the baby had already died. Although the mother was initially stabilised post-surgery, she succumbed to excessive bleeding shortly after,” the committee noted.

Disturbed by the findings, Essien vowed that the Assembly would not rest until sanctions were imposed on those responsible.

He directed the health commissioner to take responsibility and make necessary recommendations to the governor.

He described the incident as a “preventable tragedy” and blamed it on professional lapses by on-duty staff.",https://healthwise.punchng.com/akwa-ibom-doctors-face-sanction-over-pregnant-womans-death/#respond,https://punchng.com

The House of Assembly Committee on Health directed the Ministry of Health and the state Hospitals Management Board, to apply disciplinary action against the medical personnel following its investigations on the cause of Amos and her baby’s death.

Chairman of the Committee and member representing Ibiono Ibom State Constituency, Moses Essien, issued the directive during a meeting with the Commissioner for Health, Dr Ekem John, and top officials of the ministry and hospital board at the Assembly complex on Thursday.

The deceased reportedly died alongside her baby last weekend following alleged medical negligence, according to a viral video posted online by her sister.

The footage had triggered widespread outrage across the state, prompting Governor Umo Eno to order a probe into the incident.

Following an unscheduled fact-finding visit to the hospital on Monday, the committee concluded that negligence, not lack of resources, was responsible for the tragedy.

The committee said its findings revealed that the first doctor on call, Dr. Mfon Thomas, had documented the patient’s condition, suspected to be placenta previa, and sought a second opinion from Dr Enobong Udota, who was absent.

Another medical doctor, Dr EtoroAbasi Okon, who was not on duty, was eventually contacted but arrived about two hours late.

It said the Consultant Obstetrician and Gynecologist, Dr Ekerette Dan, the third doctor on call, was never informed of the emergency.

“By the time surgery was performed, the baby had already died. Although the mother was initially stabilised post-surgery, she succumbed to excessive bleeding shortly after,” the committee noted.

Disturbed by the findings, Essien vowed that the Assembly would not rest until sanctions were imposed on those responsible.

He directed the health commissioner to take responsibility and make necessary recommendations to the governor.

He described the incident as a “preventable tragedy” and blamed it on professional lapses by on-duty staff.",https://healthwise.punchng.com/akwa-ibom-doctors-face-sanction-over-pregnant-womans-death/,https://punchng.com
"I was screaming inside, Lady shares coma ordeal after miscarriage","Christabel Ndoeche

A woman identified as @dorothytuash on TikTok has opened up about her harrowing experience after waking up from a medically induced coma.

The lady, who previously revealed that she lost her 23-week-old pregnancy, said she was placed in a coma for four days after developing septic shock, a severe and life-threatening complication of infection.

In an earlier video posted on the 24th August, she shared how doctors had given her only a 50 percent chance of survival, describing her recovery as nothing short of miraculous.

In a recent video on the 31st of August, Dorothy narrated the strange and distressing sensations she experienced while unconscious, explaining that although her body was unresponsive, her mind and soul were very much aware of her surroundings.

“When I tell you that being in a coma is one of the worst things you can ever experience, do not recommend, believe me, when I say so,” she said.

“I bet you didn’t know that when you are in a coma, you could hear everything that is going on around you. You could hear people talking about you.”

“It’s enough to traumatise a human being. Now, everyone’s experience in a coma is different. A lot of people just black out; they don’t even know what happened. But me, I was conscious and I knew a lot of the things that were happening around me.”

She added that she could feel pain but was unable to react or communicate.

“Not only that, I could feel pain. I had like 10 IVs in my arm, and when they turned me over, I felt it, and I was screaming inside.”

“There was even a time when one of my IVs blew up, like my arm was swollen, and they had to pump it out. They were squeezing my arms, and I was dying a little bit inside every time.”

Dorothy said the medically induced coma was necessary to administer life-saving treatments for her condition.

“So the reason why I was in a coma was because I had septic shock, and they had to put me in a coma so that they could administer all the treatments and all the IVs for me,” she explained.

“When I found out I was in a coma, it was the worst experience of my life. I was panicking in there, and there was no way of signalling to the outside world. And you can hear what is going on, you can feel the pain, and you are still in there, you are conscious, but they don’t know.”

“Luckily for me, I was in and out. Sometimes, I would come to, and when I get super anxious, with everything that is going on, and I start to panic inside, I black out again.”

“And apparently, I was crying a lot when I was in the coma, and it’s because I knew what was going on. And then every time they would open my eyes, I would see, but there was no way I could tell them any of that.”

Dorothy’s testimony sheds light on the often-overlooked condition of septic shock, a critical medical emergency that occurs when a severe infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure and organ failure.

Without prompt treatment, it can be fatal.

According to Healthdirect (Australian government health agency), “Sepsis is a medical emergency. If you suspect you or someone else has sepsis, … symptoms may include fast breathing, fever, confusion, severe pain, discoloured skin and drowsiness. Sepsis can lead to septic shock, organ failure or death if not treated quickly.”

Individuals experiencing these symptoms, especially after childbirth, surgery, or a major infection, are advised to seek immediate medical care.

Her story not only highlights the silent terror of being conscious but immobile during a coma, but also serves as a reminder of the importance of medical intervention and awareness about sepsis and septic shock.

World Suicide Prevention Day 2025: Hope over silence confronting suicide in Nigeria,"

Every year, the world comes together on September 10th to mark World Suicide Prevention Day. This year’s theme is ‘Changing the Narrative on Suicide,’ and for us here in Nigeria, that theme couldn’t be more timely.

Nigeria’s Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare reports that around 15,000 Nigerians die by suicide each year, and suicide now ranks among the top causes of death for young people aged 15 to 29. The question is no longer ‘if’ we should talk about it, but ‘how’.

Today, we’re sitting down to have that conversation to break the silence, confront the stigma, and most importantly, to ask what can be done to bring hope and healing to those who need it most.",https://tv.guardian.ng/world-suicide-prevention-day-2025-hope-over-silence-confronting-suicide-in-nigeria/,https://guardian.ng

The siren problem in Nigeria,"

In Nigeria today, the wailing of sirens no longer depicts an emergency situation. It is now being used as an instrument of intimidation and occasionally as a display of prestige.

According to the National Road Traffic Regulation of 2012, only top governmental officials, like the President, Vice-President, governors, and the emergency response team, are allowed to make use of sirens and beamers.

However, in modern reality, we see people like businessmen, entertainers etc, with armed escorts making use of sirens.

Sadly, the penalty is as minimal as 3000 Naira, which we know can’t do anything to deter offenders.

Nigeria’s Shea export ban: Unlocking a $3 Billion industry,"

Nigeria produces an estimated 350,000 metric tonnes of shea nuts annually across 30 states, accounting for nearly 40% of the world’s supply. Yet, the country captures less than 1% of the $6.5 billion global shea market, largely due to exporting unprocessed nuts and losing over 90,000 tonnes yearly to informal cross-border trade. This ban, effective immediately, aims to change that by securing raw materials for local processors, who currently operate at just 35 to 50% capacity despite a national potential of 160,000 tonnes.",https://tv.guardian.ng/nigerias-shea-export-ban-unlocking-a-3-billion-industry/,https://guardian.ng

Kogi youths suspend protests against banditry after lawmaker’s intervention,"Following the intervention of Senator Sunday Karimi, who represents the Kogi West Senatorial District, and with the support of the Chairman of Yagba West Local Government (LG) and other key stakeholders, the three-day youth protests in Yagba West Local Government Area of Kogi State have been suspended.

Thousands of youths had taken to the streets in Egbe, the commercial hub of Yagba West LGA, protesting the recent murders of three policemen and two vigilantes, who bandits brutally killed. The protests quickly spread to other areas within Yagba West LG.

Although Senator Karimi is currently out of the country, he has maintained communication with heads of security agencies, the leadership of the Yagba West Council, traditional leaders, and community representatives. His intervention followed a statement he issued from abroad, empathising with the protesters and urging calm. He reassured them that serious efforts are underway by the government and security agencies to address the situation.

Senator Karimi engaged directly with the leadership of the protesting youths, addressing them twice. He called for an end to the roadblocks and assured them that security forces are working diligently to bring the perpetrators to justice while securing lasting peace and safety for the community. The youth leaders expressed their gratitude to the senator for taking the time to communicate with them despite being abroad, and for his relentless efforts both in the Senate and in his commitment to restoring peace in Egbe. They asked to meet with their members to share the outcomes of the discussions and promised to honour the senator’s commitments by dismantling the roadblocks.

As a result, about two hours ago, the protesting youths removed the roadblocks on the highways, extinguished burning tires, and allowed the free movement of vehicles that had been stranded along the Ilorin-Egbe-Isanlu-Kabba road since the protests began on Wednesday.

The protests, which had halted commercial activities in the area for about 48 hours, have now concluded, and normal daily routines have resumed. Senator Sunday Karimi remains committed to voicing the concerns of his constituents and ensuring their safety. He empathises with their grief and dissatisfaction and has consistently advocated for a lasting solution on the floor of the Senate and through his oversight responsibilities.",https://guardian.ng/news/nigeria/metro/kogi-youths-suspend-protests-against-banditry-after-lawmakers-intervention/,https://guardian.ng
Ibas inaugurates new governing councils for four state-owned tertiary institutions,"Rivers State, Sole Administrator, Vice Admiral (Rtd.) Ibok-Ete Ekwe Ibas, has inaugurated the newly appointed chairmen and members of the Governing Councils for four state-owned tertiary institutions.

The newly constituted councils are for the Rivers State University (RSU), Ignatius Ajuru University of Education (IAUE), Captain Elechi Amadi Polytechnic, Rumuola, and Kenule Benson Saro-Wiwa Polytechnic, Bori.

The inauguration ceremony took place on Thursday at the Executive Chambers of Government House, Port Harcourt. Ibas charged the councils with a mandate to transform the institutions into premier centres of academic excellence, innovation, and technical prowess.

In his address, he described the event as a reaffirmation of the government’s unwavering commitment to education as the cornerstone of sustainable development and the empowerment of the people of Rivers State.

Addressing the councils of Rivers State University and Ignatius Ajuru University of Education, the Administrator highlighted their unique place in the state’s academic and developmental landscape.

“Over the years, they have produced men and women who have contributed immensely to public service, industry, and innovation both within and beyond our borders,” he stated, also praising the institutions’ lecturers for their outstanding contributions.

He charged the new councils to provide strategic leadership by ensuring sound policy direction, accountability in management, and the creation of an enabling environment for teaching, learning, and cutting-edge research. While acknowledging challenges such as infrastructure, funding, and global competitiveness, Vice Admiral Ibas insisted they could be overcome with “vision, dedication, and integrity.”

“A university is not an ivory tower. It is a living engine of social and economic growth,” he emphasised, urging them to embrace transparency, inclusiveness, and forge robust partnerships with the private sector, development agencies, and international institutions.

Turning to the governing boards of Captain Elechi Amadi Polytechnic and Kenule Benson Saro-Wiwa Polytechnic, the Administrator stated that their inauguration underscored the state’s determination to strengthen Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) as a critical driver of industrial growth and socio-economic transformation.

“These polytechnics, named after our most illustrious sons, stand as symbols of resilience, vision, and progress and have produced skilled graduates who contribute meaningfully to our industries, institutions, and communities,” he noted.

He charged the boards to uphold the highest standards of discipline, excellence, and integrity. He tasked them with promoting policies to expand access to technical education, improve infrastructure, enhance staff and student welfare, and foster a culture of innovation.

The administrator assured all the newly inaugurated councils of the state government’s commitment to providing the necessary resources and policy direction to ensure their success. He encouraged them to strengthen partnerships and attract investments to position all four institutions as leading hubs of innovation in Nigeria and beyond.",https://guardian.ng/news/ibas-inaugurates-new-governing-councils-for-four-state-owned-tertiary-institutions/,https://guardian.ng
"Ondo govt hands over teaching hospital to FG, approves roads in 18 councils","Ondo State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Hon. Idowu Ajanaku flanked by other commissioners during the briefing.

The Ondo State Government has approved the transfer of the University of Medical Sciences (UNIMED) Teaching Hospital complex in Akure to the Federal Government for use as the College of Medicine and Teaching Hospital of the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA).

The decision, ratified at the State Executive Council (SEC) meeting chaired by Governor Lucky Aiyedatiwa, will see the state-owned facility provide core infrastructure for FUTA’s newly approved medical college and teaching hospital.

Briefing journalists after the SEC meeting, Commissioner for Health, Dr. Banji Ajaka, said the transfer became necessary following President Bola Tinubu’s approval for FUTA to establish its own medical college.

Ajaka explained that the handover would involve a full transfer of assets and staff, adding that all hospital employees would be absorbed by the federal management.

“The handover includes the transfer of staff, infrastructure, equipment, and liabilities. All employees will be absorbed into FUTA Teaching Hospital under the Federal Government,” he said.

“This development will strengthen healthcare delivery in Ondo State while advancing FUTA’s ambition to become a leading centre for medical sciences in Nigeria.”

Commissioner for Information, Mr. Idowu Ajanaku, also announced that each cabinet member has been directed to nominate a road project in their respective local council areas as part of efforts to promote equitable development across the state.

“These roads are outside the 2025 budgeted projects. They are supplementary interventions aimed at improving connectivity and directly impacting communities,” Ajanaku said, stressing that the initiative is not for private or partisan interests.

In addition, Commissioner for Agriculture and Forestry, Leye Akinola, revealed new measures to protect farmers from the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which prohibits the importation of crops grown on deforested land.

He said the state would adopt agroforestry practices in selected forest areas, enforce strict mapping and traceability systems, and support farmers with permits to continue operations.

“By December 30, 2025, any crop that cannot be traced to a mapped farm risks rejection in the EU market. To safeguard livelihoods, the state will support farm mapping and grant farmers permits to continue operations,” Akinola said.

The council also approved a review of tariffs on agricultural produce and timber across the value chain to align Ondo with other Southwest states under the DAWN Commission framework.",https://guardian.ng/news/ondo-govt-hands-over-teaching-hospital-to-fg-approves-roads-in-18-councils/,https://guardian.ng
Job seekers protest alleged fake employment letters for Ondo teaching jobs,"Hundreds of aggrieved job seekers on Friday staged a protest at the Governor's Office, Alagbaka, Akure, the Ondo State

Hundreds of aggrieved job seekers on Friday staged a protest at the Governor’s Office, Alagbaka, Akure, the Ondo State capital, over alleged fake letters of employment issued to them for teaching positions in the state.

The protesters, who had applied for teaching jobs under the state’s civil service, barricaded the entrance to the Governor’s Office while demanding immediate inclusion in the ongoing biometric capturing exercise for newly recruited teachers by the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB).

According to the protesters’ claims, despite possessing ‘official-looking’ appointment letters purportedly issued by SUBEB and the State Teaching Service Commission (TESCOM), their names were not included in the official list of successful candidates scheduled for the exercise.

While armed with placards of various inscriptions, the job seekers chanted solidarity songs and called on the state government to intervene.

A source said, “The affected members of the newly recruited teachers in Ondo State are protesting their disengagement from the capturing exercise due to backdoor appointment letters issued to them by unscrupulous directors of the personnel at SUBEB and TESCOM offices.”

In a reaction, the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Ebenezer Adeniyan, confirmed that the protesters had been scammed with fake appointment letters by some unknown people.

“People should please note that those who protested are not teachers but applicants who were duped by some individuals during the recruitment process.

“They all paid money to scammers who issued them fake letters of appointment.

“Those legitimately recruited by the government have been absorbed and have started working,” the CPS stated.

The government, however, maintained that the genuine recruitment exercise is being handled transparently and urged applicants to be wary of fraudsters exploiting the process.",https://guardian.ng/news/nigeria/metro/job-seekers-protest-alleged-fake-employment-letters-for-ondo-teaching-jobs/,https://guardian.ng
Rights group condemns killing of four mourners in Anambra,"Rights group, Foundation for Environmental Rights Advocacy & Development (FENRAD), has condemned the Thursday killing of four mourners and the injury of 15 by gunmen during a burial at Ezi, Ogidi, Anambra State.

Consequently, the group called for a declaration of a state of emergency.

The call was included in a statement issued on Friday evening by the Executive Director of the group, Nelson Nnanna Nwafor.

Nwafor described the incidents as a gross failure of the government to fulfil its constitutional duty of protecting lives and property, and also urged that a panel of inquiry should be established to investigate the ongoing killings.

The statement read: “The barbaric incident, which occurred on Thursday, 11th September 2025, has again highlighted the gross failure of the government to fulfil its constitutional duty of protecting lives and property.

“A trending video on social media captured some of the injured victims receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital.

Eyewitnesses said the gunmen stormed Ezi Village, Ogidi, on Thursday and opened fire on unsuspecting mourners, turning the solemn event into a bloodbath.”

FENRAD disclosed that police, in a statement by the state command’s spokesperson, Tochukwu Ikenga, had confirmed that it was a fracas between rival cult groups.

The group regretted that despite repeated appeals by various bodies and individuals on the ways to curtail the incessant killings, it appeared that the various tiers of government were not implementing the recommendations.

“FENRAD notes with dismay that despite repeated warnings, appeals, and policy recommendations by civil society, the state and federal governments have failed to implement decisive measures to curb the growing insecurity in Anambra. This consistent failure is costing innocent lives and eroding public confidence in governance.

“As such, FENRAD urgently calls for: A formal declaration of a state of emergency on killings and insecurity in Anambra State.

“Deployment of joint federal security forces with a clear mandate to neutralise armed groups and restore peace.

“An independent judicial panel of inquiry to investigate the massacre and prosecute those responsible.

“Comprehensive compensation, trauma care, and medical treatment for all victims and their families.”

Community policing, FENRAD said, would yield results. “We reiterate longstanding advocacy for comprehensive community-based policing as laasting solution to insecurity in Anambra and the Southeast. This must be rooted in local intelligence, trust, and collaboration between communities and trained security personnel.

“Our current security model has clearly failed. We must shift to a community policing approach that empowers local stakeholders, enhances intelligence gathering, and fosters swift response.”

The body consoled the families of the victims, standing in solidarity with them.

Nwafor advised: “The organisation urges all levels of government to rise above politics and act decisively to end the bloodshed.”",https://guardian.ng/news/nigeria/metro/rights-group-condemns-killing-of-four-mourners-in-anambra/,https://guardian.ng
"NNPC targets vulnerable farmers to end food crisis, trains 6,000","The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) is taking a bold step beyond its traditional oil and gas operations by targeting 6,000 vulnerable farmers for training in modern agriculture techniques, as part of a nationwide effort to address food insecurity and reduce reliance on imports.

Over 75 per cent of the country’s farmers operate on a subsistence basis, producing primarily for household consumption with little surplus to sell.

Low productivity, weak infrastructure, and insecurity have all contributed to persistent food inflation, which in turn fuels the cost-of-living crisis.

The initiative is being spearheaded by the NNPC Foundation, which says the programme is designed to move farmers away from subsistence-level production and enable them to farm profitably and sustainably.

At the official flag-off of the programme for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and Nigeria Cluster in Abuja, Managing Director of NNPC Foundation, Emmanuella Arukwe, said the decision to embark on the initiative was driven by the need to address rising food inflation, unemployment, and weak productivity in the agricultural sector.

“The initiative focuses on addressing food insecurity, a critical issue in Nigeria. By training farmers across the six geopolitical zones, the project targets increasing local food production, thus reducing reliance on food imports and enhancing national food security,” Arukwe said.

She explained that the foundation started the programme earlier in the year in the southern geopolitical zones and successfully concluded training there before moving to the North Central zone.

The current phase covers Kogi, Kwara, Benue, and the FCT, with other zones to follow.

Arukwe identified the key challenges facing smallholder farmers, including lack of access to quality seedlings, poor yields, limited tools, post-harvest losses, transportation constraints, and a lack of knowledge about climate-smart agricultural practices.

These challenges, she said, prevent farmers from increasing productivity and improving their livelihoods.

“We believe that by improving the agricultural practices of Nigeria’s local farmers, we can increase their productivity, which directly contributes to better income and livelihoods for their families and lifts them from subsistence to commercial-scale farming,” she noted.

The training is expected to cover areas such as improved seed varieties, efficient water management, soil health, mechanisation, pest control, and year-round planting techniques.

The aim is to build capacity for sustained food production while helping farmers adapt to the impacts of climate change.

Arukwe stressed that the approach is designed to have a multiplier effect, enabling trained farmers to share their knowledge with others in their communities.

“Rather than provide food to feed people in the short term, it is better to teach them how to produce food and achieve lasting impact and sustainability,” she said.

Also speaking at the event, Mandate Secretary for Agriculture and Food in the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), Ibrahim Yaro, said agriculture has the potential to solve about 60 per cent of the country’s social challenges, especially poverty and unemployment.

However, he warned that without consistent intervention and proper follow-through, efforts like these could lose momentum.

He urged the beneficiaries to take the training seriously and apply what they learn to improve productivity.

Yaro also cautioned them against misusing the starter packs that will be distributed at the end of the programme, saying such tools should be invested back into their farms.

He commended the NNPC Foundation for prioritising training over direct cash handouts, which he said often fail to create lasting impact.",https://guardian.ng/features/agro-care/nnpc-targets-vulnerable-farmers-to-end-food-crisis-trains-6000/,https://guardian.ng
"Women affairs minister alleges plot against ministry, female leaders","The Honourable Minister of Women Affairs, Hajiya Imaan Sulaiman-Ibrahim, has raised alarm over what she described as a coordinated attempt to undermine the Ministry of Women Affairs and her leadership as a female political office holder.

Speaking at a press briefing in Abuja on recent clashes between management and staff, Sulaiman-Ibrahim described the protests and criticisms against her as part of a wider scheme to discredit the Women’s Ministry and women in leadership.

“There’s an attack on the Ministry of Women Affairs and on female politicians, and they are trying to use the staff against the ministry,” she declared.

She stressed that the resistance she faces is not just about her person but part of a broader assault on women in leadership.

“We are fighting for positions for women, and they are fighting me as a woman. But we will not give up,” she said.

Days earlier, ministry workers openly booed the Minister during a protest, accusing her of neglect, arrogance, and poor leadership.

According to staff, the ministry has been starved of basic work tools, including stationery, while the Minister reportedly maintains over 25 Special Assistants.

Addressing staff concerns, the Minister acknowledged their complaints but clarified the limits of her role as the political head of the ministry.

“All you are complaining about, I know about it, and I always consent to the ones I can. But you want me to be the Permanent Secretary, HR, and Director of Finance. Everyone has their role,” she explained.

She emphasised that her mandate is focused on political advocacy and policy direction, while administrative duties fall under the purview of the Permanent Secretary and Directors. She called for mutual respect, trust, and collaboration to move the ministry forward.

“We should all be human beings first before anything else. I appeal for unity and urge every staff to focus on the bigger picture of women’s struggle in governance,” she added.

Sulaiman-Ibrahim warned that internal conflict only strengthens those working against the ministry’s mandate.

“If we do not do things properly, we will be our own enemies of progress. People only align where there is peace. We can still solve our problems without harassing each other,” she cautioned.

The Minister also lamented what she described as deliberate sabotage of her efforts to reposition the ministry, citing withheld memos and blocked initiatives. Nonetheless, she reassured staff of her commitment to their welfare and to the ministry’s mandate.

Concluding, she reminded them that the Ministry of Women Affairs is the “conscience of the country,” with a broad responsibility for women, children, families, and vulnerable groups. She urged all staff to uphold its integrity.

The Minister’s remarks came just two days after staff of the ministry staged a protest at its headquarters in Abuja, calling for her redeployment. At an interactive session on Thursday, workers reiterated their grievances.

Union Chairperson, Anne Orjiobele, criticised poor communication and exclusion of professionals from program planning.

“The ministry’s programme should be communicated to the entire staff and run by professionals. Today, officers on level 10 do not even know what is happening. In the past, we were carried along, but now we are not,” she said.

Child Protection Officer, Abdusalam Abdulaziz, lamented the absence of staff quarters despite the ministry’s decades-long existence.

“In 1995, after the Beijing Convention, came the freedom of Women Affairs. This year makes it 30 years, but we still don’t have staff quarters. Some of us travel four hours daily from Keffi to get to work. If you can address this, it will solve 50% of our problems,” he said.

Other staff highlighted welfare, training, and retirement challenges. Peter from the Research Department appealed for laptops and timely payment of repatriation allowances.

“Some of us taught ourselves computer skills because we could not access training or devices. Also, those retiring face fear of the unknown. If allowances are paid promptly, it will ease their transition,” he explained.

A widow in the ministry, Mrs. Bumi Oni Obadje, pleaded for inclusion and compassion.

“We, the widows in the ministry, do not benefit from the things the Minister does for widows outside. I lost my husband in November and faced bullying from his family. I came to the ministry for help, but I did not get your attention, ma’am. Please come to the widows’ aid and hear our cries. Money is not everything sometimes, we just need words of encouragement,” she said emotionally.

For persons with disabilities, Principal Admin Officer, Daniel Isiwe, complained about exclusion.

“We have an association of staff with disabilities. Our basic need is inclusion, accommodation, and access. In the ministry, these are still challenges,” he said.

Staff also lamented that for two years the ministry had not organised International Women’s Day, its flagship event.

The meeting ended with both sides reaffirming their commitment to dialogue, though tensions remain between the management and staff of Nigeria’s apex ministry for women and vulnerable groups.",https://guardian.ng/news/nigeria/national/women-affairs-minister-alleges-plot-against-ministry-female-leaders/,https://guardian.ng
Ingentia to lower oil production costs as NUPRC converts licence,"As Nigeria’s upstream petroleum sector yesterday in Abuja marked the conversion of Petroleum Prospecting Licence (PPL) to Petroleum Mining Lease (PML), the first such conversion under the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), indigenous producers, Ingentia Energies Limited, said the cost of oil production per barrel could come down to a single digit.

The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), at the signing ceremony, said investor confidence is returning to the industry as more wells are being drilled.

Speaking at the event, NUPRC Chief Executive, Gbenga Komolafe, described the conversion as “historic” and a significant step in the implementation of the PIA.

“PML 66 is the very first petroleum mining lease to be converted from a petroleum prospecting licence awarded under the 2020 Marginal Field Bid Round.

“This milestone follows the successful commercial discovery of hydrocarbons in the field and its subsequent conversion, in line with Section 81(1) of the Petroleum Industry Act. This development clearly demonstrates the value of the bid round and the resilience of Nigeria’s upstream oil and gas industry,” Komolafe said.

Komolafe added that the conversion shows the Commission’s commitment to transparency, consistency, and efficiency in its regulatory mandate.

“More importantly, this milestone sends a strong signal to domestic and international investors that Nigeria remains a destination of choice for oil and gas investments, anchored on regulatory clarity, commercial viability, and operational excellence,” he stated.

The holders of PPL 202 — Suntrust Oil Company Nigeria Limited, Petrogas Energy Trade West Africa Limited, Somora GTB Limited, MoR Oil Exploration & Production Nigeria Limited, and Genesis Hydrocarbons Limited — were commended for their diligence and commitment to fulfilling their work programme, which paved the way for the conversion.

Ingentia Energies Limited, incorporated in 2022 as a joint venture between the five licensees, operates the Egbolom Field, a swamp marginal field located in the Central Niger Delta Basin. The field, discovered in 1982 and formerly part of OML 23, lies about 12 kilometres from the Ogbele terminal and 18 kilometres north-east of the Soku Field.

Ingentia’s Managing Director, Olajumoke Ajayi, hailed the PML conversion as a turning point for the company.

“Being the first among the 2020 marginal field awardees to convert to a PML is a great feat,” she said.

Ajayi disclosed that Ingentia currently produces about 7,000 barrels of oil per day and has plans to boost production significantly by the end of October.

“Our rig is already on its way to location. We have two wells to drill back-to-back, each expected to deliver between 2,000 and 2,500 barrels per day. By the first quarter of next year, we expect to increase our production to about 7,500 barrels per day,” she said.

The company also revealed that it is constructing its own crude evacuation facility, a move expected to slash production costs and improve operational efficiency.

“Once our dedicated evacuation facility is completed, our cost of production per barrel will come down substantially. This is part of our broader plan to remain competitive and sustain production growth,” Ajayi explained.

She credited the Commission for its support, stating that NUPRC’s guidance had been critical to Ingentia’s success.

“At several points, we called upon the Commission, and they stood by us without hesitation, and that is what has made this achievement possible,” she said.

Ajayi also thanked the host community for their cooperation, stressing that Ingentia is committed to ensuring the benefits of the project extend beyond shareholders.

“We are committed to delivering jobs, capacity building, and technology transfer that will benefit our host community and Nigerians at large,” she said.

Speaking at the signing ceremony, Board Chairman Valentine Ugbeide described Ingentia’s journey as one “built on vision, partnership, and perseverance,” crediting the company’s progress to the synergy among its partners, the dedication of its staff, and the guidance of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC).

Ugbeide reported that Ingentia is currently averaging 2,300 barrels of oil per day (bopd) and is focused on further development of the asset to boost production and contribute to Nigeria’s hydrocarbon output. He emphasised the importance of continued collaboration with host communities, the Rivers State Government, and regulators, noting that stakeholder engagement will remain a priority.

He also acknowledged the support of the President, the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources, and industry regulators, adding that the company is determined to play a meaningful role in advancing the country’s energy future.",https://guardian.ng/news/ingentia-to-lower-oil-production-costs-as-nuprc-converts-licence/,https://guardian.ng
Lagos govt to raise N214.8b through bond in five days,"The Lagos State government announced on Friday plans to raise N214.8 billion through bonds within five days.

This was made public during a bond issuance event, titled “Investment Forum and Engagement with Mr. Governor,” organised by the Lagos State Ministry of Finance and the Debt Management Office (DMO) in Lagos.

Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who spoke passionately about bridging the state’s infrastructure deficit gap, said that the N214.8 billion is small, especially when considering inflation, the exchange rate, the rising cost of projects, and the infrastructure gaps in the state.

He revealed that the cost of projects has more than doubled compared to what the state government usually spends on the same project four to five years ago.

The total bond issuance, amounting to N214.8 billion, is divided into two categories: N200 billion in 10-year bonds aimed at 24 infrastructure projects across nine ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs).

The MDAs include housing, health, environment, agriculture, transportation, and innovation, science & technology. The second bond is a N14.815 billion green bond.

The governor said it is the first of its kind by a sub-national government in Nigeria, and the state government undertook this initiative after several efforts to raise green bonds internationally did not materialise.

Sanwo-Olu stated that the green bond proceeds will be utilised for environmentally sustainable initiatives, including renewable energy, climate change adaptation, and sustainable water and wastewater management.

Also speaking at the event, the CEO of ChapelHill Denham, Bolaji Balogun, the lead issuing house, said that they hope to close the deals within five days and make the proceeds from the bond issuance to the state government within the next two weeks.

“Lagos is first among peoples, among the sub nationals, not only in this country, but on this continent, that we feel confident pushing the envelope and asking the investing markets to work with us to raise 200 billion naira of capital,” he said.",https://guardian.ng/news/nigeria/metro/lagos-govt-to-raise-n214-8b-through-bond-in-five-days/,https://guardian.ng
Ebonyi bans illegal motor parks,"The Ebonyi State Government has banned all illegal motor parks operating within the capital city, effective Monday, September 15, 2025.

The Commissioner for Capital City and Urban Development, Chief Sunday Elechi Inyima, disclosed this to journalists in Abakaliki after a joint meeting with the Commissioners for Transport, Market and Park Development, Environment, and the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Transport.

Chief Inyima stated that the move was part of efforts to properly regulate transportation activities in the city and ensure order in public spaces.

“We have agreed that all illegal parks within the capital city will be shut down. Starting Monday, announcements will be made through the media to inform the public about government-approved parks.

“Any other loading points outside those approved will not be tolerated,” he stated.

He explained that bus shelters were designed only as waiting points for commuters and not as loading bays, stressing that indiscriminate loading in unauthorised locations was a major cause of disorder in the city.

The commissioner listed the four designated parks approved by the state government as Eze Igboke Ewa Central Park, opposite the Margaret Umahi International Market; Chris Nwankwo Park (formerly Ishieke Park); Akanu Ibiam Park (also known as Building Materials Park); and EBOTRANS Terminal.

Chief Inyima assured that further details of the enforcement exercise would be made public later.",https://guardian.ng/news/nigeria/metro/ebonyi-bans-illegal-motor-parks/,https://guardian.ng
Nepal ex-chief justice Karki becomes next PM after protests,"Sushila Karki will be the new Prime Minister of Nepal

Nepal’s former chief justice Sushila Karki was sworn in Friday to lead the transition as the country’s next prime minister after deadly anti-corruption protests ousted the government.

The 73-year-old Karki, Nepal’s first woman chief justice, was sworn into office by President Ram Chandra Paudel, after the previous prime minister quit Tuesday as parliament was set ablaze.

“Congratulations! We wish you success, wish the country success,” Paudel said to Karki after the small ceremony in the presidential palace, attended by diplomats and some former leaders.

The Himalayan nation of 30 million people was plunged into chaos this week after security forces tried to crush rallies by young anti-corruption protesters.

At least 51 people were killed in the worst violence since the end of a civil war and the abolition of the monarchy in 2008.

The military took back control of the streets on Wednesday, enforcing a curfew.

The appointment of the judge, known for her independence, comes after two days of intense negotiations by army chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel and Paudel, including with representatives from “Gen Z”, the loose umbrella title of the youth protest movement.

Thousands of young activists had used the online app Discord to debate the next steps — and name Karki as their choice of next leader.

Karki, dressed in a red sari dress, took the oath but did not make a further speech. She smiled and bowed with her hands pressed together repeatedly in traditional greetings.

“It is a moment of victory… finally the power vacuum has ended,” said Amrita Ban, a Gen Z protester.

“We did it”, key youth protest group Hami Nepal posted on Instagram, calling for unity.

“Honour the lives of those who sacrificed themselves for this moment”.

Presidential press advisor Kiran Pokharel told AFP that “a council of ministers will be formed after, and other processes will be taken from there”.

– ‘Make a better Nepal’ –

Protests fed into longstanding economic woes in Nepal, where a fifth of people aged 15-24 are unemployed, according to the World Bank, with GDP per capita standing at just $1,447.

At least 21 protesters were among those killed, mainly on Monday during the police crackdown on demonstrations against corruption and poor governance that was sparked by a ban on social media.

Parliament, major government buildings and a Hilton Hotel were among the sites set ablaze by protesters on Tuesday.

KP Sharma Oli, the 73-year-old leader of the Communist Party, then quit as prime minister. His whereabouts are not known.

More than 12,500 prisoners who escaped from jails across the country during the chaos “are still at large”, police spokesman Binod Ghimire told AFP.

Nepal’s army said it had recovered more than 100 guns looted in the uprising, during which protesters were seen brandishing automatic rifles.

Soldiers patrolled the largely quiet streets of the capital Kathmandu for a third day on Friday.

“I was very afraid, and stayed locked inside my home with family and didn’t leave,” said Naveen Kumar Das, a painter-decorator in his mid-40s.

He was among many ordinary residents of Kathmandu who took advantage of a brief lifting of the curfew to stock up on supplies.

James Karki, 24, who was among the protesters, said he was hopeful for change ahead.

Market leader decries get-rich-quick syndrome among youths,"The Chairman of the Wuse Market Traders Association in Abuja, Mr Okorie Ikechukwu-Raphael, has decried the ‘get-rich-quick’ syndrome among the teeming population of youths in the country.

Speaking to reporters in Abuja on Friday, he urged citizens, especially young people, to embrace hard work and resist the temptation of shortcuts to wealth through involvement in criminal activities.

The market leader called for a renewed national orientation to instil confidence, discipline, and productivity in the country’s youth.

He said, “Nigerians also need confidence in the country and a renewed work ethic. Too many young people expect wealth overnight. Life doesn’t work that way. I grew up farming with my grandparents, producing food for our community, even while schooling.

“Youth should be encouraged to get educated, embrace agriculture, and engage in meaningful work. That’s how nations are built. Unfortunately, when you walk the streets at night, you sometimes see young people wasting their potential, and it’s heartbreaking. The government must do more to reorient our youth and show them the rewards of hard work.”

Ikechukwu-Raphael maintained that while economic reforms would take time to fully yield results, collective responsibility, moderation in pricing and investment in Agriculture would help Nigerians weather the current hardship.

Calling on traders to guard against excessive profiteering and price increases of food items, he emphasised the need for coordinated efforts by well-meaning Nigerians to reduce the hardship faced by Nigerians.

He noted that insecurity and poor infrastructure remain the greatest threats to food production, adding that ongoing efforts by the National Security Adviser and the Ministry of Works are aimed at addressing these challenges.",https://guardian.ng/news/nigeria/metro/market-leader-decries-get-rich-quick-syndrome-among-youths/,https://guardian.ng
"Anambra 2025: Report flags Ihiala, Aguata LGAs as hotspots, warns of low trust in INEC","With less than two months to the November 2025 off-cycle governorship election in Anambra State, a new risk assessment report has identified Ihiala and Aguata local government areas as the most volatile hotspots.

The report also warned that public trust in the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) remains dangerously low.

The report, titled “The Early Warning: Assessing Pre-Election Security Risk Ahead of the 2025 Anambra Off-Cycle Governorship Election”, was conducted by the Kimpact Development Initiative (KDI) across all 21 LGAs of the state.

The document, presented by the executive director of KDI, Bukola Idowu, to stakeholders on Friday in Abuja, painted a picture of insecurity, political rivalry, and fragile institutional trust that could undermine the credibility of the poll.

According to the report, Ihiala and Aguata stand out as severe risk LGAs, where a combination of youth mobilisation, political thuggery, and historical disputes over candidate selection make the areas flashpoints for potential electoral violence.

Other LGAs categorised as high risk include Awka South, Ogbaru, Onitsha North, Anaocha, Idemili North, Idemili South, Nnewi North, Orumba North, Orumba South, Anambra East, and Dunukofia.

Onitsha South, Njikoka, Nnewi South, and Anambra West were classified as moderate-risk zones.

Idowu recalled that in Ihiala, insecurity was so severe during the 2021 governorship election that INEC was unable to conduct voting on election day, resorting instead to a supplementary poll.

In Aguata, the birthplace of Governor Charles Soludo, the report cited persistent vote-buying, deep political rivalries, and limited trust in security agencies as factors that heightened the risk of violence.

Beyond the hotspots, the survey reveals an alarming crisis of confidence in INEC, with nearly 71.5 per cent of respondents expressing either very little or no trust at all in the commission’s ability to conduct free and fair elections.

Only 15.28 per cent of Anambra citizens said they had a great deal of trust in INEC, while 13.19 per cent indicated some trust.

According to the document, majority linked their scepticism to the 2023 general elections, when glitches in the Result Viewing Portal (IReV), delays in result transmission, and operational failures raised doubts about electoral transparency.

The report warned that these trust deficits could fuel voter apathy and unrest, revealing that Anambra has already recorded a historic decline in turnout, falling to just 10.3 per cent in the 2021 governorship election, despite high political awareness .

“Perception matters as much as performance. In a competitive environment with active online narratives, even isolated failures can be generalised as systemic bias”, it said.

The document stressed that without urgent measures to rebuild credibility, operational challenges such as the late arrival of voting materials, malfunctioning BVAS machines, and opaque collation could trigger widespread suspicion, disinformation, and unrest.

Security agencies were also flagged as facing a trust crisis, with citizens citing unresolved abuses, heavy-handed tactics, and opaque auxiliary operations in areas such as Nnewi and Ogbaru as reasons for their lack of confidence.

INEC, according to the report, must prioritise operational basics: timely logistics, stress-tested BVAS deployment, credible result management, and transparent incident reporting.

It also recommended real-time updates on polling arrangements and the immediate publication of LGA-level results as trust-building steps, while advising security agencies to strengthen community engagement, adopt transparent incident protocols, and deploy adequately trained personnel in proportion to LGA risk ratings.",https://guardian.ng/news/nigeria/metro/anambra-2025-report-flags-ihiala-aguata-lgas-as-hotspots-warns-of-low-trust-in-inec/,https://guardian.ng
"Senator Buba partnering NSA to end insecurity, not sponsoring bandits — Coalition","A coalition of North East groups, including the Northeast Concerned Citizens Association, Shehu Buba Ambassadors, Association of Tailors and Artisans, and the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises in Bauchi State, has dismissed allegations linking the senator representing Bauchi South to banditry.

The groups, in a joint press conference on Friday, believed that the allegation was a “Pull Him Down” tactic by his political rivals. The Coordinator of the group, Mubarak Inuwa Gorama, speaking on behalf of the coalition, stated that certain “malicious and politically-inspired” allegations had been made to link Shehu Buba Umar with banditry.

He said, “These claims are not only false but a calculated attempt to discredit the integrity of a man whose record in public service stands as one of sacrifice, patriotism, and untiring commitment to national security.

“For the avoidance of doubt, distinguished Senator Shehu Buba Umar has consistently demonstrated leadership in the fight against insecurity. As Chairman of the Senate Committee on National Security and Intelligence, he has been at the forefront of pushing innovative strategies that go beyond the use of force.

“He has argued, both in the Senate and during public engagements, that Nigeria must adopt a blend of kinetic and non-kinetic approaches if the fight against banditry, insurgency, and other crimes is to yield lasting results. This is why he has championed dialogue, reconciliation, and socio-economic renewal as vital tools alongside military action,” he said.

Mubarak believed that the Senator’s non-kinetic advocacy is already shaping policy directions at the national level and is “worthy of note that under the leadership of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Nigeria has witnessed renewed vigour in the war against insecurity.

“The President’s firm support for reforms in the security sector, coupled with his approval of critical interventions, has provided the enabling environment for sustainable peace-building efforts across the country.”

He said that recently, the Nation witnessed how Senator Buba’s efforts, in collaboration with the Office of the National Security Adviser and other key stakeholders, have led to a more balanced approach to security management.

“In this regard, the role of Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, the National Security Adviser, must be commended. His pragmatic headship, openness to innovative ideas, and relentless commitment to national security have been instrumental in translating Senator Buba’s non-kinetic advocacy into actionable policy. Civil society networks across the country have acknowledged the positive impact of this strategy, noting a gradual reduction in violent incidents in communities once plagued by criminality.”",https://guardian.ng/news/senator-buba-partnering-nsa-to-end-insecurity-not-sponsoring-bandits-coalition/,https://guardian.ng
FG distributes farm inputs in Niger to boost food security,"The Governor of Niger State, Muhammad Umaru Bago, has performed the official flag-off of the federal government’s free distribution of agricultural inputs and equipment to smallholder farmers’ associations for year-round farming in the state.

An initiative by the federal government targeting 31 selected cooperatives in Niger, including women and people with special needs, was held at the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security Green House, Minna, on Friday, September 12, 2025.

Bago praised President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his ongoing support in advancing agriculture, stating that the all-year-round farming initiative of the federal government will significantly motivate farmers and enable them to be self-sufficient, thus supporting its food security and sovereignty goals.

The governor also praised the Minister of State for Agriculture and Food Security for choosing Niger State as a pilot state for the all-year-round farming initiative and other agricultural policies of the federal government.

He explained that the support from the federal government will strengthen what the Niger State government is already implementing in agriculture,

and it would solve 50 per cent of the farmers’ challenges.

In his keynote address, the Minister of State for Agriculture, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, stated that the free distribution of farm inputs to smallholder farmers is one of the many robust policies of President Tinubu’s administration aimed at supporting year-round farming in Nigeria to build resilient and sustainable agricultural systems that would ensure food sovereignty.

Sabi noted that the president’s food policies align with numerous economic reforms aimed at boosting productive capacity in the country, creating jobs, and lowering the cost of living, while also ensuring inclusivity. He also added that the ministry is implementing many agricultural programmes and projects designed to support year-round farming.

He appreciated the giant strides made by Governor Bago in agriculture, which he said have made Niger State a model and pilot state for the implementation of federal government agricultural initiatives.

Also speaking, the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, Dr. Marcus Ogunbiyi, disclosed that at least 35 per cent of the inputs are targeted at women farmers to ensure increased opportunities for women in line with the National Gender Policy on Agriculture.

Ogunbiyi hinted that the ministry is working closely with all sub-national governments, farmers’ cooperatives, and the private sector to ensure that only genuine farmers get the inputs and called on the beneficiaries to use them effectively.

In their separate goodwill messages, representatives of the Niger State Ministry of Agriculture, the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), the Nigeria Association of Women in Agriculture, and the people with special needs appreciated the present administration, both at the federal and state levels for their continued support towards encouraging the populace engage in agricultural activities, adding that the support has made them self-reliant.

Air Peace crew tests positive for alcohol after plane skids off runway – NSIB,"A preliminary report released by the Nigeria Safety Investigation Bureau (NSIB) on the serious incident involving an Air Peace flight from Lagos to Port Harcourt has revealed that the flight cabin crew tested positive for alcohol and cannabis consumption.

The report on the serious incident involving a Boeing 737-524 aircraft, with nationality and registration marks 5N-BQQ, operated by Air Peace Limited, occurred on 13 July 2025 at the Port Harcourt International Airport.

It stated that the aircraft, with about 103 persons on board, landed long on runway 21 after an unstabilised final approach and then touched down 2,264 metres from the runway threshold before coming to a final stop 209 metres into the clearway.

A statement signed by the Director, Public Affairs and Family Assistance, Mrs. Bimbo Oladeji, stated that all passengers and crew disembarked safely, and no injuries were reported.

It, however, stated that the initial toxicological tests conducted on the flight crew revealed positive results for certain substances, including indicators of alcohol consumption, with a cabin crew member testing positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component in cannabis.

The results, according to the statement, are being reviewed under the human performance and safety management components of the investigation.

The NSIB said it has issued immediate safety recommendations for Air Peace Limited to strengthen crew resource management (CRM) training, particularly in handling unstabilised approaches and go-around decisions, and to reinforce internal procedures for crew fitness-for-duty monitoring before flight dispatch.

It added that the final report will present detailed conclusions and additional recommendations to enhance aviation safety in Nigeria.",https://guardian.ng/business-services/aviation-business/air-peace-crew-tests-positive-for-alcohol-after-plane-skids-off-runway-nsib/,https://guardian.ng
"IATA, experts kick as FG insists on VAT payment by airlines","Federal Government has declared that there is no going back on the full implementation of the new Tax Reforms Act, which is slated to commence operations from January 1, 2026.

This is as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has faulted the Federal Government for contravening the numerous international treaties it signed with other countries and organisations, including the December 2024 Treaty of the Economic of West African Countries (ECOWAS), which prohibits member nations from paying taxes on air passengers and goods.

Participants yesterday at a Business Webinar jointly organised by the Aviation & Allied Business in collaboration with the Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS) with the theme: ‘Nigeria Tax Act (2025) & The Aviation Industry: Aviation Sector Enlightenment Initiative,’ described the new tax reforms as multiple taxation on the aviation sector, especially the airline operators.

The Assistant Director, Nigeria Revenue Service (formerly FIRS), Mrs Nkechi Umegakwe, in her presentation, said the government followed due diligence before coming up with the new tax laws.

Umegakwe, who was the lead presenter at the event, insisted that it was mandatory for airline operators, including other allied businesses in the aviation sector, to now pay the Value Added Tax (VAT) on all of their services and operations.

Currently, airlines are exempted from the payment of import duties and VAT on importation of commercial aircraft, commercial aircraft engines, spare parts and air tickets. She insisted that all the above are now liable to VAT from January 1, 2026.

According to her, the new tax reforms were geared towards increased revenue generation for the Federal Government, business cost reduction via VAT recovery, improved cash flow for businesses, and stronger compliance via digital invoicing and tracking, among others.

Umegakwe said that under the new tax reforms, various taxes had been harmonised to create a unified system in to eliminate inconsistencies and drive efficiency, while it also simplified the current tax laws.

But the Area Manager, West and Central Africa, IATA, Dr Samson Fatokun, in his contribution as a member of a panel, criticised the government for inconsistencies.

Fatokun, in his presentation, said the airlines and other operators in the sector were already overburdened with numerous levies and charges, wondering why the government was bent on adding to the current challenges in the sector.

Fatokun mentioned the payment of five per cent Ticket Sales Charge/Cargo Sales Charge (TSC/CSC) by the airlines as one of the levies the airlines were currently battling with. He maintained that the five per cent TSC/CSC inflated the price of air tickets and scared away some potential air passengers from the sector.

He recalled that President Bola Tinubu, in December 2024, as the Chairman of ECOWAS, signed a treaty with other member nations, which prohibited taxes on air passengers and cargo.

The new treaty will take effect from January 1, 2026. Also, an aviation expert, Capt. Samuel Caulcrick, said the various taxes and levies in the sector were already choking the operators and slowing down the growth of business in the sector.

He argued that payment of 7.5 per cent VAT and TSC/CSC by the airlines would amount to multiple taxation on the industry and called on the government to rescind its decision.

Caulcrick further posited that all the money being spent on the sector came from air passengers and shippers, noting that any additional tax would kill the industry.

Also, the Managing Director of Pathfinder Securities, Mrs Nkechi Onyenso, canvassed further engagements by the Federal Government and aviation business stakeholders.

According to her, the paucity of foreign exchange, multiple taxation, and other levies had negative impacts on the aviation industry generally.",https://guardian.ng/business-services/aviation-business/iata-experts-kick-as-fg-insists-on-vat-payment-by-airlines/,https://guardian.ng
"N712b inadequate for new Lagos Airport terminal, says Kyari","Sheri Kyari, is a proven aviation industry professional, having worked as an aircraft maintenance engineer for almost five decades. In this interview with OLUSEGUN KOIKI, he speaks on the planned demolition of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) Terminal One, Lagos, and the Federal Government’s Bilateral Air Service Agreement (BASA) arrangement with Brazil, among others.

The Federal Government, a few weeks ago, unveiled plans to demolish the existing MMIA1 for total reconstruction. What is your view on this?

If the Federal Government is thinking of expanding the MMIA1, I think it is a good idea. But if it is about bringing the entire terminal down and constructing another one, then we are going to cause a big chaos. I do not know how we are going to handle airplanes and passenger facilitation at the recently constructed Murtala Muhammed International Airport Terminal Two (MMIA2).

Looking at the size of that terminal, I do not know how it will cope with the traffic. But if it is about refurbishing it without bringing it down, there is no problem because it can be done systematically, maybe starting with the E-Wing, and then you move to the D-Wing. With that, it will still be available to a large extent for passenger use.

However, if it is a total collapse of that terminal to construct a new one, the government should do a lot of analysis in terms of how they are going to facilitate passenger movement and aeroplanes that will come there. That can lead to maybe what we call the slot system at the airport.

They have to plan that; they must create slots so that the little area that is available, airlines can plan with their slots. Bringing that terminal down is fearful. It is scary as far as I am concerned.

The government has also budgeted the sum of N712 billion for the reconstruction of the airport. Do you think the amount is adequate for the quantum of jobs to be done?

If the government is bringing the entire terminal down, even the cost of bringing it down will be in billions of naira. The amount of money budgeted for the project is too meagre when you consider the impact of inflation on project delivery. But if they are just going to reconstruct the terminal in such a way that it can increase efficiency, I think the budgeted money would be enough.

A few weeks ago, the Federal Government signed a Bilateral Air Service Agreement (BASA) arrangement with Brazil, while Air Peace has also indicated its readiness to commence direct flight services between the two countries before the end of the year. Do you think the route is commercially viable?

Well, route development takes time. Some routes were flown for more than one year before they peaked with passengers. Also, if the government has entered into a Bilateral Air Service Agreement (BASA) arrangement with Brazil, there must be trade agreements. Our businessmen can go there to buy things. And then we can send, perhaps, raw materials there; we can even send finished goods from Nigeria. It is when you look at the commercial activities of both countries that you can properly evaluate the viability. You can then think of stimulating the growth of traffic.

There will be some observations in terms of Brazil being a drug country. However, this will be left for our security agencies to handle. They will need to step up their game to apprehend anybody who attempts to bring in drugs here from the country.

Brazil is a huge country in terms of land mass. It is left for our commercial industry to look at what is being produced in Brazil. If you are talking about passenger load, like I said earlier, an airline can take more than one year to develop a route.

Also, if there are no other airlines in Africa flying to Brazil, it will still be to our advantage. If Air Peace is flying around African countries, the passengers can use Nigeria as a transit. Definitely, if it is consistent for the next year, I think we should be able to see some load factor. I am sure the traffic will grow over time.

Between a flag carrier and a national carrier, which should Nigeria adopt?

If you look at the African trend, countries, irrespective of their size, are creating carriers. We are not saying that the government should participate, but having a national carrier gives the industry a kind of protection internationally. Today, we know that British Airways is not owned by the British Government. The government franchises the name, while a group of people pick the name, and they are using it. So, a national carrier is important.

The government can identify with a national carrier. I don’t see anything wrong if the Federal Government today franchises the name and then probably takes a maximum of five per cent shares and allows individuals and institutions to invest in the airline.",https://guardian.ng/business-services/aviation-business/n712b-inadequate-for-new-lagos-airport-terminal-says-kyari/,https://guardian.ng
VivaJets partners AEW to boost aviation sector,"Nigeria’s business aviation company, VivaJets, has unveiled plans to scale up its services to key players in Africa’s oil and gas and energy sectors.

It is the official private aviation partner for the upcoming African Energy Week (AEW): ‘Invest in African Energies 2025’, which holds from September 29 through October 3 in Cape Town, South Africa.

Its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Erika Achum, in a statement, said it sought to underscore private aviation’s role in engendering continental economic prosperity.

Achum also said that VivaJets would be providing aircraft charter services directly to the event.The event, he said, is the continent’s premier gathering for energy stakeholders, bringing together governments, investors, and industry leaders to advance Africa’s energy agenda.

According to him, this is coming amidst a rapid expansion of the two-year-old company, with global routes and an enlarged fleet.

Achum expressed that VivaJets’ role as a private aviation partner reflected the company’s commitment to strengthening regional connectivity and supporting Africa’s economic development.

He added that the company was also positioning itself at the heart of an industry where mobility, efficiency, and access are needed for unlocking opportunities.

The statement hinted that Achum would participate in the 2025 event as a panelist and would be expected to highlight the pivotal role of Small, Medium and Enterprises (SMEs) and startups in driving inclusive economic growth across Africa.

His remarks, the statement added, would also focus on the aviation industry’s contribution to supporting trade and investment, particularly in sectors such as oil and gas, where reliable air transport remains indispensable.

He said: “Private aviation is more than luxury, it’s an enabler of progress. When investors and executives can move without hassle across borders, deals happen faster, opportunities are unlocked, and industries grow.

“At VivaJets, our mission is to make that possible, and African Energy Week offers the perfect stage to demonstrate how aviation can fuel Africa’s transformation.”

Also commenting, Tejumade Salami, the Chief Operating Officer (COO), Vivajets, said that energy is one of the most dynamic sectors shaping Africa’s future, while the aviation industry is the bridge that connects people, ideas, and investments within it.

He pointed out that as the official private aviation partner for AEW, the company was delighted to provide seamless and world-class aviation services to leaders and investors who work to unlock Africa’s vast energy potential.

VivaJets has been expanding rapidly to meet growing demand. Before the end of 2025, the company planned to induct three Bombardier Challenger 604 aircraft into its fleet, backed by $25 million in financing.

These additions would complement its existing Challenger 604, Gulfstream G550, and Hawker 900XP, enhancing its ability to serve both domestic and international clients.",https://guardian.ng/business-services/aviation-business/vivajets-partners-aew-to-boost-aviation-sector/,https://guardian.ng

Stakeholders seek reform to improve supply chain process,"Amid mounting challenges of regional trade integration, digital disruption and climate change, stakeholders have pushed for policies to strengthen the country’s supply chain.

The stakeholders who gathered at the maiden supply chain conference, organised by the African Centre for Supply Chain (ACSC), argued that Nigeria must prioritise execution of supply chain policies to achieve growth, warning that weak enforcement and persistent logistics challenges continued to undermine its competitiveness.

Group Director, Supply Chain, Flour Mills of Nigeria, Cephas Afebuameh, who spoke on ‘The Supply Chain of Now: Technology, Sustainability, and Social Impact’, said Nigeria, even though it has policies, is bedevilled by the challenges of poor execution.

“Policies are good, but what is also important is goals. How are we measuring attainment over those goals?” he asked.

Afebuameh linked Nigeria’s most significant supply chain gap to talent, urging that the government fix infrastructure gaps that align with policies for a profitable supply chain sector.

The Director-General of ACSC, Dr Obiora Madu, stated that weak infrastructure and policy bottlenecks have kept Nigeria uncompetitive in logistics.

“If roads are good, delivery will be fast. In logistics, time is money. If you were using four days to deliver and you’re able to cut it to three, you have saved so much money,” he said.

He called for better power infrastructure, streamlined port processes, and reduced checkpoints, noting that corruption and sabotage continue to undermine supply chain efficiency.

According to him, “Supply chain is no longer part of the business; supply chain is the business.”

Looking ahead, Madu said ACSC would intensify advocacy by engaging government and National Assembly members, adding that supply chain issues will also feature at the upcoming Nigeria Economic Summit Group’s yearly conference.

Addressing key issues in global trade, Treasurer and Chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce, Dr Omolara Akanji, warned that Nigeria’s supply chains are under pressure from tariff structures that increase costs and weaken competitiveness.",https://guardian.ng/business-services/stakeholders-seek-reform-to-improve-supply-chain-process/,https://guardian.ng
Flood displaces 270 households in Zaria,"There was chaos in Zaria as a devastating flash flood caused by heavy rainfall wreaked havoc on several communities within the Local Government Area, displacing hundreds of families and destroying property worth millions of naira.

According to an assessment by the Nigerian Red Cross Society, approximately 270 households, including 476 children, have been displaced and are in urgent need of assistance.

The floodwaters affected at least 115 houses, rendering many families homeless and stranded.

The flood disaster caused by an early morning downpour that began on Thursday affected the communities of Gangaren Mobil, Bayan Cinema in Tudun Wada Ward, as well as Magume, Bako Zuntu, and Kamacha in Tukur Tukur Ward. The rapid rise of water destroyed valuable belongings, including clothing, electronics, gadgets, and essential food supplies.

A coordinated assessment team, led by Jamil Ahmad Mohammad Jaga of the Nigerian Red Cross Society, promptly visited the affected areas. The team, which included officials from the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), the Director of Emergency and Security Services, and the Deputy Director of Welfare, later travelled to Kofar Kuyanbana to assess the full extent of the damage caused by the heavy rainfall.

Despite widespread property destruction, authorities have confirmed that no lives were lost, a fact attributed to divine mercy.

"Police bust car theft syndicate, recover stolen vehicle in Akure","Operatives of the Ondo State Police Command have busted a car theft syndicate that specialised in stealing vehicles directly from the compounds of owners within the Akure metropolis.

The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Olayinka Ayanlade, revealed that the command recovered a stolen Toyota ‘Muscle’ Camry and also arrested one suspect who allegedly bought the stolen vehicle.

According to Ayanlade, a report was filed on July 18, 2025, following a complaint made by one Bolanle Akomolafe, who reported that some unknown persons had unlawfully entered her apartment at the Osi axis of the Akure North Local Council Area of the state.

The police image maker maintained that the suspects stole the key to her golden-coloured 2010 Toyota Camry and made away with the unregistered vehicle, along with other valuable items.

He said, “Following diligent investigation and intelligence-led policing, operatives of the Command Surveillance Team, acting on credible information, successfully recovered the vehicle on the 7th of September, 2025, in Owo, where it had been repainted from its original golden colour to blue and concealed in the apartment of one Fagbote Micheal Olamilekan ‘m’.

“Upon interrogation, the suspect confessed that he bought the vehicle from one Adewumi (surname unknown), now at large, at the rate of ₦4 million, despite the vehicle having been previously purchased by the rightful owner on 26th December, 2024, at the rate of ₦10 million.

“Further investigations revealed that the suspect conspired with a painter who has been positively identified but is currently at large and who aided in changing the vehicle’s colour in an attempt to conceal its true identity. Both the painter and the seller of the stolen vehicle are actively being pursued by the police and will be brought to justice.

“The Command seizes this opportunity to strongly caution all automotive artisans, including painters, panel beaters, rewire technicians, and mechanics, to exercise due diligence and verify ownership documents before undertaking repainting, reconfiguration, or major works on vehicles.

“Any artisan who collaborates, knowingly or otherwise, in tampering with stolen vehicles will be treated as an accomplice and will face the full weight of the law. Efforts are ongoing to track down the fleeing accomplices and dismantle the entire criminal network behind the theft.”",https://guardian.ng/news/nigeria/metro/police-bust-car-theft-syndicate-recover-stolen-vehicle-in-akure/,https://guardian.ng
"I won’t leave abandoned projects in Kaduna, says Uba Sani","Kaduna State Governor Uba Sani has pledged to complete all projects within the tenure of his administration, stating that his government will not abandon any project.

Sani announced this during the groundbreaking ceremony for the township roads at Rigasa ward in Igabi local government of Kaduna State on Friday.

Speaking extempore in Hausa, the governor stated that the road project would be carried out without incurring any debt, adding that his administration will not owe any contractor once his project is completed.

Governor Sani further remarked that the four road projects in Rigasa have been awarded to China Civil Engineering Corporation (CCEC), a company he described as versatile and credible.

According to him, the project will be completed within one year, as he has already paid 50 per cent of the mobilisation fees to CCEC.

The governor pledged to transform Rigasa into a modern township with quality infrastructure and social amenities.

He described the ceremony as “not just about breaking ground; it is about rewarding hard work. It is about opening up opportunities for the hardworking people of Igabi Local Government.”

“Rigasa is one of the largest and most populous wards in Nigeria. It is populated by the urban poor. It has suffered neglect for so long. Its infrastructure deficit is worrisome,” he said.

Governor Sani noted that despite its proximity to the city centre and being home to hardworking and resourceful citizens, Rigasa had been overlooked for too long.

He recalled the significant support he received from Rigasa during the 2023 governorship election, noting that 32.06 per cent of the total votes from Igabi LGA came from the ward, and added, “For this, I remain eternally grateful to you.”

Governor Sani emphasised that the project would directly benefit thousands of households in the area.

“In Igabi Local Government lies a large chunk of people who support us through their daily sacrifices as farmers, civil servants, businessmen and women”, he stressed.

“Through their sacrifices, they contribute significantly to our economy as well as our GDP. Investing, therefore, in roads like these will directly improve the livelihoods of thousands of households,” Sani added.

Similarly, the governor performed another groundbreaking for the road reconstruction of Zango at Tudun Wada ward in Kaduna South LGA.

He said, “I have an emotional attachment to this area because I am a product of Kaduna Polytechnic.”

“I understand and share in the pains of the inhabitants of this area who have suffered neglect for decades. There is very little road infrastructure in this area”, he said.

“The few existing ones are dilapidated. This area is populated by the urban poor who are making huge contributions to the development of our dear state,” he added.

Governor Sani vowed to turn the pains of the residents of Tudun Wada into joy, adding that “today is the beginning of good things for Zango and other parts of Tudun Wada.”

“This road is hugely significant because it passes through several key establishments like Zango Cattle Market, Animal Feed Stores, Sheikh Abubakar Gumi College, Islamic Medical Foundation, and School of Health Technology, as well as its proximity to the Kaduna City Centre and link to the Nnamdi Azikiwe Western By-Pass,” he noted.

The governor noted that his administration has made significant progress in road construction and rehabilitation since taking office.

“Under our Rural Revitalisation Agenda, we flagged off the construction of 85 roads covering 785km in the first phase, with 44 already completed and the rest nearing completion. Under the second phase, we are delivering over 50 more roads and bridges totalling 550km,” he added.",https://guardian.ng/news/nigeria/metro/i-wont-leave-abandoned-projects-in-kaduna-says-uba-sani/,https://guardian.ng
Police arrest seven suspected attackers of Bauchi Polytechnic,"The Bauchi State Police Command announced that it has apprehended seven suspects in connection with the robbery attack on students’ hostel at the Federal Polytechnic, Bauchi, on 12 August.

The midnight raid caused emotional distress among the students, resulting in severe injuries, property loss, and disruption of their academic calendar. It also led to violent demonstrations by students demanding better security for their lives and property, which the police suppressed with teargas.

A month after the attack, a statement from the Police Spokesman, Ahmed Wakil, on Friday, confirmed that seven suspects had been arrested and confessed to committing the crime.

The suspect, according to him, indicated that they have been responsible for terrorising different parts of Yelwa, Birshi Gandu, Birshin Fulani, and Gwallameji, armed with dangerous weapons and flashlights.

“They have unlawfully entered various residences, where they seized valuables, inflicted injuries upon anyone who resisted, and occasionally fled to adjacent states to evade arrest,” he said in the statement.

Police said that the “these unscrupulous youth are from various areas within Bauchi metropolis, including Lushi, Birshin Fulani, and Birshi Gandu.

“The suspects include: Mansur Yakubu, aged 20 years, also known as Chasu, residing in Lushi; Abbas Auwal, aged 20 years, also known as Abe; Musa

Bala, aged 20 years, also called Baban Nani, a resident of Lushi; and Aliyu Ahmadu, aged 21 years, also known as Yellow, of Lushi.

“Others zurkarlaini Aliyu, aged 20 years, also known as Baki of Birshin Fulani; Muftahu Ibrahim, aged 20 years, also known as Dodo of Lushi; Hamza Bala, aged 29 years, also known as R-Kelly of Lushi.

“The suspects have confessed to their involvement in the crime and have implicated 13 additional accomplices, including one Adamu Muhammad, popularly known as Daddy, a resident of Birshin Fulani. Adamu Muhammad was apprehended by the detectives attached to Yelwa Divisional Police Headquarters on 1st September, 2025.”

He said that Adamu Muhammad Lawan (Daddy) admitted to participating in an armed robbery at the Federal Polytechnic, Bauchi. He stated that the operation was a coordinated effort involving approximately 20 participants from Birshin Fulani, Birshi Gandu, Lushi, and the larger Bauchi metropolitan area.

He said that as the mastermind, Adamu Muhammad orchestrated plans to invade the student accommodations at the Federal Polytechnic Bauchi. “They rob the students of their valuables, such as mobile phones, laptops, and power banks. It was revealed that the mastermind benefited from the proceeds of crime, three mobile phones (Oppo, Samsung, and Infinix), which he sold for 40,000 Naira through an associate, Salmanu AKA Papus.”",https://guardian.ng/news/nigeria/metro/police-arrest-seven-suspected-attackers-of-bauchi-polytechnic/,https://guardian.ng
To flush cybercrime law of ambiguity and enforcement impunity,"The Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, etc.) Act needs to be revisited to rectify provisions that cause controversy in the implementation of the law. It was enacted in 2015 with the intention of using the piece of legislation as a veritable tool to “protect critical national information infrastructure, and protection of computer systems and networks, electronic communications, data and computer programmes, intellectual property and privacy rights.”



The Act was designed to provide an effective, unified, and comprehensive legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for the prohibition, prevention, detection, prosecution, and punishment of cybercrimes in Nigeria. However, it is observed that law enforcers, leveraging the inelegant drafting style, have weaponised certain provisions of the cybersecurity law to clamp down on free speech.



In 2024, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) warned that the Act, and the amendments made to it, “have potential for abuse, particularly with respect to arrests and prosecutions of activists, journalists, bloggers, and ordinary social media users.” This fear was subsequently echoed by the heads of missions of the United States (U.S.), the United Kingdom (UK), Canada, Finland, and Norway.

Expressing concerns over the misuse of the cybercrimes law by security operatives, the diplomats lamented that the broad language of the law has left room for confusion and potential abuse, especially its vague definitions of ‘false information’, ‘cyberstalking’, ‘harassment’, and ‘insult’.

They submitted that the misuse of the law “undermines democratic advancement and civic participation, and also jeopardises investor confidence and risks deterring the innovation needed for economic growth.”



According to the envoys, healthy democracies are formed of many important ingredients, such as diverse perspectives and viewpoints. Therefore, the distortion of the original intent of the anti-cybercrime law “can lead to citizens becoming hesitant to speak out, weakening democratic accountability and potentially fuelling distrust in government.”



The kernel of the argument is mainly premised on the contentious provisions of Section 24 of the Act. This section is perceived as a deliberate attempt by the State to control online information, stifle free speech, repress dissenting views, and arbitrarily penalise critics. Many tagged it ‘a systemic criminalisation of the right to freedom of expression.’



Prior to its recent amendment, Section 24 of the Cybercrimes Act criminalised cyberstalking, and the transmission of messages, via a computer system or network, that are either “grossly offensive, pornographic or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character”, or are false for the purpose of “causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another.”



Ensuing developments reveal that relevant government authorities have grossly exploited and abused this portion of the law due to its broad scope, vagueness, and ambiguity. The Act failed to distinctly define or prescribe the elements of the offence of cyberstalking. Similarly, it did not stipulate the parameters for determining actions that can cause anxiety, or are of ‘menacing character’; thereby leaving the interpretation of these terms open-ended.



The constitutionality or otherwise of the instant provision was tested in the Nigerian courts, up to the apex level; however, no concrete results emanated from the process. The trial and appeal courts struck out the suit, while the Supreme Court never assigned a hearing date to the matter.



Fortuitously, the Economic Community of West African States Court of Justice provided the requisite succour in 2020. Delivering a landmark judgment, the regional court boldly declared that Section 24(1) of the Cybercrimes Act violates the right of freedom of expression and information. Consequently, it ordered that the controversial sub-section be repealed or amended.



Complying with this order, the Nigerian Government vide Section 5 of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, etc.) (Amendment) Act, 2024, significantly varied the provisions of Section 24(1). The amended law purports to cure the mischief in the old law by solely criminalising the electronic dissemination of messages that are either pornographic or false with the intent of causing a breakdown of law and order, posing a threat to life, or causing such a message to be sent.



Although the legislative intervention is well-intended, the new law is still partly tainted by ambiguity and uncertainty. For instance, the interpretation of the phrase “for the purpose of causing a breakdown of law and order” is problematic. The amendment does not furnish the ingredients of publications that can cause a breakdown of law and order.



Again, this lacuna is being leveraged by state actors to target activists, journalists, civil rights advocates, and other citizens for ventilating their perspectives on issues of national or public concern. The recent legal battle (albeit now amicably resolved) between Dele Farotimi and Afe Babalola, SAN, aptly illustrates this point.



The cybercrime charges (which were subsequently dropped) filed against Farotimi, following the complaint of alleged criminal defamation lodged by Babalola, included knowingly and intentionally transmitting false information for the purpose of causing breakdown of law and order contrary to and punishable under Section 24(1) (b) of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, etc) Act 2015 as amended.



Farotimi claimed he was mistreated, denigrated, and dehumanised by the Police even though he was merely accused of committing a misdemeanour with a maximum jail term of three (3) years. Ngozi Okoli was alleged to have been similarly ill-treated by the Police over her critical review of Erisco Foods’ tomato paste.

More worrisome is that some law enforcers seem oblivious to the alterations made to Section 24(1). Very recently, the Police charged two men, Saheed Jamiu Osama and Uyime Godwin Udoekwere, for allegedly making libelous statements and menacing the character of Mrs. Omowunmi Cynthia Aloba despite the repeal of the offence of ‘‘menacing character”.



Admittedly, cybercrime is a serious offence that could undermine political stability and economic development if not proactively and frontally curtailed. Nonetheless, the extant cybersecurity instrument is porous and nebulous. It is unpardonable for a criminal statute not to contain proper definitions, interpretations, or descriptions of fundamental terms. In addition, it is an aberration for such pieces of legislation to be devoid of the ingredients or elements constituting all prescribed offences.



“A law should not be vague or ambiguous, to ensure clarity, fairness, and to uphold the rule of law. Vague or ambiguous language can lead to uncertainty, misinterpretation, and inconsistent application by individuals and the courts, potentially resulting in injustice and a lack of public trust in the legal system. Clarity in statutes allows citizens to understand their rights and obligations, enabling them to conduct themselves accordingly and avoid violating the law.”

Undoubtedly, the Cybercrimes Act should be further revised to bring it into conformity with clarity, certainty, logic, equity, and justice. Insofar as it partially forayed into the realm of the fundamental right of freedom of expression, the constitutionality of some of its provisions will remain in issue. In the same vein, the raging controversy over the impunity exhibited by law enforcement agents in the course of (purportedly) giving effect to the Act will not abate.



Further, the circulation of misleading or false information against persons should not be criminalised unless it threatens the territorial integrity of the country. The civil law of tort sufficiently covers the field of defamation.



Considering the enormous resources and time expended in making constitutional amendments, it would be expected that the Nigerian judiciary would rise to the occasion in deserving cases. Bottom line, the Cybercrime Act should be clinically reviewed and refocused to reflect its original intentions.",https://guardian.ng/opinion/to-flush-cybercrime-law-of-ambiguity-and-enforcement-impunity/,https://guardian.ng
"KWAM-1, Emmanson cases mirror the impunity of Nigerian State","The recent twin incidents of unruly passengers and their awful handling by the Nigerian State culminate in a bad advertisement for an already battered image of the country. Clear cases of unruly conduct are statutorily criminal and should have been addressed by the relevant agencies in accordance with the law.

However, to placate indecency with official meddling and selective justice in the name of a “political solution” is tantamount to giving ammunition to bad behaviour and reaffirming a country that is a byword for double standards and complicit leadership.

The unruly cases of the Fuji maestro, Wasiu Ayinde (KWAM-1), and Miss Comfort Emmanson, exposed the rotten underbelly of the Nigerian State. KWAM-1 attempted to board a ValueJet flight in Abuja with a prohibited flask containing liquid, allegedly alcoholic. He allegedly emptied the contents on the crew and security personnel, then obstructed the aircraft in a suicidal act.

Barely five days later, another uncouth citizen, Emmanson, was in a bizarre and grossly demeaning evacuation exercise to be forcefully removed from an Ibom Air flight over a phone row that escalated into a physical confrontation with poorly trained and mean aviation staffers.

KWAM-1 walked home a free man. Emmanson was remanded at Tango City, later Kirikiri Correctional Centre, and slammed a lifetime ban by the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) – until public and civil pressure came good for her and won her a rapid freedom.



The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) clarified that in Emmanson’s case, Ibom Air chose to prosecute because the crew were physically assaulted. In KWAM-1’s case, ValueJet did not pursue legal action; instead, the NCAA petitioned authorities. But before the probe could start and charges filed, the Federal Government accepted KWAM 1’s forced apology in exchange for a one-month flight ban, announced plans to appoint him as an ambassador for airport security protocol. To cover up the blue murder, Emmanson also got a reprieve and withdrawal of charges, among others!



The foregoing is a clear case of selective justice that is just as bad as the unruly passengers deciding their own fates. They are foul calls in the aviation sector and the Nigerian justice system. For starters, unruly passengers like KWAM-1 and Emmanson are a global phenomenon that are often heavily penalised in other countries. Air travel is governed by a complex web of strict protocols designed to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone involved—from passengers and crew to ground staff.

A slight act of bad behaviour or non-compliance onboard or on ground leads to distractions, delays, flight diversions, and even more serious safety risks and attendant operational nightmares threatening the safety of both passengers and crew, mounting additional pressure on aviation security teams, and resulting in losses to the airlines that are notoriously high in risks and thin in profit margin.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recorded 53,538 cases of unruly passenger incidents from over 60 operators globally in 2024. Punishments for unruly passengers are inconsistent but increasingly serious. It includes relying on the Montreal Protocol 2014 (MP14) to allow the destination country to prosecute offences from the aircraft’s landing. Depending on the incident’s severity and the country’s laws, punishments can range from airline bans and large fines up to $37,000 to imprisonment and a felony conviction.



Part 17.89.1 of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority Regulations 2023 states that an unruly passenger at the airport terminal or on board an aircraft commits an offence. This include far-reaching acts such as: “(a) smoking on board an aircraft or in a non-smoking area of the terminal building; (b) use of mobile phones and/or other communication/electronics gadgets on board an aircraft without the approval of the aircraft commander;“ (c) fighting or other disorderly conduct on board an aircraft or at the terminal building; (d) any conduct/act constituting a nuisance to other passengers; (e) disobedience of lawful instructions issued by the aircraft commander, flight crew, cabin attendants, check-in staff and/or security screening staff; (f) any conduct that endangers or is likely to endanger the safety of flight operations; (g) tampering with smoke detectors and other aircraft equipment,” and it is in this sense that KWAM-1 and Emmanson come to a sharp focus and should have been handled differently.

Typical of an insidious norm of the Nigerian State, the Federal Government took the ignoble route of bungling the opportunity to show that the law is neither a respecter of persons nor entertains a sacred cow. Today’s Nigeria already has a bad reputation for being a home to lawless elites who can only thrive in Nigeria. The closer they are to the party in power, the greater their impunity to get away with malfeasance and ignoble acts. The sentiment out there is that KWAM-1 belongs to this category. Why prove them right by disbanding the cases even before trials? On whose instruction was the decriminalisation and withdrawal of the two cases?

Human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), rightly accused the Federal Government of undermining its moral authority and losing the moral right to arrest and prosecute any passenger who commits an offence at any of the nation’s airports. Pardoning KWAM-1 without a trial contradicts the principle of equal application of the law and erodes public confidence in the justice system. If a government can whitewash its own case, where is the rule of law? Why should any foreign investor want to partner with Nigeria or Nigerians or local operators, when a presidential impulse can dismiss all scores in favour of his cronies?

Curiously, the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Festus Keyamo, is a senior lawyer who should smell a reckless abuse of the law from a distance. In this case, he led the perfidy, again, usurping the autonomous role of the Civil Aviation Authority. With no guardrails, he characteristically jumped into the matter, became a sitting judge on the X platform, dishing out selective pardons and counter-orders – all in breaches of the aviation rules.

A lawyer, Keyamo, lacks an aviation background or competent training in technical and regulatory air transport matters, and he has betrayed his lack of suitability for his political office. The sector is highly professionalised with no room for showmanship or overzealous meddlesomeness of a political officeholder. In modern aviation, it is not the remit of a minister, the ministry, or a House Committee to investigate a core aviation incident or accident.



There are laws, and the NCAA should be allowed to implement extant regulations without interference. If the NCAA’s provisions are inadequate, as they sometimes would be, they are eligible for a review. And if the agency head is perceived as incompetent to supervise cases to their logical conclusion, there is a protocol for his replacement. But a meddlesome interloping minister who jumps into every incident is neither civil nor helpful to a sustainable Nigerian cause.

The autonomy of the NCAA is a standard International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) requirement, to which Nigeria is a signatory. The country is already walking on a tight rope ahead of another ICAO audit, bearing in mind her poor performance at the last audit. An NCAA that is tossed hither and thither by the whims of politicians and their uncultured cronies is a red flag before an auditor.



Unruly conduct in public is one of those structural rather than episodic malfeasances of the Nigerian State. These latest cases call for the handlers of the State to take a second look at the type of country they lead, and the legal cum moral barometer they are setting for the citizens and the young ones.",https://guardian.ng/opinion/editorial/kwam-1-emmanson-cases-mirror-the-impunity-of-nigerian-state/,https://guardian.ng
Alaafin Vs Ooni: Supremacy tussle not in Yoruba’s best interest,"What is brewing as a revival of the age-old supremacy battle between the Alaafin of Oyo and the Ooni of Ife is unnecessary and capable of harming the unity and cohesion required by the Yoruba people to tackle the challenges confronting the South West region and undermining its development aspirations.



Except for a few unpatriotic and selfish individuals who may hope to gain something from the antagonism between the two most prominent and leading Yoruba traditional rulers, the Yoruba people, both at home and abroad, will not welcome the unsavoury development that is purely about where the final authority in the Yoruba nation lies. This should not, either now or in the future, be a priority of any monarch again, particularly in a period when the pre-colonial traditional governance structure that required it for concrete assignment of power and responsibilities to avoid crisis no longer exists.

Rather than fight over jurisdiction, what really should be engaging the mind of the two rulers is the role each of them can and should be playing for the overall development of the Yoruba nation. This altercation should end now in the interest of peace and progress of the region.

Recent media reports indicated revival of the rivalry by the new entrants to the two thrones, Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Akeem Owoade and Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi. The controversy is about seniority and who has the right of conferment on any subject a traditional title, the influence of which covers the entire Yoruba land.

What really sparked the current fire was the plan by the Ooni Ogunwusi to confer the title of ‘Okanlomo of Yorubaland’ on Chief Dotun Sanusi who runs the Ilaji Resort and Sports Centre in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. But Alaafin Owoade felt slighted by the Ooni’s move, which he considered an affront and a trespass to his area of jurisdiction. Consequently, he reportedly ‘ordered’ Ooni Ogunwusi to rescind within 48 hours any plan to honour any Yoruba citizen within his (Oyo) empire.



Observers believe that by the ultimatum, Oba Owoade claimed to be senior to Ooni, in opposition to a similar claim by the late Ooni of Ife, Oba Okunade Sijuwade, that Ooni is senior to Alaafin. It was in 1991 that Oba Sijuwade and the then Alaafin, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, locked horns over the same seniority issue when Oba Sijuwade planned to confer the title of ‘Akinrogun of Yorubaland’ on Chief Tom Ikimi. Alaafin Adeyemi urged Ikimi not to accept the title, ostensibly claiming that he was the one with the authority to confer such a title on anyone.

The altercation culminated in Oba Sijuade declaring to the Oyo State government that the crown on the Alaafin of Oyo’s head, which confers on him the rights and responsibilities of a traditional ruler, was given to him by the Ooni of Ife, and that it could be withdrawn by the Ooni by evoking the special power conferred on him at the Temple of Oduduwa.



Such disagreement should not be allowed to fester because the Yoruba people do not need it. Already, some influential individuals and groups have started to take sides, flaunting different stories of what they believe to be the reality as regards who is the senior between the two monarchs and where the final authority of the Yoruba nation should lie.



The Alaafin and the Ooni should stop the crisis from escalating or constituting a threat to peace and growth of Yorubaland, a development that can cause loss of reverence to the two thrones. Any attempt to set the Yoruba history straight now is difficult and capable of unduly polarising the region.



Behind this altercation between the two rulers is mere egocentrism that offers no good for the Yoruba nation in today’s modern world, with new institutions still evolving. The empires and kingdoms of yesteryears had been replaced with regions, and now fragmented into smaller political entities known as states and local governments. The maps have been disrupted to the extent that many Yoruba people now find themselves scattered in some states and local governments outside what is known today as the South West, which is what is left of, at first, the balkanised Oyo Empire and later the fragmented Western region.

Consequently and obviously, the governance structure in the primordial and pre-colonial times that made the sphere of authority of a monarch sacrosanct has long been destroyed. The earlier the country’s traditional leaders come to terms with this reality the better for them and their people. Nothing should be allowed to reduce monarchies to objects of ridicule.

The Yoruba people are currently battling, on all fronts, endemic problems of lack of unity and peace, hostile working environment, dwindling agricultural output, kidnapping, cultism and other common criminalities to which they urgently need lasting solutions, not a supremacy battle. The region that was once a prominent mass producer of food and other agricultural products for local and foreign consumption is now taking the back seat, partly because of the unprecedented insecurity in the farms and even in the homes.

The forests are now replete with terrorists, kidnappers and other criminal elements that kidnap people, including traditional rulers, for ransom, rape old women and young girls and kill innocent citizens freely, making it difficult for farmers to go out and cultivate the land. The foundation of agriculture, with which the South West recorded monumental achievements in the past, is fast being destroyed.



Yoruba people expect Ooni and Alaafin to play a crucial role in tackling the insecurity in the land by deploying the bravery and gallantry with which Yoruba fought and won many battles under the leadership of the past Alaafins and Oonis to make the South West a safe place to live in. That is how the zone can make progress. The leaders should use what they have to develop the land.



It is encouraging that Ooni Ogunwusi and Alaafin Owoade, as chairman and co-chairman of the World Orisha Congress (WOOCON), are working together with other eminent Yoruba citizens, including the Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka and Prof. Wande Abimbola, and the National Institute for Cultural Orientation (NICO) to promote Yoruba cultural heritage in Brazil and other foreign countries. That is the way to go.

The Yoruba expect to see more of such joint efforts of the two monarchs, and in other areas, that will immensely benefit the South West and Nigeria. They are expected to make a practical contribution to the implementation of the contents of the Development Agenda for Western Nigeria (DAWN). This can only happen in an atmosphere of peace and mutual respect that must never be lost between the two great Yoruba leaders.

10 Years of Intense: What it takes to build a successful business from the ground up,"

Businesses are often born in one of two ways. Some begin with abundant capital, a network of investors, and the cushion of existing infrastructure. Others start with little more than conviction, discipline, and the determination to push through uncertainty. The company that is now Intense Group belongs firmly to the latter. It is a path that is less glamorous and more arduous, but one that demands intensity, the kind that transforms setbacks into lessons and limited resources into opportunities for reinvention.

The Intense story is inseparable from that of its founder, Leye Makanjuola, who believed that marketing could go beyond creativity and storytelling to deliver measurable and predictable growth powered by data and technology. The early years tested this conviction. Competing against better-funded firms meant Intense had to rely on clarity of purpose, sharper execution, and an uncompromising commitment to standards.

Every campaign had to justify its existence, every solution had to deliver tangible returns, and every client relationship had to be earned. This mindset created an organisation wired for resilience. Shortcuts were rejected, failures were examined rather than excused, and outcomes were prioritised above appearances.

Over time, that discipline began to pay off. Intense established itself as a trusted partner for businesses seeking more than vanity metrics. By combining data, technology, and AI-driven systems, the firm proved that marketing could be tracked, scaled, and sustained with precision. From its base in Lagos, the company expanded its influence, working with multinationals across industries. A decade on, Intense has evolved into a marketing technology group that now includes Intense Digital, Intense UK, Purple Stardust and Palet.

The journey has brought recognition. Industry accolades, including wins at the Pitcher Awards, highlight the company’s impact. Yet for Makanjuola, true validation lies in client results: stronger brands, bigger market share, and demonstrable return on investment. The firm’s 10th anniversary theme, A Decade of Unlocking Exceptional Growth for Business, reflects this philosophy. For Intense, the milestone is not a finish line but a checkpoint, a reminder that each stage of growth demands renewed intensity.

At the core of the company’s culture is that very principle. Expressed through the acronym TIGER O, which stands for Team Spirit, Innovation, Growth Orientation, Excellence, Responsibility, and Owner’s Mindset, these values are more than words on paper. They are daily practices. Collaboration drives urgency, innovation prevents stagnation, and accountability ensures that every challenge becomes an opportunity.

The lesson in the Intense story is clear. Building a successful business from scratch is not determined by the size of initial funding but by the intensity of execution. In environments marked by currency volatility, global competition, and constant disruption, what sustains vision and turns plans into performance is not luck or strategy alone but discipline and resilience.

From a Nigerian startup built on conviction to an international group with offices across two continents, Intense shows that building from the ground up is not only possible. Done with intensity, it can become the very advantage that drives lasting growth.

AI in Africa to top $16.5B by 2030: Mastercard explores path for continued digital transformation,"Please see caption below: Mark Elliott, Division President, Africa at Mastercard (L) and Ambassador Philip Thigo, Special Envoy on Technology in Kenya (R), at the official launch of the Mastercard whitepaper which provides insights on harnessing the power of AI in driving digital transformation

Key insights from Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria and Morocco demonstrate AI’s potential to drive financial inclusion, job creation and innovation.

Up to 230 million digital jobs projected in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 – but infrastructure, regulation and local talent remain critical gaps.

Mastercard has today released its latest whitepaper, Harnessing the transformative power of AI in Africa, a pan-African study of the continent’s readiness, opportunity and roadmap for responsible artificial intelligence (AI) adoption. The whitepaper provides detailed insights into how AI—if deployed responsibly and inclusively—can unlock transformative outcomes across the continent’s major industries, including agriculture, healthcare, education, energy and finance.

With Africa’s AI market projected to grow from USD 4.5 billion in 2025 to USD 16.5 billion by 2030 according to a recent report from Statista, the paper presents a clear case for multi-stakeholder collaboration and investment. It highlights how Africa’s unique demographics, mobile-first infrastructure and entrepreneurial spirit position it as an active architect of the future.

Mark Elliott, division president, Africa at Mastercard, commented: “Africa’s engagement with AI is already reshaping lives — not just in labs, but in farms, clinics and classrooms. To unlock its full potential, we need investment in infrastructure, data, talent, and policy. At Mastercard, we believe responsible, locally rooted AI can drive inclusive growth and connect more people to opportunity.”

The whitepaper outlines the potential positive impact of AI on digital infrastructure, policy and governance, research and development, local language processing and investment into Africa. It also explores how AI can accelerate job creation, with up to 230 million digital jobs projected by 2030, and increase access to formal finance through AI-enabled credit scoring and fraud prevention.

Greg Ulrich, chief AI and data officer, Mastercard, said: “AI is only as powerful as the trust behind it. At Mastercard, we’re committed to building AI that’s responsible, inclusive, and built to bring value to our customers, partners and employees. This isn’t just innovation—it’s innovation with integrity.”

Regional highlights covered in the whitepaper include:

South Africa: South Africa attracted USD 610 million in AI-focused venture capital in 2023, with total AI investment expected to reach USD 3.7 billion by 2030. With the highest data and infrastructure readiness in Africa, the country is solidifying its role as a continental leader in AI research and application. It is home to the Artificial Intelligence Institute of South Africa which serves as a gateway for students and professionals to access world-class education, research and industry news. National plans aim to develop up to 300 AI start-ups and train 5,000 AI professionals by 2030, creating the foundation for a vibrant, homegrown AI ecosystem.

Kenya: An emerging leader in AI innovation, Kenya has leveraged its “Silicon Savannah” status to securely deploy AI across sectors. Platforms like Tala use mobile data for credit scoring, while Jacaranda Health’s UlizaLlama, an AI-powered chatbot, provides maternal health support in five local languages. The newly launched National AI Strategy (2025–2030) outlines the government’s commitment to positioning Kenya as a regional leader in AI research and development, innovation and commercialization for socioeconomic development.

Nigeria: Nigeria ranks second in the number of AI startups in Africa and secured USD 218 million in VC investment in 2023. As one of Africa’s most dynamic AI ecosystems, Nigeria is using AI to personalize learning (Rising Academies), deliver microfinance via Kudi.ai, and strengthen governance with AI tools that monitor public fund allocation. With a $1.4 billion projected AI market size by 2025, the government’s proactive approach, combined with growing private-sector innovation, suggests promising growth in AI applications.

Morocco: An emerging AI hub in North Africa, Morocco is advancing AI adoption across healthcare, energy, agriculture, and finance. Institutions such as Mohammed VI Polytechnic University and DeepEcho are driving local innovation, while the MoroccoAI Annual Conference is shaping national dialogue on the future of AI. Under its Digital 2030 strategy, Morocco aims to attract USD 1.1 billion in investment and create 240,000 digital jobs by 2030. Despite this progress, the whitepaper warns that data fragmentation, language exclusion and regulatory inconsistency could deepen the digital divide.

Harnessing the potential of AI in Africa will be instrumental in accelerating financial inclusion and driving the continent’s digital and economic growth. Strategic collaborations between governments, fintechs, and global partners will be key to unlocking AI’s full impact.

Mastercard’s whitepaper draws on insights from leading African technologists, policymakers, academics and entrepreneurs, including interviews with UNESCO, the African Center for Economic Transformation, and fintech leaders across the region.

PDP leaders in Ife reconcile with Osun deputy gov after vote of no confidence,"Stakeholders in Ife Federal Constituency of the Peoples Democratic Party in Osun State have reconciled with the state deputy governor, Kola Adewusi, and other leaders in the constituency.

Recall that party leaders and members in the constituency where Adewusi hails from had recently passed a vote of no confidence on him and some other leaders for allegedly romancing with some opposition figures.

It was gathered that the internal wrangling had threatened the unity of the ruling party in the region.

Meanwhile, following intervention by the state governor, Ademola Adeleke, top stakeholders in the constituency met with the deputy governor and other leaders on Friday, where they resolved to give peace a chance, declaring that “Osun PDP is united.”

At the meeting held in Ile-Ife, party leaders were present, including Board of Trustees members, former national secretary Wale Oladipo, deputy governor, the senatorial leader Akin Famuyide, and all the district executives, commissioners and appointees from the district, all the council chairmen, House of Assembly members, and others who matter.

Addressing journalists after the peace parley, the Osun PDP Chairman, Sunday Bisi, explained that the unity meeting aims to foster togetherness among stakeholders in Ife Federal constituency, disclosing that the vote of no confidence previously passed on Adewusi and others has been withdrawn.

He said, “We are in a society. It is not possible for us to live without having this kind of thing once in a while; but we thank God that PDP has an internal mechanism through which we resolve all issues and disputes. We thank God that we have done it here today in Ile-Ife, and peace now reigns, the storm is over, and peace will reign in supreme in Ife PDP and Osun PDP in general.”

Bisi noted that members have been urged to resist further attempts by opposition figures to divide them. “Those external forces that want to cause implosion won’t come back, we have spoken to our people, they won’t allow that or any external interference again in the affairs of the party, we have resolved that one,” he stated.

Regarding the deputy governor running on the same ticket as the governor, the party boss remarked, “Just leave that. You cross the bridge when you get to the river, so let us wait. When the time comes we will tell you.”

Deputy Governor Kola Adewusi, in his remarks to journalists, described the issue as a storm in a teacup, stating that it had been settled, and added, “Let us not drag this issue beyond this limit.”

“Let me just tell you, men of the press, that bygone is bygone. We have forgotten everything that happened in the past, and we have turned over a new leaf. What happened here today is to tell all of you that PDP is one. There is no division between us, and in politics, one cannot rule out the impact of past events.

“Here we are today, we are all together and we are bonded together again; even the tongue and the mouth they do have misunderstandings, but today, the whole thing has been resolved finally and completed. The senatorial chairman is here, along with many others, so I can tell you it was a storm in a teacup; it has now settled, and everything is over.

“Nobody is holding anybody for anything. PDP is united, and we are one. The devil wants to play his game, but we won’t allow the devil to play that game,” he concluded.

In a similar vein, Akindele Famuyide, the senatorial leader for the Osun East Central district who led others in passing the vote of no confidence, noted that it has been withdrawn and that the constituency now has great confidence in the deputy governor and other leaders.

“Like I said, that was a few days ago. A lot of things have happened; the governor came in, and we have our internal mechanism to resolve issues, and it has been completely resolved,” said.

Regarding what led to the crisis, he said, “It was caused by maybe one of our decampees; he was parading and was moving around and we said no, we don’t want to see him near our leaders anymore; that was it.”

He added, “We never had any issues of local government anywhere, nothing of such. The governor has done the right thing, he has taken care of almost everybody; you know it is not possible to take care of everybody; but almost everybody has been touched from all corners of Osun East including Ife zone; you know we are in Ife zone party meeting now, so, he has done his best and we have never had it so good in the history of Ife land. So, we are happy and we are grateful.”",https://guardian.ng/politics/pdp-leaders-in-ife-reconcile-with-osun-deputy-gov-after-vote-of-no-confidence/,https://guardian.ng
"ADC split deepens as faction claims court barred Mark, Aregbesola","• Invites Atiku, Obi, El-Rufai, others to join ‘authentic ADC’

• No injunction against leaders, ADC clarifies, warns public against fake reports

• Court refuses ex-parte bid to stop Mark, Aregbesola as ADC leaders

• Adjourns hearing on leadership tussle till Monday

A faction of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) has claimed that the Federal High Court issued an order restraining former Senate President David Mark, former Osun State Governor Rauf Aregbesola, and others from parading themselves as members of the party’s national executive.

The group said the ruling vindicated its position on the legitimacy of its leadership and reaffirmed its determination to restore the ADC to its “authentic glory.”

Reacting, ADC National Publicity Secretary, Bolaji Abdullahi, in a statement yesterday, dismissed such claims, describing them as the handiwork of “desperate political jobbers” disappointed by the Independent National Electoral Commission’s (INEC) recognition of the new leadership of the party.

Meanwhile, in the contested ruling delivered yesterday, a Federal High Court in Abuja refused an ex-parte application filed by the plaintiff, Nafiu Bala Gombe, a former Deputy National Chairman of the ADC. Instead, it directed that the defendants be put on notice and appear to show cause why the interim injunction should not be granted.

The ADC faction, in a statement signed by its Director of Media and Public Affairs, Dr Christopher O. Okechukwu, extended what it described as a “warm invitation” to political leaders and Nigerians from all walks of life to join its fold.

Okechukwu said: “The Federal High Court’s order restraining David Mark, Rauf Aregbesola, and others from parading themselves as National executive members of the African Democratic Congress has vindicated our position. We welcome this development and reaffirm our commitment to reclaiming and restoring the party to its authentic glory.

“We extend a warm invitation to the following esteemed individuals and groups to join our vibrant and growing family: David Mark; Rauf Aregbesola; Nasir El-Rufai; Atiku Abubakar; Peter Obi; Rotimi Amaechi; all coalition members and the general public.

“Together, we can build a brighter future for our nation. We urge the coalition group to support the legitimate leadership of Nafiu Bala as the National Chairman of ADC. By putting aside our differences and working towards a common goal, we believe that together, we can achieve great things and take our party to new heights.”

The faction added that it was making preparations to ensure membership registration was seamless and accessible nationwide, with membership cards and registers to be distributed across the states.

It also urged Nigerians who shared its vision to join the ADC, which it described as a “dynamic and forward-thinking political party, committed to driving positive change in our nation.”

The statement concluded by stressing that the doors of the party remain open to all Nigerians, while collective effort was crucial to achieving lasting political and economic transformation.

No injunction against leaders, ADC clarifies, warns media, public against fake reports

National Publicity Secretary, Bolaji Abdullahi dismissed reports that the Federal High Court issued an order restraining David Mark and Rauf Aregbesola from acting as the party’s National Chairman and National Secretary, insisting that no injunction was granted against its leadership.

The party described the claims as “fake news”, clarifying that Justice Emeka Nwite refused an ex-parte application filed by Nafiu Bala Gombe. Instead, the judge ordered that the defendants be put on notice and appear to show cause why the application should not be granted, before adjourning the matter till September 15, 2025.

The statement signed by Abdullahi, reads in part: “The African Democratic Congress wishes to set the record straight regarding false reports currently circulating in the media about the recent ruling of the Federal High Court, Abuja, concerning the leadership of our great party.

“Contrary to some misleading publications, the court did not issue any order restraining Senator David Mark and Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola from functioning as the National Chairman and National Secretary of the ADC, respectively.

“Instead, the Honourable Court refused the ex-parte application brought by Nafiu Bala Gombe and directed that the matter proceed with due process,” the statement said.

The party cited the court’s ruling, which explicitly stated that the application filed on September 2, 2025, was refused; that the plaintiff was directed to put the defendants on notice; that the defendants should appear before the court to show cause; and that the case was adjourned to September 15, 2025.

According to the statement, the ruling was duly signed and issued by Justice Emeka Nwite and certified by Kasope Kafayat Bola, Registrar of the Federal High Court.

“Having failed to stop INEC from acknowledging the leadership change in ADC, the political jobbers are now resorting to fake news. This goes to show that these agents of destabilisation will stop at nothing, including misrepresenting court rulings, in their desperate efforts to sow confusion and further undermine opposition parties,” it added.

The party urged journalists and the public to verify reports before publication to avoid misleading Nigerians.

What the Federal High Court resolved

The Federal High Court fixed September 15, 2025, to hear a motion seeking to restrain former Senate President David Mark and former Osun State Governor Rauf Aregbesola from parading themselves as the National Chairman and National Secretary of the African Democratic Congress, respectively.

In the ruling, the court refused an ex-parte application filed by the plaintiff, Nafiu Bala Gombe, a former Deputy National Chairman of the ADC. Instead, it directed that the defendants be put on notice and appear to show cause why the interim injunction should not be granted.

The presiding judge, Justice K.A. Nwite ruled that all parties must be heard before any restraining order is issued and adjourned the matter to September 15.

The suit, marked FHC/ABJ/1819/2025, lists the ADC, Senator David Mark, Rauf Aregbesola, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and Chief Ralph Nwosu as the first to fifth respondents.

Gombe is challenging the legitimacy of the new leadership, insisting that he remains the authentic National Chairman of the party. He is also questioning INEC’s recognition of the Mark-led National Working Committee (NWC), which assumed office after the dissolution of the previous NWC, led by Chief Ralph Nwosu, during the ADC’s 99th National Executive Committee meeting in Abuja.

In the interim, the court directed the defendants not to take any further steps in their claimed capacities until the motion is heard.

Nwosu commends INEC, says recognition of Mark gifts ADC to Anambra

Relatedly, the gubernatorial contender of the African Democratic Congress in Anambra State, John Chuma Nwosu, has commended the Independent National Electoral Commission for regularising the David Mark-led National Working Committee (NWC) of the party.

He said the prompt recognition of the ADC’s national leadership was a major democratic gesture for Anambra voters, stressing that the development came as a much-needed relief at a time the electorate were searching for a credible alternative.

Nwosu noted that Anambra voters found themselves in a similar political situation as in 2003, when the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its leadership grew wanton with impunity as the dominant platform.

“If you recall, the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) appeared as the alternative and Anambra people embraced the party with both hands. Now, 24 years down the line, the same APGA has become inebriated with power and has started treating the people with disdain.

“But, as the light of the nation, God has remembered the state again. And INEC has demonstrated patriotic impartiality by regularising the leadership of ADC. So, I can tell you that the coalition of patriotic opposition politicians would gather in Anambra to begin the journey of national rescue,” the ADC standard-bearer stated.

Nwosu dismissed claims in some quarters that the electoral umpire was merely playing a script to set up ADC for judicial destruction, saying conspiracy theories have no place in the exercise of democratic rights and responsibilities.

He said: “There is no hidden agenda. ADC has come to be; all necessary documentation has been done and the commission has done what it should. Voters now have a credible alternative to the old spoilt platforms that have been taking the masses for a ride.

“On November 8, Anambra people will have room enough to exercise their franchise and elect their governor, a servant leader and not arrogant mischief makers and opportunists. This thing that INEC has done will force all political parties to pursue campaigns based on issues that are relevant to the people.”",https://guardian.ng/politics/adc-split-deepens-as-faction-claims-court-barred-mark-aregbesola/,https://guardian.ng
"Ekiti guber: Fayose backs Oyebanji, says gov will surpass record","• Nothing on ground to justify over N500b allocations, Ojo claims

A Chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, has said that Governor Biodun Oyebanji will break his record and also surpass it.



Fayose said that Oyebanji will also surpass the record by winning in all 177 wards of the state. He noted that Oyebanji showed political strength during his submission of the nomination form in Abuja yesterday.



The former governor said that by the array of political bigwigs that accompanied Oyebanji to submit his party’s nomination form, it should now be clear to those still hanging on false hopes that there will be no vacancy in the Ekiti Government House until 2030.



He said, “The governor will not only break my record of 16 – 0, he will surpass it by winning all 177 wards.” Fayose, who reiterated that he was not a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), stressed that he remained a supporter of Oyebanji and President Bola Tinubu, adding that he owed nobody any apology for doing so.

MEANWHILE, ahead of the Ekiti State governorship primary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), a leading aspirant, Kayode Olubunmi Ojo, insists that there is nothing on the ground to justify the statutory allocation of over N500 billion to the state within the last three years.



Ojo, who spoke to reporters shortly after he submitted his expression of interest and nomination forms to vie for the exalted seat at the party secretariat in Abuja yesterday, expressed optimism that he would upstage Governor Biodun Oyebanji at the party primaries billed to be held on October 27 this year.



He claimed that records show that between November 2022 and June 2025, N292.24 billion was received as federal allocation by the state, with Internally Generated Revenue at N89.6 billion, in addition to federal allocations to local councils exceeding N150 billion, not including various Federal Government interventions and loans.



Ojo, who is rumoured to enjoy the backing of the Presidency, maintained that the funds could have been used to transform the state, stating that instead, under the current administration, there are no “visible results” on the ground to justify the usage of the monies.



Faulting the notion held in certain quarters that he enjoys the support of the Presidency, he pledged to grant full autonomy to local councils in the state if voted into power.",https://guardian.ng/politics/ekiti-guber-fayose-backs-oyebanji-says-gov-will-surpass-record/,https://guardian.ng
"AbdulRazaq, lawmakers’ shadowboxing sets Kwara on edge","Kwara State is in the eye of the storm as a rise in kidnappings amid arrested development compounds the political unease between Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq and federal legislators from the state. Yet, the real undercurrent is the 2027 power tussle and who gets what, MANSUR ARAMIDE reports.

Here is the first potential flashpoint: both incumbent governor, AbdulRazaq AbdulRahman, and Senator Saliu Mustapha, who hail from Kwara Central Senatorial District, want to advance their politics in 2027. And, as the governor serves out his two maximum constitutional terms in 2027, he plans to retire to the Red Chambers of the National Assembly as his colleagues do.

But, having served just a first term, Senator Mustapha looks forward to another term to enjoy the benefits of a ranking Senator and “attract greater dividends to the people of Kwara Central”.

While the governor hails from Ilorin West, Senator Mustapha is from Ilorin East Local Government Area. They are both titleholders in the Ilorin Emirate. The governor is the Sardauna Ngeri of Ilorin Emirate, while the senator is the Turaki Ngeri of Ilorin Emirate. They also belong to the same party, the All Progressives Congress (APC).

But all these shared backgrounds did not stop the Kwara State government, led by AbdulRazaq, from halting the senator’s first-ever flagship project, a N200 million federal road at Adewole Ward, Ilorin West, sometime in 2024.

That episode was followed by a string of other frustrations, with sources putting the value at over N6 billion, including an ultramodern pavilion at the forecourt of the Emir’s Palace in Ilorin and a hospital renovation project at Awodi, Gambari area of Ilorin East, all blocked from execution in controversial circumstances.

For many observers, the Adewole incident was more than a project dispute. It reflected the power struggle between a governor seeking to centralise political loyalty around Government House and a senator intent on carving his own identity as a development-focused legislator. The rivalry has since snowballed into broader political antagonism.

Ashiru and the wind of zoning

The situation is no different in Kwara South. At a news conference in his Offa hometown, Senator Lola Ashiru reportedly drew the ire of the governor by insisting that the governorship position would be contested among all three zones in the state come 2027.

“Zoning arrangements had never been a consideration in the selection of governorship candidates in the state. Governorship is never zoned in Kwara State. Anybody who wants to become governor must be prepared to work hard and campaign hard to convince people to vote for him or her.”

The Guardian learnt that Senator Ashiru’s comments on zoning unsettled the governor’s camp and complicated the senator’s relationship with the governor. From that day onwards, the relationship between the former political associates became strained.

Ashiru’s intervention tapped into a sensitive fault line in Kwara politics. Since the Second Republic, the question of equitable rotation of power among Kwara Central, North, and South has often triggered tension. Although AbdulRazaq himself benefited from the “Otoge” movement that emphasised inclusion and renewal, his camp appears determined to control the succession debate ahead of 2027. Ashiru’s blunt rejection of zoning was therefore interpreted as a challenge to the governor’s succession calculations.

Tijani’s suspense

Tijani Kayode Ismail, representing Ifelodun, Offa, and Oyun Federal Constituency, has also walked a strained path with the governor. Their falling-out, it was learnt, dates back to the last APC primaries when the governor reportedly tried to stop Tijani’s re-election.

Although Tijani survived both the primaries and subsequent legal battles, the scars remain. Since then, the lawmaker has rarely been seen in state political circles, preferring to operate from Abuja.

An elder in Offa, Jide Alabi, told The Guardian that the relationship between the governor and Tijani is almost irreparably lost, and the two of them are not pretending about it.

“Tijani has been disgusted by the Governor’s conduct during the primaries. He considered it a betrayal. Fortunately for him, he was able to prove his mettle politically when he ensured that he defeated the governor’s anointed at the primaries. So, since then, he has completely withdrawn from government circles. And he’s also rarely seen in the state. But that withdrawal comes at a cost to his constituents.”

Legislators boycott First Lady’s visit

Matters, however, came to a head in January during the visit of First Lady Oluremi Tinubu. Out of nine federal legislators from the state, only two, Senator Sodiq Umar and Muktar Shagaya, attended the three-day programme. Both Mustapha, Ashiru, and four other legislators were conspicuously absent, further fuelling speculation of the infighting.

However, several sources around the legislators confirmed to our correspondent that the state government did not invite the lawmakers to the state visit of the First Lady. A source close to Ashiru confirmed that his principal was never formally invited. He further claimed that it was the same experience for other federal legislators.

“Everyone in the state knew that Senator Sodiq attended by accident. Like the other two, he wasn’t invited, but out of respect for the First Lady, he made an appearance somehow in between events,” he said.

“The boycott spoke louder than words,” said a senior lecturer at the University of Ilorin, Dr Bolaji Ataragba. “When lawmakers distance themselves from such a high-profile visit, it confirms the existence of a deep rift.”

The absence also sent a strong message to Abuja. In Nigerian political culture, presidential or first-lady visits are typically opportunities for local politicians to showcase unity and curry favour. The disunity on display in Kwara was therefore interpreted in some quarters as evidence of a political cold war.

Silence, insecurity

As insecurity worsens, particularly in Kwara South and parts of the North, the silence of the federal lawmakers has drawn criticism. Farmers are abandoning their fields, villages live in fear, and families grieve the loss of kidnapped loved ones. Yet, Abuja’s representatives have not raised the matter with urgency.

As the insecurity crisis deepens, the cost of the rift becomes clearer. Federal legislators are constitutionally positioned to draw Abuja’s attention to the plight of their state, lobby for interventions, and complement state government efforts. Their silence leaves the governor isolated and citizens vulnerable.

“This is not the time for silence,” said Kayode Ogunlowo, a social critic and chieftain of the APC, while speaking over the weekend on a popular radio programme. “Our people are suffering. Whether or not you get along with the governor, the first duty is to your constituents. The silence is both puzzling and painful.”

Also commenting on the issue, an elder statesman, Alhaji Baba Adedoyin, wondered why elected officials under the same party would be working at cross-purposes the way it is in Kwara State. He said both the governor and the legislators are merely playing to the gallery.

“The bandits must be somewhere laughing at them all. While our leaders quarrel, the bandits prosper. But history is watching. Kwarans know who spoke for them and who kept quiet.”

Meanwhile, those close to the legislators insist their caution is not without reason. The governor, they say, is a difficult man to read. “Governor AbdulRazaq is best handled at arm’s length,” an aide to one of the lawmakers explained. “If you do too much, you risk being accused of outshining him. If you do less, you may be branded disloyal. Nobody wants to fall on the wrong side, that’s why so many of them have chosen silence.”

This perception of a governor intolerant of competing political influence has been echoed even among civil society groups. Critics argue that while AbdulRazaq has recorded some successes in education, infrastructure, and social interventions, he has not mastered the art of managing political egos, a skill that was crucial in the state’s Otoge victory of 2019.

What’s in it for Kwara

This political tension between the governor and the lawmakers has only but led to a peculiar situation: a governor fighting insecurity and development battles almost alone, and lawmakers who feel safer staying aloof than being misunderstood.

The irony of the moment is not lost on the citizens of Kwara. In 2019, the Otoge movement brought down the Saraki dynasty with a promise of collective renewal. Stakeholders rallied together in a historic moment of political unity. Barely five years later, that unity has unravelled into competing camps and silent rivalries.

The Otoge struggle was not just an anti-Saraki revolt; it was a call for inclusiveness, service delivery, and accountable governance. Yet today, the movement’s victors are themselves accused of division and insensitivity. Many Kwarans now wonder whether the promise of 2019 was betrayed by personal ambitions.

Kwara today stands at a crossroads. The state can either rediscover the collaborative spirit that defined the Otoge struggle or risk sliding further and deeper into a politics of division that undermines both development and security.

Analysts warn that unless bridges are rebuilt, the state may approach the 2027 elections with fractured leadership, leaving room for opposition revival. For citizens facing hunger, unemployment, and banditry, the luxury of elite quarrels is fast wearing thin.",https://guardian.ng/politics/abdulrazaq-lawmakers-shadowboxing-sets-kwara-on-edge/,https://guardian.ng
"ADC denies court injunction against Mark, Aregbesola","The African Democratic Congress (ADC) has dismissed media reports claiming that a Federal High Court in Abuja granted an injunction restraining Senator David Mark and Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola from serving as the party’s national chairman and national secretary.

In a statement on Thursday, signed by ADC National Publicity Secretary Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi, the party clarified that the court, presided over by Justice Emeka Nwite, declined to grant an ex parte application filed by Hon. Nafiu Bala Gombe on September 4, 2025.

Instead, the judge ordered that the defendants be served notice and appear in court to show cause why the application should not be granted. The matter was adjourned to September 15, 2025.

“The court did not issue any restraining order,” the statement read. “Instead, it followed due process and directed the parties involved to appear and respond accordingly.”

The ADC described the reports as “fake news” spread by “desperate political jobbers” seeking to destabilize the party after failing to stop the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from recognizing its new leadership.

The party urged media organizations and the public to be cautious about misinformation and misrepresentation of legal proceedings, noting that all court orders were duly signed by Justice Nwite and certified by the court registrar, Kasope Kafayat Bola.",https://guardian.ng/politics/adc-denies-court-injunction-against-mark-aregbesola/,https://guardian.ng
"INEC rejects 157 applications, clears ADA, 13 others for party registration","The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Thursday, said 14 associations seeking to register as political parties have been cleared to proceed to the next stage of the registration process, while 157 others were rejected for failing to meet constitutional and legal requirements.

The Commission, in a statement signed by National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Sam Olumekun, disclosed that out of 171 requests received, only 14 scaled through the preliminary assessment.

According to a document released by INEC, those cleared include African Transformation Party (ATP), All Democratic Alliance (ADA), Advance Nigeria Congress (ANC), Abundance Social Party (ASP), African Alliance Party (AAP), Citizens Democratic Alliance (CDA), and Democratic Leadership Alliance (DLA).

Others were the Grassroots Initiative Party (GRIP), Green Future Party (GFP), Liberation People’s Party (LPP), National Democratic Party (NDP), National Reform Party (NRP), Patriotic Peoples Alliance (PPA) and Peoples Freedom Party (PFP).

Olumekun said each application was scrutinised against Section 222 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), Section 79 (1, 2, and 4) of the Electoral Act 2022, and Clause 2 (i and ii) of the Commission’s Regulations and Guidelines for Political Parties 2022.

He explained that the clearance does not amount to full registration, stressing that the final determination of their registrability would only be made after INEC’s physical verification of all claims made by the groups.

“Out of the total number of applications received, 14 associations have met the requirements to proceed to the next stage while 157 have not. The Commission shall officially communicate the decision arising from today’s meeting to all the associations in the next 24 hours,” he said.

“Meanwhile, the list of the 14 pre-qualified associations has been published on our website and other official platforms for public information.”

Olumekun said interim Chairmen and Secretaries of the pre-qualified associations are invited to a briefing on Wednesday, September 17, 2025, at 11:00 am at the Commission’s Headquarters in Abuja.

According to him, in addition to uploading the required information to the portal, they will physically verify all claims by each association in line with our Regulations and Guidelines.

“The final determination of the registrability of the associations as political parties will be made after the physical verification of all their claims to determine compliance with the legal framework,” he said.

"APC criticises Obi’s stance on borrowing, questions his moral authority","The Lagos State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has criticised former Anambra State Governor Peter Obi’s comments on government borrowing, dismissing his critique as lacking substance, and noting that his criticism contradicts his governance records.

In a statement on Thursday issued by Lagos APC Spokesman Mogaji Seye Oladejo, the party urged Obi to focus on areas where he has demonstrated strength, suggesting his interventions on financial and economic matters expose a “shallow grasp of issues.”

Oladejo stated that borrowing is not inherently reckless when tied to strategic purposes like infrastructure development, energy, and productive sectors – pointing to President Bola Tinubu’s administration as employing borrowing for critical growth areas.

He contrasted this with Obi’s record as governor, citing unpaid pensions, deteriorated infrastructure, and poor human capital outcomes in Anambra State, questioning Obi’s moral authority to speak on prudence, and referencing his appearance in the Pandora Papers related to offshore accounts and hidden assets.

Oladejo juxtaposed Obi’s past actions, like campaigning with private jet travel while advocating cost-cutting, with President Tinubu’s economic reforms including subsidy removal and currency adjustments, labeling the latter as “leadership in action.”

The APC expressed reservations about Obi’s commentary on financial and economic matters, saying these topics highlight his limitations.

He said: “Borrowing is not inherently reckless. What matters is purpose and prudence. Under President Tinubu, borrowing is strategic, tied to critical infrastructure, energy, transportation, and productive sectors. This is the globally accepted practice – even the most advanced economies borrow to fund growth.

“Obi has no moral authority to lecture anyone about prudence. Nigerians remember that as governor, he left behind unpaid pensions, collapsing infrastructure, and poor human capital indices. His much-advertised ‘savings’ were idle balances lodged in banks, not real investments that created jobs or improved livelihoods. Ironically, he boasted of investing public funds in breweries – yet today preaches about prudence.

“Unlike Obi’s motivational-speech politics, President Tinubu is taking bold, necessary steps to reset the economy. Subsidy removal, currency reforms, and targeted borrowing are difficult but inevitable measures to secure Nigeria’s future. This is leadership in action – not empty moralising.

“We, therefore, urge Mr. Obi, with all due respect, to conserve his health and stick to areas where his talent lies: populist rhetoric, electioneering platitudes, and recycled campaign speeches. On serious matters of finance and governance, he is out of depth and out of place.”",https://guardian.ng/politics/apc-criticises-obis-stance-on-borrowing-questions-his-moral-authority/,https://guardian.ng
Tiwa Savage’s new album “This One Is Personal” takes us deep into her most intimate experiences with love and lays bare her vulnerabilities,"In her latest album, “This One is Personal”, Tiwa Savage invites listeners into an intimate exploration of love and heartbreak.

Tiwa Savage’s latest album, “This One Is Personal ”has me feeling all kinds of emotions. This debut marks her fourth studio album, released under the Everything Savage and EMPIRE records partnership. Tiwa Savage has worked hard to establish herself as one of the most successful African female artists globally. We first encountered Tiwa Savage’s sound with her hit single “Kele Kele Love” released in 2010. From then, she has stayed on our speakers and the top charts with hits like “Koroba”, “Loaded” ft Asake, “Somebody’s son” ft Brandy and “Stamina.”

When Tiwa Savage is featured on a remix, she instantly elevates the track. Her star power makes these songs popular hits. With verses on “Who is your guy” ft Spyro and “No Wahala” ft 1da Banton and Kizz Daniel, she demonstrates her mastery of collaboration. She is a dynamic powerhouse who starred in and executive produced a Prime movie “Water and Garri”. She also performed at King Charles III’s coronation concert in the United Kingdom. Her latest album “This One Is Personal” showcases her signature blend of Afrobeats, R&B and soulful melodies. These tracks showcase her vocal talent and her ability to delve deeply into herself to share her emotional journey with love.

A 15-track album where R&B meets raw, vulnerable storytelling

For this 15-track album, she leans more into the R&B genre, already earning a number 1 spot on the UK iTunes R&B/ Soul charts. The album’s first track, “I’m Done”, a ballad over a soothing piano and violin arrangement, has her singing “I don’t want to love again, I am finished, I’m done.” Speaking on the direction of the album, Tiwa says, “It’s the most vulnerable I’ve ever been on a record. Every single record resonates with an experience I’ve gone through. It took two years to do this record.” The album samples Canadian singer Tamia’s popular song “So into you” on the third track “You4Me”. Where she declares that “It’s only you for me, oh, I’m into you.”

It becomes clear after hearing the first few songs on the album that Tiwa wants to share her experiences with love and relationships. She sings about finding the one, having a secret love affair and what it feels like to be completely done with a relationship. This angle is important for women everywhere who are also going through similar experiences. In her 40s, Tiwa Savage brings a seasoned perspective to love and relationships, reflecting the growth, and wisdom that come with age. She opens up about her complicated relationship with romance, love, and even looking for someone to be with. Through her music, Tiwa invites listeners into her world, offering up her vulnerability and strength through her lyrics. Her storytelling and experiences resonate deeply. Making the album not just a personal expression but a relatable journey for many women.

Finding strength in her most vulnerable track, “Scared of Love”

Track 9, “Scared of Love,” stands out as one of the most revealing moments on the album. With lyrics like “We can be scared of love, scared of messing up, scared it’s not enough”. Tiwa Savage explores the vulnerability and fear that often come with opening one’s heart again after heartbreak. The raw honesty of the song shines through in her powerful voice. She proclaims that despite all the risks, she is no longer afraid to confront love head on. This track feels like an anthem for anyone learning to trust again after emotional wounds.

This vulnerability is deeply connected to Tiwa’s own life. Her highly publicised divorce in 2016 from Tunji “Tee Billz” Balogun. Left a lasting mark on her personal and public narrative. Following the split, she shared a candid story addressing the breakdown of their marriage and her emotional struggles in a YouTube video.

The release of her leaked sex tape was not just a public scandal but an act of revenge porn, a personal attack on the singer’s reputation. Instead of receiving support for this criminal violation against her, she was scrutinised and vilified. Demonstrating the complicated environment Nigerian female musicians have to tackle after becoming a household name. Rather than shy away from the pain, Tiwa chose to speak her truth. That same bravery echoes in “Scared of Love.” The song feels like a continuation of her healing journey. One where she’s no longer hiding her scars but embracing them as part of her story. The song ends with these final lyrics “Pray for me and you”.

An album that reflects the complexities of love

Songs like “Will I Run Again” and “You’re not the first (You’re just the worst)” show how much Tiwa has reflected on the version of herself that participated in these relationships. The last track, “Change” offers a conflicting end to the album. With lyrics like “Just tell me what to change into, cause I wanna be the one in love with you, Let me change into someone new, Doesn’t matter who if they fall in love with you.” Tiwa wrestles with the tension between self-identity and the desire to be loved.

The album offers a sincere reflection on how far someone might be prepared to go for love. Even if it means sacrificing parts of themselves along the way. Tiwa Savage’s latest album, “This One is Personal” is a heartfelt reflection of love and resilience. Through deeply personal lyrics, she continues to empower women by speaking openly about her own emotional journey. At 45, Tiwa proves that vulnerability is a healing and that it’s never too late to rediscover love on your own terms.

The ultimate fashion and beauty tips for expectant mothers to rock their baby bump with confidence,"Your style and beauty care naturally evolve with the different seasons of life. Pregnancy is no exception. These tips will help you style your baby bump while pairing it with the right beauty routine to keep you glowing throughout the journey.

One of the things pregnant women often worry about is how to maintain their sense of style while growing a baby bump. Pregnancy is a transformative and deeply personal journey, so your personal style still deserves to shine through. The good news is that fashion and beauty do not have to be sacrificed during these nine months. In fact, this season can be an opportunity to redefine your wardrobe, embrace body confidence, and explore new ways of expressing yourself.

Styling your baby bump is about comfort while celebrating your changing body and feeling beautiful throughout the journey. Maternity style is versatile and creative.

Pregnancy also brings unique skincare needs, making beauty a vital part of the conversation. Here’s a complete guide on how to style your baby bump while keeping your skin glowing and radiant.

Embrace stretchy, comfortable fabrics

An easy way to style your baby bump is by investing in fabrics that stretch and move with your body. Jersey, cotton blends, and knits allow you to stay stylish without compromising comfort. Bodycon dresses, once seen as unsuitable for pregnancy, are now a bold choice for pregnant women who want to flaunt their baby bump.

Style tip: Pair a fitted dress with a lightweight blazer or kimono for an elevated yet comfortable look.

Don’t shy away from bright colours and prints

Pregnancy does not mean your style should fade into neutral palettes. In fact, bright colours and prints are powerful style statements that flatter you and uplift your mood. Print wrap dresses, brightly coloured blouses, or a printed maxi dress can create a vibrant, eye-catching maternity wardrobe. When styled with minimal accessories, these outfits allow your bump to become the natural focal point.

Style tip: Choose breathable fabrics like cotton or chiffon when wearing bold prints. They keep you comfortable, prevent overheating, and ensure that your colourful look feels as effortless as it appears.

Invest in timeless wardrobe staples

Avoid an overwhelming maternity wardrobe. A few versatile staples can go a long way. Think maternity jeans, oversized shirts, stretchy camisoles, a classic wrap dress, and maxi dresses or co-ords. These pieces can be mixed and matched with your pre-pregnancy wardrobe. To make them last beyond pregnancy, choose cuts and styles that transition easily into postpartum style. For example, wrap dresses are not only flattering on your baby bump; they can double as breastfeeding-friendly outfits.

Style tip: Stay true to your personal style. Many maternity pieces mirror the trends and silhouettes you already love, so look out for designs that align with your usual wardrobe. That way, you’ll feel stylish and confident throughout pregnancy and beyond.

Bare the bump with confidence

Gone are the days when pregnancy style meant hiding your body under layers. Today, flaunting your bare bump is a statement of confidence, individuality, and celebration of motherhood. Rihanna set the tone during her first pregnancy. Now in her third pregnancy, she has redefined maternity fashion with crop tops, low-rise trousers, sheer dresses, and body-hugging outfits that proudly showcase her baby bump. Her bold looks have proven that pregnancy doesn’t have to limit your fashion choices — it can actually expand them.

However, you don’t have to go all-out like Rihanna to embrace this trend. Simple styling tricks can go a long way. You can pair a crop top with a maxi skirt, try a cut-out dress, or layer a sheer blouse over a bralette. This can highlight your bump in a chic, comfortable way. The key is to choose fabrics that stretch and breathe while making you feel powerful.

Style tip: If you’re baring your baby bump, balance it with more modest pieces like wide-leg trousers or a long skirt for a sophisticated, fashion-forward look.

Accessorise creatively

Accessories are your best friend during pregnancy. Statement earrings, scarves, and handbags allow you to stay stylish without needing a new wardrobe every month. Belts, in particular, can be used to highlight your baby bump — style them just above your belly for a chic silhouette. Hats and sunglasses also elevate even the simplest maternity outfit while protecting your skin from sun damage.

Style tip: Pick lightweight, comfortable accessories that don’t add unnecessary bulk. A slim belt or delicate layered jewellery can enhance your look without overwhelming your frame.

Comfortable and stylish shoes are your besties

As your pregnancy advances, swelling in your feet may occur, making the choice of footwear crucial. Swap towering heels for stylish flats, wedges, or supportive sneakers. Loafers, ballet flats, and cushioned sandals can give you that chic look while keeping your body balanced and your feet pain-free.

Style tip: Choose shoes with adjustable straps or elastic details to accommodate swelling. Add some fun with colours — red, pastel pink, or even metallics — to brighten up your maternity outfits. Neutrals such as black, nude, or tan also keep things versatile.

Beauty tips for a glowing skin during pregnancy

Pregnancy glow is real, but so are the hormonal changes that affect the skin. Black women, in particular, may experience hyperpigmentation, dryness, or melasma during this time. Here’s how to care for your skin while styling your baby bump:

Hydration is key

Drink plenty of water and use a hydrating moisturiser rich in shea butter or glycerin. These help maintain skin elasticity and prevent dryness.

Hyaluronic acid

Safe for pregnancy, this powerhouse ingredient keeps skin plump and glowing without causing irritation.

Safe brightening option

Pregnant women often experience skin discolouration. Opt for Vitamin C serums to even out skin tone and maintain collagen. Avoid harsh products like retinols and hydroquinone, which are not safe for use during pregnancy.

Sun protection

Your skin needs sunscreen no matter the season. If you choose to bare your baby bump, you also need to apply sunscreen on it. Choose a broad-spectrum, fragrance-free, mineral-based SPF 30 or higher that leaves no white cast.

Gentle exfoliation

Being pregnant doesn’t mean you should skip exfoliation. Gentle exfoliation improves your skin tone and removes dead skin cells. Use a mild exfoliant once a week to help with skin cell turnover and maintain radiance.

Loving your postpartum body

Styling your baby bump is about embracing change. Pregnancy is a miraculous transformation, and your body deserves to be celebrated, not hidden. Whether you prefer fitted dresses that flaunt your bump or oversized tops that prioritise comfort, the most important thing is to wear what makes you feel good.

By combining maternity fashion with thoughtful beauty care, you create a lifestyle that uplifts you through every trimester.

Heineken Lagos Fashion Week opens applications for Green Access 2025 as part of 15th anniversary celebrations,"Lagos Fashion Week has announced that applications are now open for Green Access 2025, its flagship accelerator program dedicated to shaping the future of African fashion.

As part of its 15th-anniversary celebrations, the 2025 Lagos Fashion Week Green Access challenges emerging designers to transform pre- and post-consumer textile waste into sustainable designs rooted in Africa’s rich craftsmanship.

Since its inception, Green Access has been instrumental in nurturing a new generation of designers committed to circularity and sustainable practices. Alumni have gone on to build innovative brands that continue to redefine the essence of responsible production. Past participants, such as Kadiju, Pepperrow, Cute Saint, Ywande, Desiree Iyama, Ajanée, Pettre Taylor, and Oshobor exemplify how the program equips designers to combine creativity, cultural storytelling, and commercial impact.

“Green Access is more than a program: it’s a movement that empowers young designers to imagine new possibilities for African fashion while honouring the traditions that shape our identity,” said Omoyemi Akerele, Founder & Convener of Lagos Fashion Week. “As we mark 15 years of Lagos Fashion Week, we remain committed to fostering innovation that is bold, creative, and regenerative.”

The 2024 cohort included designers Samiat Salami (Oya Abeo), Bella Adeleke (Garbe), and Rosette Ale (Revival London). Their work showcased how Green Access equips emerging talent to navigate creative challenges while producing designs that are both commercially and culturally resonant. Through mentorship, skills development, and platform exposure, Green Access drives sustainable growth in African fashion. It is also shaping a new generation of designers who honour heritage while redefining industry standards.

Green Access 2025 will guide participants through four core areas:

Craft-driven innovation: Transforming discarded textiles using traditional African techniques such as weaving, embroidery, and dyeing.

Reimagining Waste: Breathing new life into deadstock and used clothing through reconstruction and modular design.

Youth Activation: Collaborating with young artisans to promote skill-sharing, community engagement, and income generation.

Digital Exploration: Integrating modern technologies such as 3D printing into heritage-based circular design.

Green Access residency at Nahous

To elevate the experience, Lagos Fashion Week is partnering with NAHOUS, a multidisciplinary destination within the restored Old Federal Palace Hotel.

Green Access designers will also participate in a one-week residency at NAHOUS to develop capsule collections. There, they will engage with a curated community of industry tastemakers in a hands-on, collaborative, and inspiring creative process.

Program timeline

The hybrid accelerator begins with three weeks of virtual sessions, followed by the physical residency at NAHOUS. Each participant will produce a three-look capsule collection to be showcased on the Lagos Fashion Week runway this October.

Applications are open to emerging designers in or connected to Nigeria until 19 September 2025. Apply here.

Key dates

Green Access applications open on 11 August 2025 and close 19 September 2025

Runway Shows (onsite & offsite): Oct. 29 – Nov. 2, 2025

“There is no reason why so much is still unknown about the female body in 2025” — My 14-year struggle with chronic period pain and fighting for the right diagnosis,"In this powerful personal essay, guest contributor Boluwatife Olusola-Ajayi shares the raw, unfiltered reality of living with undiagnosed chronic period pain.

“You are now a woman,” my mother said proudly after my period started, but I didn’t feel pride. I felt only betrayal; like I was being punished for a crime I didn’t commit. I felt as though something had gone horribly wrong somewhere, and there was nothing I could do to fix it. Though there were burn marks on my lower belly from my hot water bottle, I still preferred the sting of the boiling water on my skin to the pain inside me.

My periods hurt, and they have for 14 years. I always find myself throwing up till my stomach is empty, leaving nothing but bile. Bitter, disgusting bile. Choosing to lie on the floor because I imagined its coolness would bring me some relief. It never did. I found myself turning and tossing every way, just like I did on my bed. In the early days, I passed out often. After long hours of dealing with the pain and the dehydration from the vomit, I felt my body give in. I knew relief was on the way when I felt a distinct sensation on my face that preceded my passing out. I’d wake up, still in a bit of pain, but the worst is usually over after that.

A childhood shaped by relentless pain

I went to the doctor early on, I was told to be lucky that I didn’t have to be hospitalised every month like some other women. I’m not entirely sure why we didn’t consult another doctor , but I learnt to accept this as my new normal. Some relief came when I discovered a particular pain medication. Unfortunately, it was always conditional; if I didn’t swallow the capsules within minutes, I was, for lack of a better word, finished. Desperate for more consistent relief, I started experimenting: turmeric, honey, warm water — anything. It worked for a while, but like other remedies I had tried, nothing quite fixed it.

Beyond the pain, this condition stole a lot from me, too. During a major WAEC exam, my hands shook so violently from cramps that I could barely write my own name. It felt like what I imagine being pushed back and forth on a fence with jagged bottles would feel like. I had studied for months, but it didn’t matter. My brain couldn’t weave three consecutive sentences together. All I could do was cry while trying not to throw up all over my answer sheet.

I mapped my entire life around my cycle so I could nurse my pain at home without drawing public attention. Once, I miscalculated the dates, and my uncle had to carry me out of the stadium during my school’s sports event. At that moment, my legs no longer remembered why they were attached to my body. I still remember the confused stares and the whispers that followed us as we made our way to the car. For years, I lived without clarity, but as I grew into adulthood, the lack of answers weighed on me in a way I could no longer ignore.

How my search for answers led to my surgery

Two years ago, I began investigating, I was poked and prodded so many times that I knew all the laboratory instructions by heart. I knew what not to wear to make the process go faster. I was tested by lab techs who were too indifferent. Perhaps because what was monumental for me was simply routine for them. I had also not considered the hours I’d lose to long waiting times at the hospital.

After extensive testing, the doctors finally named the rare combination that had haunted me for so long. Teratoma and fibroids: two terrible twins. Both individual conduits of pain, they ganged up on my body in the cruellest way. As I watched my sister burst into tears during one of my hospital visits that confirmed the necessity of a surgical response, it was, perhaps, the first time I let the severity of my diagnosis sink in. So, I prepared for the first surgery of my life.I won’t bore you with the details of how anxiety sat me down and held my neck.

Almost halfway into the procedure, the machines I was hooked up to began to scream all at once. I started to feel faint, my ears ringing, almost as though I was leaving my body. I recall hearing different voices calling my name over and over while the machines beeped loudly in the background. A few seconds that felt like a lifetime later, I was able to reply, “I’m here”. The room quietened almost immediately, the doctors continued, and shortly after, discovered the presence of an endometrioma, a severe type of endometriosis. I had not hallucinated or exaggerated it. My pain was real.

Later, watching the video my doctor had made when the endometriosis was discovered, made it even more real. I sat in stunned silence, completely floored that all those years of pain had led to that moment in the operating room. When I could finally speak, I whispered “Jesus,” and held a shaking hand over my mouth while my heart thumped away in my chest. Seeing it meant the findings in my medical reports were not just complicated medical jargon on a page. It was right there before my eyes on the screen.

For days after the surgery, I leaned on others for literally everything. I kept thinking, “I’d never have gone through with this if I had known just how much it would take from me.” For someone so deeply independent, I struggled so much. Going through recovery was a hard thing. A very hard thing. When I remember that I endured all that pain for most of my life, I just want to hug ten-year-old me. She didn’t deserve to have her transition from girlhood to womanhood plagued by unimaginable pain. I’m choosing to believe that the procedure was wholly successful. I am refusing to dwell on the possibility of needing more procedures. For now, I heal.

A sad reality when women’s health remains without answers

It should not take this long. There is absolutely no reason why, in 2025, so much is unknown about the female body. It makes no sense to me that, despite all the seemingly impossible feats humans have accomplished, doctors still cannot give clear answers. They use “may” far more often than “is” when explaining the causes of these issues. The fact that many of the available treatments are not permanent fixes is maddening. Doctors even admit, “This could come back, even after surgery,” despite the procedures being incredibly invasive, painful, and nerve-wracking.

Facing the possibility of having several procedures over the years, just to have a semblance of what life feels like without pain, is exhausting. I think of many women who have been dismissed or called weak or dramatic. Those who never got an answer. Those who carry their pain in silence. You’re not unstable. It should not be this hard.",https://marieclaire.ng/there-is-no-reason-why-so-much-is-still-unknown-about-the-female-body-in-2025-my-14-year-struggle-with-chronic-period-pain-and-fighting-for-the-right-diagnosis/,https://guardian.ng
Old Nollywood portrayed women through stereotypes that rarely reflected the realities of womanhood,"Old Nollywood gave us iconic women characters, but many of them were filled with stereotypes that rarely portrayed them without bias or showed the true realities of women.

Old Nollywood was instrumental in shaping my initial understanding of women’s stories on screen. Those dramatic “poor girl marries rich man” plots gave the illusion that men were inherently women’s saviours. At the centre of many of these stories were women — mothers, daughters, wives, lovers. They carried a great deal of the drama. However, when you look closer, you start to see how those portrayals weren’t always fair.

They entertained us — unforgettable one-liners from Mama G and the exaggerated tropes of heartbroken women come to mind. However, they also boxed women into narrow roles and sometimes even scared us into being “good girls.” Looking back now, I find myself asking: Did those movies and soap operas really reflect women’s true lives?

In these characters, women were central to the plot but often boxed in

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Superstory (@superstoryseries)

In old Nollywood, women were everywhere. From Blood Sisters (2003), where the bond between two sisters spiralled into jealousy and tragedy, to Super Story’s countless melodramas, women’s stories often drove the plot. Even in Jenifa (2008), one of Funke Akindele’s most iconic roles gave us a bold, funny, and chaotic female character.

However, old Nollywood rarely showed women in their full, nuanced complexity, even though they were at the centre of these movies. Old Nollywood often gave us extremes. The woman was either the saintly mother suffering for her children, the scheming mistress destroying marriages, or the naive girl punished for wanting too much.

Some of the recurring stereotypes

These roles ring true about real-life people but were also limiting.

If you watched enough old Nollywood movies, you probably noticed these patterns:

The wicked stepmother who made life unbearable for her stepchildren.

The desperate single woman whose only goal was marriage.

The “good wife” who endured suffering and injustice in silence until she was finally rewarded.

The bad girl whose “immoral” choices always led to her downfall.

The wealthy woman who had to hide her success to secure and keep a man. Time and time again, rich single women couldn’t find love unless they pretended to be poor. It was as if being independent or wealthy automatically made these characters “undeserving” of affection.

The sexual purity standard. A woman’s worth was often tied to her virginity or her ability to remain “chaste.” If she wasn’t “pure,” the story usually punished her with shame, rejection, or tragedy.

And here’s the thing: these stories didn’t just entertain, they were didactic. Women were often punished for being bold, ambitious, or sexually free. Stories from old Nollywood often made it clear that if you wanted a happy ending, you had to be the “good girl.” The “good girl” in old Nollywood painted women as obedient, patient and selfless to a fault. She lets everything slide – abuse, betrayal or humiliation – just to keep peace or be seen as worthy. In society’s eye, she symbolised virtue, but underneath, she was a flat character with no depth or identity of her own. This trope conveyed society’s patriarchy-inspired expectations of women. It was a constant warning presented to women on how to behave because anything short meant disgrace, heartbreak, or even death – like Itohan in Super Story. It was fear-mongering disguised as morality.

The complicated truth about representation

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Superstory (@superstoryseries)

Still, it wasn’t all negative. Old Nollywood gave women visibility in a way that was rare at the time. One might argue that we had lead female characters long before Hollywood started loudly celebrating their representation. Many actresses, such as Genevieve Nnaji, Stella Damasus, Rita Dominic, Ini Edo, Stephanie Okereke, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde, and Funke Akindele, shaped how an entire generation viewed women on screen.

However, these portrayals reflected society’s anxieties about women more than real women’s lives. Many of these anxieties revolved around control, morality, and maintaining the patriarchal nature of our social order. For example, there was a clear bias against independent women — those who sought education, wealth, or careers — because they challenged traditional family and gender roles. Sexuality was another big concern; women were often expected to remain “pure,” and stories punished those who didn’t conform. We saw countless stories of girls and women dying from botched abortions. The lesson was always delivered in an attempt to discourage women from seeking abortions.

Old Nollywood often followed society’s framing of women’s success and ambition as dangerous or threatening. This is why we often saw wealthy female characters hiding their success or “pretending” to be less than they were. Even friendship and rivalry were used to show that women could not be trusted if they stepped outside the expected roles. In short, old Nollywood often dramatised women’s choices as moral tests, reflecting a society vehemently against changing gender dynamics, more than portraying women authentically.

Old Nollywood remains classic, but it was flawed

At the end of the day, old Nollywood is untouchable in its own way. The unhinged drama, over-the-top acting and the unforgettable storylines have become part of pop culture history. Even with all the stereotypes, those films gave us iconic performances and moments we’ll never forget.

Still, as much as we love them, we can admit they didn’t always capture and, in fact, often warped the full reality of women’s experiences. And that’s why new Nollywood feels refreshing — even though it still has a long way to go. Its storytelling is more nuanced and diverse. It allows women to be ambitious, complex, and real. Although old Nollywood will always be classic, new Nollywood gives women the freedom to exist beyond stereotypes.

"Alexander Amosu brings Africa’s luxury renaissance to Lagos through the Lux Afrique Jewellery, Watch & Home Expo","With the launch of LAJWH Expo, founder Alexander Amosu speaks to us about showcasing African craftsmanship alongside putting Lagos on the global luxury map.

Lagos has always thrived on vibrant energy and entrepreneurial drive, but this year it will also become home to Africa’s first dedicated luxury trade experience. The LAJWH Expo (Luxury, Art, Jewellery, Watches and Home), founded by global entrepreneur Alexander Amosu, marks a daring new chapter for Africa. This event will position the continent not only as a consumer of luxury but also as an active creator and driver of the industry.

Alexander Amosu, the founder of Lux Afrique, is no stranger to pioneering new initiatives. Within the Lux Afrique group, they offer concierge services, an e-commerce business, and curated events, including the Lux Afrique Polo event. Drawing an audience of more than 4,500 to the Polo event, he demonstrated that the demand for premium experiences is not only present but thriving. With LAJWH Expo, Lagos will host a Harrods-style immersive showcase for the first time. Featuring rare timepieces, fine jewellery, collectable homeware, luxury automobiles, and more, the expo brings global names and African talent under one roof.

The motivation behind LAJWH Expo is as strategic as it is cultural. Nigeria and South Africa are among the largest luxury spenders in Africa, with a growing class of high-net-worth individuals. Yet international luxury brands have often struggled to enter this market effectively, facing challenges with distribution and misconceptions about doing business in Nigeria.

In this exclusive interview, Alexander Amosu speaks about the LAJWH Expo directly bridging this gap. It offers international brands a curated entry point while creating space for local artisans and designers to share the spotlight. Amosu is making a powerful statement that the world can no longer ignore the continent’s place in the global luxury conversation.

What’s the vision behind the Lux Afrique Jewellery Watch & Home Expo?

The vision behind it is simple: Nigeria is a fast-growing market, and the people love luxury. I am creating a Harrods-like experience, where you can see the brands of your choice, speak to the owners and network with them. You could be a distributor or a consumer. We will also use the opportunity to bring more focus and attention to the Nigerian market when it comes to luxury.

Based on my experience and 20 years in the luxury sector, I have met brands interested in the Nigerian market. The first question they ask me is, “How do we enter the market and meet other distributors, retailers, professionals, entrepreneurs, and high-level individuals?” They want to learn how to explore the Nigerian market, who to meet and where to go. There’s a lot of scepticism and curiosity about the Nigerian market. I’ve always tried to connect people, but at some point, I thought — why not bring the brands together to exhibit over a two-day period? This way, Nigerians can explore the collections firsthand, meet the brands directly, and even buy from them. So we’re killing two birds with one stone.

You’ve had an inspiring journey as a global entrepreneur with over 20 years experience. Why was it important for you to invest into Africa through a project like this?

I was born in the UK to Nigerian parents, so Nigeria has always held my heart. My soul feels very vibrant when I’m here, and if there’s any country where I can bring and contribute to any brand, it would be Nigeria. I haven’t been back here for a very long time, and I felt it was an opportunity for me to reconnect and also bring something that could be more long-term.

Outside of that, if we look at statistics, there are two countries in Africa with the highest spending power for luxury: Nigeria and South Africa. Those were the two deciding factors. This is the first of its kind, and with my vision, I want it to become an annual event.

As a Nigerian, why was Lagos the natural choice for hosting Africa’s first luxury-focused Jewellery, Watch, and Home trade experience?

Lagos is the hub. This is where everything happens. If I was going to do anything in Africa, it would be an injustice if I didn’t start here. There was just a real connection for me to start here, more than anything.

We’re happy to have you here! You mentioned that Nigeria and South Africa have the spending power for luxury. Africa has long influenced global luxury, yet hasn’t always been recognised. How does this Expo shift the narrative — from Africa as a consumer market to Africa as a centre of luxury creation?

Over the past decade, I’ve watched ART X grow into something truly remarkable. An exhibition that celebrates the luxury and beauty of African art, drawing visitors from around the world. The same can be said of Lagos Fashion Week, which now attracts audiences from across the globe. I believe this expo will follow that path — becoming a key destination where people come to discover luxury brands and connect with others in the industry.

More importantly, for me, there’s an undertone of promoting African luxury. There are individuals in Nigeria who are pushing the boundaries when it comes to fashion, jewellery, accessories, and anything within the luxury lifestyle range. The expo aims to highlight this and showcase those brands as well. It’s a double-edged sword, but for it to work, we have to attract people with the popular international brands they already know. We utilise this as a powerful tool to highlight indigenous entrepreneurs in the luxury sector, bringing them to the forefront and using the platform to showcase and elevate them on a global stage. That’s the idea and focus.

That is a good entry point. Many people look for opportunities at events like this. How will this platform create opportunities — from jobs to networks — for people working in fashion, jewellery, watchmaking, and design?

If you examine what Polo Luxury, Alara, RJ4, and Temple Muse are doing — bringing international brands into the African market, selling them, and creating jobs — this event will contribute to that. There are young people thinking about how to get into watchmaking and the luxury space, as well as how to learn about fashion and jewellery making. However, there is a certain level of craftsmanship that luxury requires. For those people, there’ll be a lot of knowledge around that will encourage them to do more. There will be a conference where C-suite executives of brands will share why Africa is such a big market for them. They will also discuss the opportunities, challenges, and wider issues facing the luxury sector. This will provide us with deep insights into their business and how they have grown it over many years to build it into an international brand. People will be able to learn from them.

It’s great to hear that there’ll be learning opportunities beyond the glamour. What impact do you see LAJWH Expo having on Nigeria’s economy and Africa’s luxury industry?

With what the likes of Polo luxury are doing, signing brands that they can sell locally, I’m bringing additional brands that perhaps no one has signed. Some entrepreneurs and investors would look at those brands and are interested in opening up a retail store to sell locally for this brand. Many individuals will have the opportunity to partner, collaborate, network, and build with various brands at the expo, while also growing their businesses virtually.

Furthermore, for this event alone, we estimate that over 100 people will be flying in. They’ll be contributing to the economy by booking hotels, travel expenses — food and entertainment. My vision is to see at least 1,000 to 3,000 people fly in for the event annually. Just as many already travel for Detty December, fashion, and art, I want them to come for a luxury experience as well. This will impact the Nigerian economy positively and also elevate Africa’s luxury industry.

Let’s get our audience buzzing. What makes LAJWH Expo different from other luxury showcases? What can guests expect to experience across the exhibitions and exclusive events?

The beauty of it is that it is a lifestyle event. We have Rolls-Royce coming in to showcase; tell us how to buy and customise a Rolls-Royce. They will show us the whole works; interiors, lighting, wheels, colour. Perfume brands from different parts of the world are coming in; it’ll be a sensory experience. We will also have jewellery from different brands showcasing the European quality of their products. Then we have watch brands: Backes & Strauss, Richard Mille and Franck Muller, with displays of time pieces. Attendees get a sense of a Harrods-like experience, as I mentioned earlier. For the first edition, we’ve concentrated on just about 10 to 12 brands. We’ll grow next year into something bigger.

We also have Access Bank showcasing, because with luxury, you need the right financial partner to facilitate those purchases. Additionally, we have workshops, and one of them will be handled by Bonhams Auction, an international auction house in London. They’ll be discussing African art — how to invest in it, the best pieces to consider, why it’s worth investing in, and the immense scale of the industry. This is an essential part because all over Europe, people are buying African art. We need to examine whether we are truly investing into our own arts or we are just importing and selling them, while somebody else is reaping the financial benefit.

We have Deborah Gispan of Panoba who will talk about education. Many Nigerians want to send their children to private schools abroad — Oxford, Cambridge, etc. We will learn the process, challenges and the best ways to navigate this migration. These are just some of the initiatives we’re bringing to the expo. There’ll be a lot of knowledge and information passed on. That’s very important to me.

This is exciting. For luxury, it’s more than products. It’s the experience and the culture of it. How does that philosophy come alive at the Expo, especially in the dialogue between African and international brands?

The word luxury is often used loosely, and certain historical factors come with saying you’re a luxury brand. African brands attending the Expo will learn from traditional international brands — how they’ve leveraged their name, built a legacy, maintained quality, retained customers, and expanded their brand globally. These are all learning tools, and there’s no school that teaches people about luxury in Nigeria. The best way to learn is from those who are excelling and whom people are choosing to buy from. That’s how you grow and master your craft.

An additional spin to it is that I want brands to come into Nigeria and see our luxury materials. Some of the leather created north is what brands like Hermes or Louis Vuitton use. We also have diamonds, gold and talented artisans. So, the international luxury brands attending this Expo will gain something valuable. They’ll learn about our beading, particularly leather, as well as the history and wealth of knowledge to do bespoke fashion in Nigeria. Bespoke in Europe is considered a luxury — having an outfit tailored to your body and style comes at a high cost. In Nigeria, anyone can visit a tailor for measurements and have bespoke pieces designed. What we see as ordinary here is regarded as luxury in Europe.

This is not one-way traffic. Both industries have a lot to learn. Those coming in want to study the market, the people and how we do things over here.

It’s a good opportunity for our brands to learn the luxury experience that makes the price point worth it. Looking ahead, do you plan to expand this vision across other African cities, like South Africa, as you’ve mentioned?

Absolutely! It’s a must for me to do that, but we’re starting with Nigeria first. This is our maiden edition; we want to see the response and the appetite for it, as well as what the brands will say at the end of it. It is a research tool to get all that information and knowledge. More than likely, before I even contemplate hosting in another country, I would have to do another edition in Nigeria, possibly in Abuja. After we’ve done that next year, I’ll be open to looking at other markets from there.

As the founder, what would success for this first edition look like to you?

If people turn up, that’s success. Everything else we can fix, but what I need is for people to turn up. I want to see attendees happy, excited and enthusiastic to actually learn. That, in my view, is success. I can build everything else from there.

If you could sum it up in one sentence, what statement does the Expo make to the world about Africa’s luxury renaissance?

Nigeria is here to stay in the luxury market. We are a powerhouse. We are a culture of hardworking, entrepreneurial individuals. If a brand exists anywhere in the world but isn’t in Nigeria, it’s not truly reaching its full potential.

LAJWH Expo: Redefining Nigeria’s luxury narrative

As our conversation drew to a close, it was clear that the passion behind the LAJWH Expo runs deeper than luxury alone. “This has been two years in the making,” Alexander Amosu admitted, reflecting on the challenges of bringing international brands to Lagos. “Convincing them to come wasn’t easy — many had fears about safety, their lives and products.”

That is exactly why this moment matters for Alexander Amosu. He sees the Expo as a chance to rewrite the narrative of Nigeria itself. “After this expo, I want the world to see that we had a successful luxury event here.” Instead, people will leave saying, ‘I stayed in one of the best hotels, I met incredible people, and what I thought Nigeria was is not what I saw with my own eyes.’”

It is a vision rooted in pride and possibility. “Those who attend will become ambassadors for Nigeria,” he said with quiet conviction. “They’ll tell the world that Lagos is not just alive, it is thriving — and it deserves its place at the center of global luxury.”

The LAJWH Expo is an opportunity to be part of Africa’s luxury renaissance and to see Lagos in all its brilliance. As Alexander Amosu and his team prepare to open the doors, one thing is certain: this is a moment you will not want to miss.

"Dangote Refinery’s CNG rollout to save N1.8tr yearly, cuts fuel price in Lagos, Abuja","The Dangote Petroleum Refinery is set to begin the rollout of compressed natural gas (CNG)-powered trucks on Monday, 15th September, as part of its logistics-free distribution programme aimed at significantly reducing fuel prices across Nigeria.

In a statement released by the company, this transition to CNG-powered transportation is expected to save the Nigerian economy over N1.8 trillion annually.

The move, according to the company, is designed to cut fuel distribution costs, reduce pump prices, and ease inflationary pressures. In particular, the initiative is expected to benefit more than “42 million micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs)” by lowering energy costs and improving profit margins.

Dangote Refinery noted that the initiative will see the gantry price reduced to N820 per litre, with corresponding lower pump prices in several key states. Lagos and other South-Western states will see fuel retailing at N841 per litre, while Abuja, Rivers, Delta, Edo, and Kwara states will sell at “N851 per litre.”

The first phase of the deployment will cover the Federal Capital Territory, Lagos, Kwara, Delta, Edo, Rivers, and South-West states, with nationwide expansion planned as additional trucks are delivered.

“Dangote Group is investing over N720 billion into the programme, which is also anticipated to revitalise dormant filling stations across the country. The project is expected to create numerous direct employment opportunities, including roles for truck drivers, filling station managers, and fuel attendants,” it stated.

The company has called on stakeholders, including fuel station operators, telecommunications companies, and large-scale fuel consumers, to partner with the initiative to ensure its success and maximise its economic impact.",https://guardian.ng/energy/dangote-refinerys-cng-rollout-to-save-n1-8tr-yearly-cuts-fuel-price-in-lagos-abuja/,https://guardian.ng
"NUPENG threatens strike resumption, says Dangote Refinery breached deal","The Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) has accused the management of Dangote Refinery of reneging on an agreement that guaranteed employees the right to unionise, warning that it may resume a nationwide strike barely two days after suspending its earlier action.

In a joint statement signed by NUPENG President Williams Akporeha and General Secretary Afolabi Olawale, the union said its Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD) members had been ordered to remove the union’s stickers from their trucks despite a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed earlier this week.

“We are by this statement placing all our members on red alert for the resumption of the suspended nationwide industrial action,” the statement read. “We call on the Nigeria Labour Congress, Trade Union Congress, civil society organisations, and global working people to rise in solidarity against this threat.”

The allegation comes after a closed-door meeting convened on September 8 by the Department of State Services (DSS), attended by Finance Minister Wale Edun, representatives of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), officials of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), and Dangote Group executives.

At that meeting, both parties signed an MoU affirming that unionisation is a right under Nigerian labour law. The document stipulated that employees of Dangote Refinery and Petrochemicals willing to unionise would be allowed to do so, that the process would begin immediately and be completed within two weeks (September 9–22), and that no worker would be victimised.

The MoU was signed by Sayyu Dantata for Dangote Group; O.K. Ukoha for NMDPRA; Benson Upah for NLC; N.A. Toro for the Trade Union Congress (TUC); Williams Akporeha and Afolabi Olawale for NUPENG; and Amos Falonipe, Director of Trade Union Services and Industrial Relations, on behalf of the Minister of Labour.

Despite this resolution, NUPENG said its members faced intimidation. “We call on the Federal Government not to allow the Navy and other security agents who are paid by the resources of this country to be used with impunity against the laws and people of this country,” the statement added.

Dangote Refinery had earlier dismissed allegations of anti-labour practices, describing them as “cheap blackmail.” Company spokesman Anthony Chiejina insisted that operations were continuing without fuel shortages.

The strike, launched by NUPENG-PTD on Monday, was initially triggered by claims that the refinery was hiring new drivers on the condition that they not join the union. Dangote management denied the claim.

The refinery, which began operations last year with a capacity of 650,000 barrels per day, was designed to reduce Nigeria’s reliance on imported petrol. While it has lowered pump prices and disrupted existing supply chains, the refinery’s dominance has raised monopoly concerns.

Dangote Group is also preparing to roll out thousands of compressed natural gas-powered trucks for petrol distribution, though the move has faced delays, creating tension with the existing fleet of more than 20,000 diesel-powered tanker operators.

The Federal Ministry of Labour said it will issue a formal statement on the latest developments.",https://guardian.ng/energy/nupeng-threatens-strike-resumption-says-dangote-refinery-breached-deal/,https://guardian.ng

"Akwa Ibom, REA sign MOU to boost rural electrification projects","Akwa Ibom State Governor, Pastor Umo Eno, has affirmed that electricity is central to the state’s development agenda, declaring that the era of energy insecurity in Akwa Ibom is over.

The announcement came during a strategic roundtable with the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) on Wednesday, September 10, 2025, where the state government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the agency to advance renewable energy and rural electrification initiatives.

Governor Eno said the state is shifting from policy formulation to the practical implementation of electricity solutions to transform lives and power industries. “We have moved from aspiration to legal and institutional foundation. Today, we pivot to implementation and delivery,” he said.

Over the past year, Akwa Ibom has delivered the State Electricity Policy (2024), enacted the Electricity Law (2025), and established regulatory frameworks for implementation, providing a legal and institutional foundation for energy projects. Eno emphasized that electricity underpins his administration’s economic blueprint, the ARISE Agenda, which prioritizes agriculture, industry, education, healthcare, digital hubs, women-led enterprises, and job creation.

The Governor assured investors that the state will provide land, expedite permits, ensure regulatory clarity, and facilitate financing to ensure project success. “Electricity is the key driver of our purpose to ensure that every Akwa Ibomite, in every corner of this State, can live with dignity and opportunity in the 21st century,” he said, urging RESCOs and private sector participants to move from planning to project execution within 15 to 18 months.

Eno also highlighted the state’s plans to leverage natural gas and small hydro resources while incorporating renewable energy solutions to achieve a sustainable energy transition.

Deputy Governor, Dr. Akon Eyakenyi, described the roundtable as a “critical milestone” in achieving universal electricity access, emphasizing the role of off-grid deployment in reaching unserved and underserved communities.

REA Managing Director, Aliyu Baba, commended the governor’s commitment to rural development, noting that the ARISE Agenda aligns with the national electrification program. Baba said REA will continue to collaborate with states to attract private investment and provide affordable electricity for rural populations.

Commissioner for Power, Rt. Hon. Iniobong Robson Etebe, presented on renewable energy opportunities in the state, identifying prospects in solar, hydro, and gas-to-power projects. He said the government has created a conducive environment to ensure projects are viable and sustainable.

The roundtable also included a demonstration of the REA Community Mapping Tool by the Technical Adviser of the Nigerian Electrification Program (NEP) and the formal signing of the MoU to strengthen collaboration between Akwa Ibom State and REA.

Governor Eno was joined by Deputy Governor Eyakenyi; Secretary to the State Government, Prince Enobong Uwah; Chief Delivery Advisor, Mr. Aniefiok Johnson; the Attorney General; the Commissioners for Power, Finance, Information, and Local Government; and the Special Adviser on Rural Development and Cooperatives.",https://guardian.ng/energy/akwa-ibom-rea-sign-mou-to-boost-rural-electrification-projects/,https://guardian.ng
Mele Kyari reports to EFCC over investigation at NNPCL,"The immediate past Group Managing Director (GMD) of Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL), Mele Kyari, has honored the invitation of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) following an ongoing investigation.

A top source within the EFCC, who spoke with The Guardian, pleaded anonymity as he was not authorized to speak, and disclosed this on Wednesday.

The source confirmed that Kyari was invited, and he is currently in the custody of the anti-graft agency.

The development comes days after the Federal High Court in Abuja ordered the temporary freezing of four Jaiz Bank accounts linked to Mele Kyari, the immediate past Group Managing Director (GMD) of NNPCL, over allegations of fraud.

Justice Emeka Nwite made the order after the EFCC’s lawyer, Ogechi Ujam, moved an ex parte motion to that effect.

This development follows the Senate Committee on Public Accounts, chaired by Aliyu Wadada, raising the alarm about alleged discrepancies involving trillions of naira in the audited financial statements of NNPCL.

The Committee described the revelations as mind-boggling and worrisome, emphasizing that the concerns stem from its analysis of NNPCL’s audited financial statements from 2017 to 2023.

The committee immediately handed over a list of 11 queries to the NNPCL finance team with a one-week deadline for response.

The development comes months after President Bola Tinubu approved the reconstitution of the NNPCL board, removing the chairman, Chief Pius Akinyelure, and the Group Chief Executive Officer, Mele Kyari.

National grid collapse throws Nigeria into darkness as capacity crashes to 120MW,"A general view of a power distribution plant which has ran out of power supply following a collapse of the national grid resulting in total blackout in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital, on March 15, 2022. From Nigerian airlines to Malawi bakers, African countries are feeling the pain of Ukraine's crisis as supply disruptions hike inflation and oil prices push up fuel costs. Global oil prices touched ten-year highs of more than $100 a barrel soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, doubling diesel prices for African countries like Nigeria.

Nigeria’s fragile power sector suffered another major setback on Wednesday as the national electricity grid collapsed, leaving most parts of the country in blackout.

The grid, known for frequent collapse crashed from 4,500 megawatts to 120MW.

The Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) confirmed the outage in a public notice, citing a total loss of supply from the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) at 11:23 a.m.

“Please be informed that the power outage currently being experienced is due to a loss of supply from the national grid… affecting electricity supply across our franchise areas,” AEDC stated.

The utility assured customers that efforts were underway with relevant stakeholders to restore supply once the grid stabilises.

Real-time data from the National System Operator (NSO) seen at 1:10 p.m. showed that only 120 megawatts (MW) were available on the grid — a fraction of Nigeria’s installed capacity of over 12,000 MW and far below the 4,000–5,000 MW typically distributed on a normal day.

The limited power was shared among just four distribution companies (DisCos). Ibadan Disco currently has about 50 MW, followed by Enugu Disco with 40 MW. Abuja Disco, at the time of writing this report has 20 MW, while Benin Disco has 10 MW.

The remaining seven DisCos, including Ikeja, Eko, Kano, Kaduna, Jos, Port Harcourt and Yola, were left with zero allocation, meaning no power supply to their franchise areas.

"Nigeria targets $60bn investment to boost gas output, infrastructure","The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited has announced plans to raise $60 billion in new investments over the next five to seven years to expand gas production and develop infrastructure aimed at strengthening the country’s role in the global energy market.

Group Chief Executive Officer of NNPC Limited, Bayo Ojulari, outlined the target on Tuesday during the Energy Talk segment of the 2025 Gastech Exhibition and Conference in Milan, Italy.

The announcement was contained in a statement released by NNPC’s Chief Corporate Communications Officer, Andy Odeh.

Ojulari said Nigeria intends to scale up daily gas production to 12 billion cubic feet while increasing refining capacity to meet rising global demand. He added that the Federal Government had improved conditions for foreign capital.

“President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has improved Nigeria’s investment climate and positioned the country as the preferred investment destination for the energy sector in Africa,” he said.

According to Ojulari, several gas-based projects, including petrochemical and methanol plants, have already attracted investors, but additional capital is required.

“We require additional investments to build infrastructure to support the Federal Government’s aspiration to power the nation’s transportation sector with Compressed Natural Gas (CNG),” he stated.

He also pointed to untapped reserves in crude oil. “Apart from gas, our existing crude oil assets have huge untapped reservoirs for investors to tap into to boost production beyond the current 1.7 million barrels per day. We also have over 200 undeveloped oil fields with enormous potential,” he said.

Ojulari highlighted ongoing projects, including the Ajaokuta–Kaduna–Kano (AKK) gas pipeline and NLNG Train 7, as central to Nigeria’s energy transition strategy, which focuses on gas and Liquefied Petroleum Gas.

He also noted NNPC’s commitments to carbon capture initiatives, energy efficiency technologies, and reduced gas flaring.

“Our focus is on eradicating energy poverty, which requires enormous investments in gas as the fuel of choice for industrialisation and LPG as domestic cooking gas for the over six million Africans who lack access to clean energy,” Ojulari said.

The Gastech conference, which drew more than 50,000 participants and 1,000 exhibitors from 150 countries, provided a platform for Nigeria to present its case to potential investors.",https://guardian.ng/featured/nigeria-targets-60bn-investment-to-boost-gas-output-infrastructure/,https://guardian.ng
Gastech: NNPCL woos investors to tap into Nigeria’s Energy Sector,"The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) has called on international investors to direct their attention to Nigeria and tap into the huge opportunities in the country’s energy sector.

According to a statement signed by Chief Corporate Communications Officer of NNPCL, Andy Odeh, Group Chief Executive Officer, Engineer Bayo Ojulari, made the call while fielding questions from Hala Gorani of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) during the Energy Talk segment of the 2025 Gastech Exhibition & Conference, currently taking place in Milan, Italy.

Ojulari commended President Bola Tinubu for improving Nigeria’s investment climate and positioning the country as the preferred investment destination for the energy sector in Africa.

The GCEO also stressed that the new NNPCL management is keen on attaining its set targets towards delivering value to its shareholders.

According to him, while a number of investors were already coming into the country with gas-based industries such as petrochemicals and methanol plants, more investments were required to build infrastructure to support the Federal Government’s aspiration to power the nation’s transportation sector with Compressed Natural Gas (CNG).

Ojulari further explained that apart from gas, the existing crude oil assets have huge untapped reservoirs for investors to tap into, towards boosting production from the current 1.7 million barrels per day, besides over 200 oil fields that are currently undeveloped.

On measures being taken to make Nigeria an investors’ haven, the GCEO said NNPCL was investing heavily in carbon capture projects, as well as technology to enhance energy efficiency and reduce gas flaring in compliance with the objectives of financing partners.

“He said that a number of critical gas infrastructure projects in the country, such as the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) Gas pipeline, are in their advanced stages, while the NLNG Train 7 Project is also being progressed,” Odeh stated.

“Ojulari noted that Nigeria’s energy transition strategy is focused on eradicating energy poverty, which requires enormous investments in gas as the fuel of choice for industrialisation, as well as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) as domestic cooking gas for the over six million Africans who lack access to clean energy.”

Oyo bans ‘sign-out’ celebrations in schools,"The Oyo State Government has officially banned ‘sign-out’ celebrations by final-year students in both public and private schools across the state.

This directive came in response to increasing reports of misconduct, violence, and public disturbances associated with such events.

The announcement was made by the Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Hon. Olusegun Olayiwola, during the 2025/2026 pre-resumption meeting with public secondary schools principals held at Lagelu Grammar School, Ibadan.

Olayiwola also reiterated the enforcement of the existing ban on mobile phone usage by students in schools, emphasising that such devices pose significant distractions, facilitate access to non-educational content, and can contribute to cyberbullying and misconduct.

The commissioner commended principals for their dedication to shaping young minds and maintaining educational standards in the State. He stressed that no student should face financial barriers in pursuit of education, and principals must avoid unauthorised levies or illegal fees to ensure education remains accessible.

Olayiwola further highlighted the importance of staff punctuality and active engagement in teaching, while underscoring the need to maintain student safety and security. Schools must remain free of violence, bullying, and intimidation to protect adolescents during their formative years.

In addition, principals were directed to recommend only government-approved textbooks, which had been selected for their quality, reusability, and alignment with the curriculum. It was emphasised that the Ministry of Education would closely monitor compliance with these directives.

Earlier, in her goodwill message, the Chairman of the Teaching Service Commission, Mrs. Olubukola Oladipupo, urged principals and teachers to seek clarification before writing petitions and emphasised her openness to constructive dialogue for the improvement of education in the State.

The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Mrs. Bamidele Oyinloye, in her welcome address, reiterated the importance of diligence and adherence to rules and regulations in school management.

Representatives of key education bodies, including the Oyo State President of All Nigeria Confederation of Principals of Secondary Schools (ANCOPSS), Comrade Akinoye Christopher, and the Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT) State Chairman, Comrade Raji Oladimeji, praised Governor Engr.

Led by the Executive Chairman of the Kwara State Universal Basic Education Board (KWSUBEB), Prof. Shehu Raheem Adaramaja, the programme is part of sustained efforts to promote quality education and alleviate the financial burden on parents.

Adaramaja stated that the event marked the fifth edition of the Summer Lessons programme, underscoring his commitment to supporting basic education in Kwara State through interventions like school rehabilitation, teacher training, and aid to indigent pupils.

He commended Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq for fostering a conducive environment to drive educational initiatives, stating that the scholarships and support stand as examples of collaborative efforts between leaders and communities aimed at empowering children through education, seen as a vital path to broader empowerment and community development.

He said, “In a society where many children risk being left behind due to economic challenges, the foundation stands as a reminder that targeted, community-driven interventions can change destinies. Year after year, it demonstrates that education is not merely a classroom experience, but a shared responsibility — one that requires the combined will of government, leaders, and communities.”",https://guardian.ng/features/education/foundation-supports-kwara-students-with-scholarships-exam-fee-payments/,https://guardian.ng
"‘Schools with unqualified teachers to lose WAEC, NECO accreditation’","In another bold move to reform the educational system nationwide, the Federal Government has insisted that secondary school teachers must obtain the proper certification; otherwise, their schools won’t be allowed to serve as examination centres.

In a policy directive issued, yesterday, and addressed to the Registrar/Chief Executive Officer of the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN), Minister of Education, Dr Tunji Alausa, disclosed that “the Federal Ministry of Education has directed that to strengthen professionalism in the teaching profession, the accreditation of both public and private secondary schools for the conduct of public examinations, such as WASSCE, NABTEB, NECO, & NBIAS, shall henceforth be contingent on the TRCN certification of teachers engaged in such schools.”

The directive further stated: “Accordingly, effective from March 2027 for WASSCE, May 2027 for NABTEB, June 2027 for NECO & June 2027 for SAISSCE, any school whose teachers are not duly registered and licensed with the TRCN shall be disqualified from serving as an examination centre.”

Alausa also indicated in the memo, that “state governments are therefore requested to take due cognisance of the directive and put in place necessary measures to ensure that all teachers in state-owned secondary schools and private secondary schools obtain the requisite TRCN certification within the stipulated two years from the date of this policy directive.”

The memo also indicated that “compliance with this directive shall be monitored, with schools expected to achieve a minimum compliance rate of 75 per cent by 2026 and full compliance of 100 per cent by 2027.”

It, however, stated that to afford the ease of compliance, “teachers who are non-education graduates but possess not less than 12 months of classroom teaching experience are encouraged to enrol in the abridged professional certification programme offered through the National Teachers Institute (NTI).”

The policy directive concluded that the matter should be given “the highest priority and ensure wide sensitisation of stakeholders across the country.”",https://guardian.ng/features/education/schools-with-unqualified-teachers-to-lose-waec-neco-accreditation/,https://guardian.ng
UNIMED advocates tech-driven innovation for Nigeria’s healthcare,"The University of Medical Sciences (UNIMED), Ondo State, has advocated for the deployment of technology and innovation to transform and revolutionise the Nigerian healthcare landscape as well.

While speaking at the opening of the second Faculty of Clinical Sciences Conference of the institution, a US-trained, double-board-certified diagnostic and vascular/interventional radiologist and founder of IRDOCNIGERIA, Dr Hammed Ninalowo, revealed how his team has successfully provided advanced interventional radiology care to patients across Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa.

With the conference bringing together leading medical experts, policymakers, and academics at the institution’s Oladipo Akinkugbe Hall on its Laje Campus, Ninalowo, who delivered the keynote address, spoke on the theme ‘Transforming Medical Care in Nigeria through Technology and Innovation’.

According to him, technology transfer and intensive upskilling have enabled his team to achieve numerous medical firsts while deliberately localising global expertise. He added that by training and utilising a local team to perform complex operations, capital flight can be limited, keeping expertise and revenue within the country.

He said: “In the last 24 months, we have treated 29 ions in about 27 patients. 23 out of the 27 of these patients are fully recovered. If you look at the local surgical data, where the mortality rate is about 47 per cent, we are doing much better now.”

The Vice-Chancellor of UNIMED, Prof. Ebunoluwa Adejuyigbe, who emphasised the need for inclusive leadership, stated that “diversity, equity and inclusion must not be afterthoughts. They must be embedded into the very foundation of our healthcare transformation.”

The Professor of Paediatrics and Child Health added that although the challenges faced by our healthcare are real, she encouraged that every challenge is also an invitation to innovate.

Adejuyigbe advocated collaboration among all the stakeholders in the health sector: “By fostering collaboration among clinicians, researchers, technologists, and policymakers, we can craft solutions that are not only effective but also sustainable and scalable.”

The Dean of the Faculty of Clinical Sciences, Prof. Oluseyi Adejumo, explained why UNIMED, as the premier university of medical sciences, is taking the lead in deploying technology and innovation to enhance medical care in Nigeria.

He said, “This gathering is coming at a time when the world is rapidly progressing in technological interventions and artificial intelligence. The healthcare space is not left out, and it has become clearer than ever that technology has numerous and vital roles to play in the practice of medicine in this current age.

“We must therefore leverage these potentials and innovations to improve our healthcare delivery system if we do not want to be left behind.”",https://guardian.ng/features/health/unimed-advocates-tech-driven-innovation-for-nigerias-healthcare/,https://guardian.ng
Rep says telehealth can save Nigeria $10b yearly,"A member of the House of Representatives, David Idris Zakarias, has urged Nigerians to embrace telehealth practices as a cost-saving alternative capable of halting the estimated $10 billion annual manpower waste in the health sector.

Zakarias, who represents Idah, Ibaji, Igalamela-Ofu Federal Constituency, made the call on Friday at a health event in Abuja.

He noted that Nigerians spend heavily on travel and logistics just to access medical personnel and facilities physically.

However, with the adoption of telehealth practices, he said most Nigerians would not need to visit medical centres except in rare health emergencies.

He said: “This initiative is very important, a very good idea to develop. I think it is one of the key points that we should welcome. We must be honest with ourselves.

“This is the first of its kind. We have been hearing, but it has drawn near to us. Sitting down in your home to get a treatment is one of the things that we have not seen before, and we have started feeling it now.

“Talking about the rural area, yes, technology has also spread across the globe, wherever you are now. As far as you can, you have what they call a phone to receive a call. So that is the only channel you can use.

“So getting a treatment from these people is very simple as long as you are receiving calls. And I can testify, I do not know about other areas, but the constituency I represent, there is no one left over, there is no place you cannot find network.

“As far as there is network, I believe you get the attention of these people and you get their service effectively.”

The Founder and Lead Person, Home Health Management Services Limited, Sam Adejoh Okedi, estimated that Nigeria loses about $10 billion to manpower.

Okedi said the vision of the organisation is to promote telehealth practice to ease medical care.

He said, “I will tell you that it is possible to save up to 10 billion dollars annually. Our vision is to have a continental footprint and that is the beauty of telemedicine and telehealth. We can be here, have a consultation with people in Ghana, in North Africa, South Africa or Eastern Africa.

“It is an upcoming and growing system, part of medicine and one good thing about this is to save costs, your travel costs.

“Because if you are leaving your house to go to the hospital, you are either buying fuel or you are taking a taxi, and you know anytime you leave your house you are also taking risks. You could have an accident.”",https://guardian.ng/features/health/rep-says-telehealth-can-save-nigeria-10b-yearly/,https://guardian.ng
"Pharmacy academy honours late Ifeanyi Atueyi, praises decades of impact","Director of Programme, Lolu Ojo; President, Lere Baale; wife of the late Ifeanyi Atueyi, Joan Atueyi; Founder and Pioneer President, Julius Adelusi-Adeluyi; and Vice President, Ahmed Yakasai, during the valedictory session organised by the Nigeria Academy of Pharmacy in Lagos.

The Nigeria Academy of Pharmacy (NAPharm) has honoured its pioneer vice president and founder of Pharmanews, Ifeanyi Atueyi, at a valedictory session in Lagos.

Atueyi died in July 2025 at the age of 85. He is survived by his wife, Joan Atueyi, children and grandchildren.

The event drew pharmacists, industry leaders and family members who described him as a man of integrity, vision and excellence whose work shaped pharmaceutical journalism in Nigeria.

The President of the academy, Prof. Lere Baale, described Atueyi as a visionary whose values and dedication left a lasting mark on the profession.

Baale said, “We have not just celebrated Ifeanyi Atueyi, we have also celebrated his wife. The academy believes in the family system. We also believe that when you honour those who have done well, it encourages more members to give their best with passion and talent.

“He was a gifted person and he used his gift in a passionate way to make things happen.”

The Pharmacy Council of Nigeria (PCN) described his passing as a monumental loss to the profession and the country.

In a tribute signed by its Registrar and Chief Executive Officer, Ibrahim Babashehu Ahmed, the council called him “more than just a pharmacist; he was a visionary, a trailblazer, and a relentless advocate for the advancement of our profession and healthcare.”

The council also recalled his generosity, especially his decision to give it a free column in Pharmanews to address regulatory issues, a gesture it said kept pharmacists across the country informed and engaged.

“We know that his presence, guidance and impactful contributions will be greatly missed,” the statement read. “But his legacy will make us better and help us fulfil our God-given purpose.”

Former Minister of Health and past president of the academy, Julius Adelusi-Adeluyi, described Atueyi as a humble and sincere professional who inspired others through his integrity.

“Ifeanyi Atueyi aspired to inspire others before he expired, and he succeeded,” Adelusi-Adeluyi said.

The Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN) also described Atueyi as a devoted pharmacist, media giant and visionary who recognised early the importance of communication in shaping healthcare delivery and professional identity.

Its President, Ayuba Tanko Ibrahim, said, “As a cherished media partner of the PSN, Sir Atueyi worked closely with successive leaderships of the society, most recently under my stewardship.

“His partnership was not limited to reporting activities. He was an active collaborator, offering strategic insight, historical perspective and moral guidance that enriched the vision and mission of our society.”

The Executive Director of Pharmanews, Dozie Ifeanyi Atueyi, described his father as a man driven by purpose who bridged the gap between science and pharmaceutical practice through journalism.

“I would describe my father, first of all, as a good man. He was a man of character, a man of integrity. He was a man of purpose. He did what he believed he was born to do. He believed God brought him into this world to make a difference in the healthcare sector, especially through Pharmanews,” Dozie said.

He added that the session was heartwarming as it reunited people who played pivotal roles in his father’s career and life.",https://guardian.ng/features/health/pharmacy-academy-honours-late-ifeanyi-atueyi-praises-decades-of-impact/,https://guardian.ng
Lagos government bans training of auxiliary nurses in hospitals,"• Reveals 32 hospitals shut between January and June 2025

• Doctors begin five-day warning strike nationwide today

Lagos State Government has said that it is illegal for any health facility to train auxiliary nurses, as well as for anyone to practise as an auxiliary nurse in the state.



It, however, threatened that any hospital that trains auxiliary nurses or has auxiliary nurses in its employment would be shut down. Permanent Secretary, Health Facility Monitoring and Accreditation Agency (HEFAMAA), Dr Abiola Idowu, gave the warning yesterday, during a sensitisation campaign cum town hall meeting in Alimosho Local Council on the roles and responsibilities of the HEFAMAA.



Idowu, who was represented by Director, Research and Statistics of HEFAMAA, Dr Olorunfemi Olonire, said that the state government had banned the training and practice by auxiliary nurses as they do more harm than good to the state’s health sector.



She, therefore, implored residents to report illegal and unapproved health facilities and quack medic practitioners to the agency for necessary actions.

According to her, the state government does not want the healthcare process of the citizens to be misdiagnosed or attended to unprofessionally, which is the reason the agency was set up.

Idowu revealed that 32 health facilities were shut between January and June for various infractions, stating that the agency is committed to ensuring that only approved health facilities operate in the state.



She said the agency has teams that monitor and inspect healthcare facilities spread across different local councils and local council development areas in the state.



The King of Shasha Kingdom, Oba Babatunde Nasiru, however, implored HEFAMAA to work on the nonchalant attitude of the staff of public hospitals to patients. He also urged the agency to step up its monitoring of public facilities and get the government to equip and staff them appropriately.

IN another development, the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) has declared a five-day warning strike, starting from today, September 12, 2025, to press home their demands.



This was confirmed in a statement yesterday by the General Secretary, Association of Resident Doctors, Federal Capital Territory Administration, Agbor Affiong.



The decision to embark on the strike was reached after the NARD online National Executive Council meeting on Wednesday, which extended to the early hours of yesterday, September 11, 2025.



“Arising from the NARD E-NEC meeting held on Wednesday, September 10, 2025, which extended into the early hours of Thursday, September 11, 2025, the NEC members unanimously resolved to embark on a five-day warning strike.



“The strike will commence at 8:00 a.m. on Friday, September 12, 2025, and will end on Tuesday, September 16, 2025.



“All centres are hereby directed to duly inform their hospital managements and continue to press home our collective demands,” the statement read.",https://guardian.ng/news/lagos-government-bans-training-of-auxiliary-nurses-in-hospitals/,https://guardian.ng
Crowd as Hilda Baci begins world’s biggest pot of jollof attempt,"Food influencer and Guinness World Records holder Hilda Baci began her attempt to cook the world’s largest pot of Nigerian jollof rice on Friday at Eko Hotels and Suites in Lagos.

Can Adekunle Gold carry Fuji’s flame to world stages?,"Once upon a time, Fuji music was once the soundtrack of Nigeria’s hottest dancefloors. The percussive-leaning genre, bristling with a meld of indigenous instruments like the Agogo, sekere, and bembe, among others, was created by Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister circa the mid 50s.

Barrister, who emerged from popular Were (pronounced Way-ray) music traditions of Isale Eko, Mushin and Oyingbo, popularized the genre after he began inflecting Quranic recitations in his lyrics and use of the harmonica.

While Were music was strictly performed only during the month of Ramadan, Barrister knew he had to distinguish his style to allow him perform it outside of Ramadan. And on one fateful day, he saw an advertorial for a tour to the Japanese Mount Fuji and he decided to christen his style of music as Fuji. He soon became a household voice across South-Western Nigeria, birthing a movement that has survived several generations and evolutions till date.

Fuji music itself evolved from Barrister’s special touch during the 70’s and 80’s, becoming increasingly popular with the rise of emerging talent like Fatai Adio, Waidi Akangbe, Iyanda Sawaba, Rahimi Ayinde, Love Azeez, Agbada Owo and Alhaji Ayinla Kollington who carried the torch with their various interpretations of the genre.

From the mid 80s till the early 2000s, Fuji music found more acceptance within mainstream Nigerian musicdom, introducing acts like Wasiu Ayinde, Adewale Ayuba, Wasiu Alabi Pasuma, Saheed Osupa, Muri Thunder, Remi Aluko, Sir Shina Akanni, Alhaji Isiaka Iyanda Sawaba, Alayeluwa Sulaimon, Sule Adio (aka Atawewe), Taye Currency, and several others.

Within five decades, Fuji music became the pulse of Yoruba partying culture, with Hip Hop interpolations and radical stylized interpretations. However, with the rise of several other music traditions like Konto, Galala, Swo, Naija pop, Naija Rap, and several others, the genre quieted down with only a few adherents still raising its flag across the world.

The AG Baby Rebirth

When Nigerian music icon 9ice dropped his sophomore album Gongo Aso in 2008, it was a defining moment for Afrobeats. Although Fuji and Hip Hop were the cornerstones of his hit records, Fuji music barely scratched the surface of public consciousness. It still lingered as a minority sound, enjoyed mostly in local suburbs across South-Western Nigeria.

The same thing happened recently with the Grammy-nominated superstar Asake, whose vibrant fusion of Fuji music, Hip Hop, and Afrobeats have caught global attention since 2022 till date. Although his fame soared, Fuji Music didn’t enjoy the same attention.

Two days ago, award-winning star Adekunle Gold announced October 3rd as the release date for his sixth album which he ceremoniously titled Fuji. While his discography holds a tangible presence of the influence of Yoruba indigenous music, nothing could have prepared listeners for a Fuji-tributing Adekunle Gold album. Not even the obvious presence of the genre in his last two singles, “Coco Money” and “Bobo (with Lojay and Shoday)” hinted at a Fuji-themed album.

His bold decision to call his album Fuji makes one curious as to his chances of giving the Yoruba cultural heritage its long-awaited moment in the mainstream.

The short answer is Yes. But the long answer is that it would require the same intentionality that birthed the genre itself. Fuji music itself is a raspy dance groove, an approach AG Baby has executed seamlessly with his discography especially on songs like “Party No Dey Stop”, “High”, “Ogaranya”, among others. One would expect a powerful fusion of Fuji’s instrumentation with modern influences, including electronic dance music, pop and, perhaps, Hip Hop. Fuji music, with an average tempo of 135 beats per minute requires high octane energy to unlock that savoury delivery that keeps it addictive on dancefloors. Adekunle Gold’s interpolations have to brim with a tempered cadence that retains his soft-heavy vocal signature and Fuji’s overwhelming gusto.

Another important element that must be present in Adekunle Gold’s album is his infusion of personality within his thematic direction. For a Fuji album to properly resonate to local and even global audiences, it must soar with a touch of originality in the storytelling. And Adekunle Gold’s prowess at turning his personal life stories into ageless anthems as he did on songs like “Pick Up” and “Orente” would need to be heavily present across this album to achieve the profound catharsis that it needs to spread beyond borders. It’s similar to how Magic System’s 2000s hit, “Premier Gaou” struck like a meteor, with stories so real that they connect deeply with the listener irrespective of language barriers.

Another important facet of AG Baby’s attempt at exporting Fuji music at this time is the inclusion of global collaborations. It’s key to attracting international press, festival tours, and social media virality. With confirmed global collaborations such as Pharrel Williams, Swae Lee, 79th Element, the musician is poised to ascend into American and European musicdom. Another iconic collaboration on the album is Fuji music veteran Kwam 1 The Ultimate, who popularized his ‘Talazo Fuji’ style in the early 80s. These collaborations indicate a neat dose of vintage Fuji nostalgia with futuristic Fuji fusions. The album has to ring as a Fuji record, not just in title, but in sound and spirit.

Fuji music also extends beyond its sonics; it’s a culture that includes classic Yoruba fashion interpreted with contemporary luxury, opulent lifestyle, colourful live performances, and street carnivals. A Fuji album from an artist of Adekunle Gold’s stature must bring mainstream cultural elements to the culture of Fuji music to make the genre relevant to newcomer generations.

Only time would tell whether Adekunle Gold’s attempt would bear fruit, as he gears to release the album October 3. Nonetheless, if there’s anyone with a strong chance of navigating the road less travelled and resuscitating the genre’s appeal on a global scale, it is Adekunle Gold",https://guardian.ng/life/music/can-adekunle-gold-carry-fujis-flame-to-world-stages/,https://guardian.ng
Ed Sheeran to release eighth studio album,"British popstar Ed Sheeran, who recently revealed an upcoming United States tour, will release his latest album “Play” on Friday.

“Play” is the 34-year-old singer-songwriter’s eighth studio album and follows more than a decade of stunning global success and smash hits like “Shape of You” and “Perfect”.

He released his last album, “Autumn Variations”, in 2023.

Known for blending pop, folk and other musical genres with his own distinct acoustic style, Sheeran is the sixth most-streamed artist on Spotify and his 2017 song “Shape of You” is among the most listened-to tracks in the world.

Sheeran said he made his latest album “as a direct response to the darkest period of my life” and that he wanted to “create joy and technicolour”.

It was recorded “all over the world” before wrapping up in the coastal state of Goa in India.

Speaking on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon earlier this year, the singer revealed that his next four albums would be called “Pause”, “Rewind”, “Fast-Forward” and “Stop”.

They follow his mathematically themed albums “Plus”, “Multiply”, “Divide”, “Subtract” and “Equals”.

Sheeran, who grew up in eastern England, said earlier this week that he is set to move to the United States with his family due to an upcoming tour there, without specifying the dates.

After a flurry of headlines that he was permanently leaving the UK, he then clarifed in an Instagram post that it was a temporary relocation.

“I’m not moving, I’m going on tour with my family and relocating to the continent I’m touring on, don’t wanna commute from London to San Diego obvz,” he posted.

Sheeran also insisted “this isn’t a tax thing”, adding he would “always pay tax in UK”.

Five things to know about Malawi,"Malawi, a poor southern African country mired in a deep economic crisis, holds presidential and legislative elections on September 16.

Here are five things to know about the small country home to around 21 million people.

– Dire poverty –

It is one of the world’s poorest countries. According to the World Bank, 71 percent of its people lived on less than the poverty threshold of $2.15 per day in 2024. This is expected to increase given Malawi’s economic problems and growing food insecurity.

“Despite significant progress in reducing child mortality and fertility rates, hunger remains a critical concern due to successive weak harvests since 2022,” the World Bank says on its website.

This kept the rate of stunted children under five at 38 percent since 2015.

– Three decades of dictatorship –

Formerly called Nyasaland, Malawi gained independence from Britain in 1964. Its first president was a dictator, Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who held power for three decades and was ousted in the first multi-party elections in 1994.

Vice President Joyce Banda, no relation, in 2012 became Malawi’s first woman leader — and only the second on the continent at the time — on the death of then-president Bingu wa Mutharika.

She left the country in 2014 under a cloud, having lost the presidential election and facing questioning over the “Cashgate” corruption scandal.

Banda returned four years later and is among the 17 presidential candidates, alongside the outgoing leader Lazarus Chakwera and his predecessor, Peter Mutharika.

– Extreme weather –

Malawi’s economy is dependent on rain-fed agriculture, much of it subsistence or smallholding farming, making it vulnerable to climate risks.

In 2024 the country suffered severe drought and in 2023 it was hit by Cyclone Freddy, which left more than 1,200 people dead or missing.

The disasters contributed to an economic crisis that sparked demonstrations in early 2025, with year-on-year inflation rate passing 27 percent in July.

– Tobacco, tea, tourism –

Its biggest export is tobacco, which made up 57.5 percent of the total in 2024, according to national statistics.

After tobacco and tea, tourism is its third-largest source of foreign currency. To boost the sector, Malawi this year lifted visa requirements for 79 countries, including Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.

Lake Malawi, Africa’s third-largest freshwater lake, runs the length of the country and was listed a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984.

The UN culture agency this year also listed a mountain range dominated by Mount Mulanje, considered a sacred place inhabited by gods, spirits and ancestors.

The recent discovery of widely sought-after rare earth minerals is tipped to have the potential to change the country’s fortunes.

– Nonagenarian music legend –

After a seven-decade music career, Giddes Chalamanda gained global acclaim when he teamed up with young gospel artist Patience Namadingo in 2020 to record a reggae remix titled “Linny Hoo”.

The hit racked up more than 6.9 million views on YouTube and over 80 million views on TikTok in late 2021, and spawned mashups and remixes around the world.

Okhueleigbe, a women’s and youth advocate, is also a holder of two Master’s Degrees, one of which is in Gender Studies.

A lover of education and believer in human capital development and capacity building, the Doctorate Degree achievement is one of the several ambitious targets she set for herself before clocking 35.

She has since continued to attract accolades for the uncommon feat.

An award-winning Nigerian Tax Auditor with the FIRS, humanitarian, and civic leader, Okhueleigbe, recently delivered a keynote address at the African Women Achievers Awards and Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, where she encouraged Africans to be united.

At the event, she charged students to turn negativity around them into a positive outcome and define their lives as they want and refuse to be influenced negatively.

Okhueleigbe, also the founder of P.S.L, is a firm believer that people can cause positive changes around them through hard work, commitment and a positive mindset.

With a career that bridges tax auditing, technology, public service, and civic leadership, and also with advanced certifications from Harvard Business School and the London School of Business Administration, Okhueleigbe is reputed to have turned passion into purpose and purpose into real, measurable change.",https://guardian.ng/guardian-woman/accolades-as-okhueleigbe-bags-doctorate-degree-at-30/,https://guardian.ng
Where are the women in Nigeria’s Legislature?,"The struggles of women in Nigeria’s legislature are well-documented. Today, in the Senate, only four voices out of 109 are female. Across the 469-member National Assembly, they occupy fewer than 5 percent of seats.

The recent example of Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan, one of those four, laid bare how precarious women’s foothold in the legislature remains. She was suspended from the Senate for six months – roughly 180 sitting days – over alleged misconduct and violation of Senate Standing Rules.

That move sparked mixed reactions. But beyond her individual case, it reflects a broader concern: the barriers women face in even getting into Nigeria’s legislature, let alone holding their ground once inside. This imbalance is not just a statistic; it is stark underrepresentation. And it raises a critical question: how can legislation truly reflect the population when women are barely represented at the decision-making table?

Despite their small numbers, women legislators are far from passive. As of May, Senator Ipalibo Banigo had sponsored 13 bills, Senator Idiat Oluranti Adebule 7 bills, Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan 4 bills, and Senator Ireti Kingibe 1 bill – and that’s only counting the bills where they were the lead sponsors.

In the House of Representatives, 17 of the 360-members (4.7 percent) are women. Still, they are making their mark. Chair of the House Committee on Women Affairs and Social Development, Hon. Kafilat Ogbara, has warned that Nigeria’s democratic project is incomplete without women’s meaningful participation.

At the state level, the gaps are even wider. 15 Houses of Assembly have no female representatives. For those who made it in, they are proving their mettle. Ekiti State stands out with six of the 26 seats held by women. Three of them occupy top positions: Deputy Speaker Hon. Bolaji Olagbaju, Chief Whip Hon. Olowookere Bosede Yinka, and the Deputy Chief Whip Hon. Ogunlade Maryam Bimbola.

Hon.Olagbaju has been outspoken the stakes: “How can a committee meant to discuss women’s issues be headed by a man? It is that bad,” she said at a recent dialogue in Abuja, highlighting why representation matters.

Kwara State tells a similar story: five women were elected to the 24-member Assembly. Among them, Hon. Medinat AbdulRaheem Motunrayo is Deputy House Leader, and Hon. Yusuf Maryam is the Deputy Chief Whip.

There have been glimmers of progress. In 2007, 35 women were elected to the 6th National Assembly, with 8 Senators and 27 Members. That Assembly produced Nigeria’s first female Speaker of the House, Hon. Patricia Etteh.

The 7th National Assembly made progess with the appointment of Hon. Mulikat Akande as the first female Majority Leader. While in the 8th, beginning in August 2018, Senator Biodun Olujimi took over as Deputy Minority Whip, and later rose to Senate Minority Leader, demonstrating both competence and influence.

In the 9th Assembly Hon Nkeiruka Onyejeocha, as Deputy Chief Whip, took a bold step by sponsoring the original version of the Special Seats Bill. Despite its contentious nature, she successfully mobilised 85 co-sponsors, including the then Speaker, demonstrating early leadership on the issue.

But each gain proved fragile. Breakthroughs were followed by setbacks, exposing structural barriers, from cultural bias to weak party support, that still hold women back.

Lawmakers are now reviewing the reintroduced Special Seats Bill – a constitutional amendment proposal currently before the National Assembly, also known as the Seat Reservation for Women Bill (HB1349). This proposed constitutional amendment would introduce additional seats to be contested exclusively by women: 74 in the National Assembly and 108 across state assemblies.

These additonal seats would not replace existing seats, but complement them, an affirmative action creating a temporary but necessary boost to representation.

Deputy Speaker of the House of Representative, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, has consistently described it as temporary special measure, modeled on successful initiatives in countries like Rwanda and Senegal. As he put it: “Democracy thrives not just on elections, but inclusion.”

Several African countries have adopted measures to address similar gaps. Rwanda’s constitution mandates at least 30 per cent female representation in all decision-making bodies, and women now hold more than 60 per cent of parliamentary seats.

Kenya’s 2010 constitution introduced a “two-thirds gender principle” and created new Woman Representative positions. While Uganda reserves one parliamentary seat per district for a “District Woman Representative,” a pathway that helped Rebecca Kadaga rise to become Speaker of Parliament.

These measures show intentional design and strucutal fixes can be work, especially in political cultures where women have been excluded. While gender bills have stumbled before, supporters argue that the Special Seats Bill offers a pragmatic path forward. Advocates also stress that representation must be intersectional. Lois Auta, Global President of the Network of Women with Disabilities, has called for the special seats to recognise women with disabilities to reflect full diversity.

As Minister of Women Affairs, Hajiya Imaan Sulaiman-Ibrahim, described it, the proposal is “a constitutional corrective, long overdue, to ensure democracy works for all citizens.”

As public awareness grows, so too does a note of caution. At a recent webinar organised by the Policy and Legal Advocacy Centre (PLAC), Omolara Akinyeye, Deputy Executive Director, observed that while “awareness is growing and support for women in politics is strong, the real test lies in transforming that energy into citizens’ demands on their representatives.” She added that these demands would ultimately translate into actual votes on the floor of the National Assembly. PLAC research estimates that implementing the Bill would cost less than one percent of the national budget.

As the constitutional review process moves forward, that link between awareness and action has already been tested during the zonal hearings. The next step is the National Assembly’s public hearing on September 22, another chance for citizens to engage, advocate, and influence the debate on the Bill.

"When you lift a woman, you transform a whole community– Tobore Anne Emorhokpor","Tobore Anne Emorhokpor, Assoc CIPD, MPharm, is a passionate community leader, philanthropist, and advocate for women and children. She is the founder of Nigerian Women in the UK (NWIU), a thriving network of over 18,000 women providing vital support in safeguarding, childcare, domestic abuse, and welfare services. Born in Nigeria and raised in the UK, Tobore has spent nearly a decade funding education, healthcare, and small businesses for families, while empowering women to find their voice and achieve financial independence. She also leads Michrichmeg Ltd, teaching digital skills and AI, and partners with Utility Warehouse to help families save and build income. Recognised with awards such as Mumpreneur of the Year (2025) and the Right Livelihood Award (2021), Tobore continues to champion resilience, empowerment, and community building. A wife and mother of three, she embodies the spirit of leadership and service, inspiring women to thrive without limits.

Passion to Support Women and Children

My passion is rooted in my personal journey. I was born in Nigeria and moved to the UK at the age of 16. I’ve seen first-hand the struggles women face both here and back home, poverty, abuse, lack of opportunities, and barriers to thriving. For the past nine years, I’ve been directly involved in helping women and children in Nigeria overcome hardship and abuse. I started small, simply using my Facebook page to share resources and signpost survivors to help. Over time, people began reaching out to me directly whenever they saw a woman or child in need. Through my network, we were able to mobilise support, whether it was paying school fees, covering medical care, or helping women set up businesses. My family, friends, and even strangers online have been part of this journey. For me, it’s not charity, it’s a calling. I believe when you lift a woman, you transform a whole community.

Founding Nigerian Women in the UK (NWIU)

Six years ago, I noticed how many Nigerian women in the UK felt isolated, unsupported, and misunderstood. That’s why I started Nigerian Women in the UK (NWIU), as a safe space where women could share experiences, build friendships, and lift one another up. What began as a simple Facebook group has now grown into a thriving community of over 18,000 women, spread across 14 regional Telegram groups. In May 2024, I officially registered NWIU as a Community Interest Company to structure our work better and expand our reach. Today, we run events, mentorship programmes, welfare initiatives, and even international retreats. In the past year alone, we’ve handled over 150 safeguarding cases, helping women navigate social services or supporting children through bullying. The impact has been incredible to witness.

Proudest Achievements

For me, the proudest achievement is seeing transformation happen. Women who once felt voiceless are now stepping into leadership, launching businesses, finding jobs, and leaving abusive situations with the help of our community. Every single story of change, no matter how small, is a win worth celebrating.

Motivation to Keep Giving

I know what it feels like to struggle, and I also know the difference just one helping hand can make. My motivation comes from the joy of seeing lives change, whether it’s a child returning to school, a woman finally being able to feed her children, or a family regaining hope. Those moments remind me why I do this work and fuel me to keep going.

Balancing Multiple Roles

Balancing NWIU, Michrichmeg Ltd, and my work with Utility Warehouse is not always easy, but I’ve learned to integrate my passions. Michrichmeg Ltd allows me to teach digital products, AI, and finance skills that empower women to earn from home. Utility Warehouse gives me a platform to help families save money and build side incomes. NWIU ties it all together by creating a supportive community. At the heart of it all is the same mission: to help women live better lives.

Recognition and Awards

Recognition is always an honour, but for me, awards are less about personal achievement and more about the women I represent. They shine a light on resilience, courage, and strength within our communities. Personally, they remind me that my work matters. Professionally, they open doors and platforms where I can advocate for even more women.

Family as My Anchor

My family is my anchor. My husband is incredibly supportive and constantly encourages me to aim higher. My three children inspire me daily, they are the reason I keep pushing. I won’t pretend it’s easy, but I prioritise, delegate when necessary, and make sure I’m fully present for the important moments.

Women Who Inspire Me

Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala – for breaking barriers globally and proving women can lead at the highest levels. Michelle Obama – for her grace, authenticity, and commitment to empowering young people. My mother – for her resilience, sacrifices, and quiet strength, which shaped who I am today.

Vision for the Future

In the next five years, I want to expand NWIU by establishing a physical community hub in the UK, a safe space where women can access mentorship, welfare, and empowerment programs. Through Michrichmeg Ltd, my vision is to build digital academies that help women globally create wealth using digital products and AI. With Utility Warehouse, my aim is to support at least 500 families in achieving financial relief. Above all, my dream is simple: to see Nigerian women everywhere thrive without limitations.",https://guardian.ng/guardian-woman/when-you-lift-a-woman-you-transform-a-whole-community-tobore-anne-emorhokpor/,https://guardian.ng
Back to school digital reset for the family,"As children return to classrooms after the summer-long break, parents have a chance to reset family rules, tackle AI head-on, and model healthier tech habits.

September doesn’t just mark the end of the holidays; it’s the perfect time for a digital reset. Over the summer, children often get more screen time than anyone bargained for. From endless TikTok loops to late-night gaming, devices creep into every waking hour. With school back in session, families need to reset boundaries, refresh routines, and make sure children are ready for learning.

When I speak to parents and educators, one theme always comes up: worry. Worry about screen time. Worry about inappropriate content. Worry about AI, which many admit they don’t fully understand themselves. Our Parental Attitudes Survey of parents across Nigeria showed that 98% think about online safety often or always, and 69% say they are very concerned. Their biggest fears? Exposure to inappropriate content (81%), excessive screen time (78%), and addiction to social media (70%). Yet more than half said they don’t use parental control tools. The gap between fear and action is wide, and this back-to-school season is the moment to close it.

Here are six practical resets to guide your family’s digital life

Bedtime Digital Rules. Summer routines tend to be relaxed, but school requires structure. Start with a digital sunset: all devices are turned off at a set time and kept out of bedrooms. Sleep is non-negotiable for learning, and blue light from screens makes it harder to wind down. If your home has never had digital rules, this is the perfect time to introduce them. Children might initially resist this, but over time, they will notice they are well rested and able to concentrate better.

Talk About AI and Ethics. AI isn’t futuristic; it’s already shaping how children learn. More and more children are using AI tools for schoolwork. Many parents I meet admit that they’ve never spoken to their children about using AI responsibly. Blanket bans don’t work. Instead, check your child’s school policy and have honest conversations at home. Encourage your child to use AI to help with planning, revision, and brainstorming, but not to do all the heavy lifting. If they rely on it to do the work, then children aren’t developing the critical thinking they need. It is important to share examples of students who have been asked to retake classes or leave school for cheating with AI.

Address AI Companions. This summer saw a rise in children experimenting with AI “friends.” For children still building social skills, that’s risky. AI mimics empathy, but it is not empathic. Trust and connection must come from people, not algorithms. Ensure your children understand the distinction between Generative AI such as ChatGPT, and an actual person. They are created to sound human, but they are not; it is simply a computer that uses the information and data it has to give responses.

Encourage Positive Tech Use. Not all screen time is bad. The key is turning online interests into real-world skills. A child who loves cooking shows can actually cook a meal. A gamer can learn to code. A budding storyteller can publish an e-book. These bridges remind children that technology is a tool for creating, not just consuming. When parents balance their message with this, the children can visualize and practice how to use Tech for good.

Create Screen-Free Zones and Times. Children mirror what they see. If the dinner table, early mornings, and school runs are device-free for everyone, including parents, the message is clear that not every moment needs a screen. The morning commute, especially, should be sacred. Giving your child “digital junk food” on the drive to school via their phone is like handing them a sugary donut for breakfast. It delivers a quick high, followed by a crash. By the time they reach school, their brains are overstimulated and unfocused. A screen-free ride, with a book or even just looking out the window, primes their brain for learning in a way scrolling never will. Do the same with dinner time, make sure meals are screen-free to encourage open connection and communication.

Delay the Smartphone. Parents always ask: when’s the right age for a smartphone? My answer: Later is better. Sixteen is far safer than eleven. If you do hand over a device earlier, don’t leave it to chance; set it up with parental controls, time limits, and rules. Willpower isn’t enough, and the guardrails you put in place matter. Use this back-to-school season as an opportunity to reset your family’s digital habits, sharpen your children’s digital skills, and foster critical thinking. Parents are right to be concerned, but concern without action leaves children exposed. The key to digital parenting isn’t panic but preparation.

Closing gender gaps could add $229B to Nigeria’s GDP — Foreign Affairs Minister,"The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Yusuf Maitama Tuggar, has made a strong call to African governments, development partners, and the private sector to integrate gender and youth inclusion into the core of economic diplomacy, warning that without equitable growth, Africa’s transformation will remain fragile and incomplete.

Speaking at the 2025 Gender and Inclusion Summit, during a High-Level Plenary session titled “From Aid to Investment: Leveraging Economic Diplomacy for Africa’s Inclusive Development,” Tuggar said that the time has come for the continent to move from dialogue to deliberate action.

The summit, organised by the Policy Innovation Centre, brought together leaders from across sectors to explore pathways for inclusive prosperity on the continent.

“Africa stands at the cusp of transformation. With a projected population of 2.5 billion by 2050 and a current GDP of $2.8 trillion, we possess the human capital and resources to drive global growth. But growth without inclusivity is fragile, and prosperity without equity is unsustainable,” Tuggar said.

Drawing from the Council on Foreign Relations’ 2019 report, the Minister presented striking data on the cost of exclusion.“If women participated in the Nigerian economy at the same rate as men, our GDP could increase by $229 billion by 2025. This isn’t just a social issue; it’s a direct economic imperative,” he noted.

Tuggar outlined the ongoing inequalities facing women across the continent, pointing to education, economic participation, and political representation as the most pressing barriers. He cited a 2024 UNESCO report showing that 7.6 million Nigerian girls are currently out of school, with nearly half of them in the North-West and North-East.

“In Africa, women comprise 70% of the informal economy but remain largely excluded from formal trade structures. In Nigeria, women hold only 4.2% of seats in the National Assembly, far below Africa’s average of 27.3%. This underrepresentation in governance, business, and finance is a missed opportunity for growth,” he stated.

He also highlighted disparities in education, noting that only 69% of African girls complete primary school compared to 73% of boys, while just 43% of girls finish lower secondary school.

In response to Nigeria’s inclusive foreign policy shift under 4-D diplomacy agenda, Tuggar revealed that Nigeria’s foreign policy has been recalibrated under President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s 4-D Diplomacy Agenda, focused on Development, Demography, Diaspora, and Democracy, all anchored in inclusivity.

“Nigeria required a foreign policy with a fresh, all-inclusive purpose. Each pillar of our diplomacy now prioritises the inclusion of women and youth, not just as beneficiaries, but as co-creators of policy and prosperity,” he said.

This approach, he said, has birthed regional initiatives such as the Regional Partnership for Democracy (RPD), which aims to foster accountable governance by strengthening democratic institutions and promoting equitable participation. “Central to the mission of RPD is ensuring that women and youth are not just present, but empowered economically and politically,” Tuggar explained.

He also referenced the West Africa Economic Summit (WAES), hosted in Abuja earlier this year, which resolved to dismantle barriers to finance, cross-border opportunities, and market access for women.

Tuggar cautioned that without targeted interventions, even promising trade initiatives like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) could perpetuate exclusion.

He however praised Nigerian financial institutions such as UBA, Access Bank, GTCO, First Bank, and Zenith Bank for their leadership in cross-border banking and digital integration, and commended the growing presence of women CEOs in top financial roles.

“These systems, designed to boost trade, can inadvertently become barriers if women lack access to development finance, digital tools, and regional networks. This is a positive trend, but we must accelerate it. Women must lead, not just participate,” he said.",https://guardian.ng/guardian-woman/closing-gender-gaps-could-add-229b-to-nigerias-gdp-foreign-affairs-minister/,https://guardian.ng
The psychology of scams: Why smart people fall for them,"I have been a prosecutor for a while now and I can authoritatively tell you that fraudsters are not just criminals; they are master manipulators of human psychology. They study how people think, what they fear, and what they desire — then they use this knowledge to trick even the most intelligent and careful individuals. This explains why bankers, lawyers, professors, business executives, and civil servants sometimes lose millions to Scammers.

Contrary to the general perception, I can confidently tell you that falling victim to fraud is not a sign of stupidity; it is a result of psychological manipulation.

How do the Scammers succeed?

Distinguished readers, please let’s examine the Scammers’ three most powerful weapons.

1. The Weapon of Urgency – “Act Now or Lose Out”

From the various schemes of fraud that I have either prosecuted or privileged to “cracked” I found that scammers know that when people feel rushed, they stop thinking critically. A common trick is to send messages like:

“Your bank account will be blocked in one hour unless you confirm your PIN.”

“Pay today or you will miss out on this investment opportunity.”

By creating panic, they push victims into making hasty decisions. But here’s the truth: legitimate institutions never force you to act instantly under pressure. If a message makes you feel rushed, it’s a red flag. Please take this from me.

2.The Weapon of Authourity – “Trust Me, I’m From the Bank”

I also found from experience that fraudsters often pretend to be officials from government agencies, banks, or even law enforcement. They use language that sounds official, fake ID cards, or cloned websites to win trust.

But remember: fraudsters wear the mask of authority because they know Nigerians respect titles and institutions. That is why you must always verify independently. Don’t call the number in the message; call the official customer care line. Don’t click suspicious links; go directly to the bank’s verified website. Please do some independent due diligence.

3. The Weapon of Greed and Fear of Missing Out – “Double Your Money Quickly”

For Ponzi schemes, fake crypto investments, and “wonder banks” they all rely on this to defraud their victims. They promise unrealistic returns: “Invest ₦100,000 today and get ₦200,000 in one week!” Greed blinds judgment. People know it sounds too good to be true, but they still invest out of fear that others will profit while they are left behind. Unfortunately, such schemes always collapse, leaving victims in tears.

Why Even Smart People Fall

Scammers don’t target ignorance; they target human emotions. Everyone — whether educated or not — can feel pressure, fear, greed, or trust. That is why no one should ever say, “I am too smart to be scammed.”

How to Outsmart the Scammer

To protect yourself and your loved ones, keep these simple rules in mind:

• Pause before you pay – never act under pressure.

• Verify the source – check directly with your bank, company, or agency.

• Consult someone you trust – two sets of eyes see clearer than one.

• Listen to your instincts – if something feels wrong, it probably is.

Final Word

My final word on this is fraudsters may be smart, but you can be smarter. By understanding their psychological tricks, you can resist their pressure and protect your hard-earned money. Remember this rule and constantly apply it:

If it sounds too good to be true, it is too good to be true. Dear reader, please don’t stay silent. Fraud thrives when victims keep quiet. If you encounter a scam attempt, report it to the appropriate law enforcement agencies of the government or your bank.

Akerele on challenges of public sector reform,"SIR: At a time when governance challenges dominate public discourse and the demand for institutional reform grows louder, Nigerian scholar Dr. Olusegun Oladapo Akerele has become a notable contributor to debates on public sector reform for public sector transformation.

Akerele, who holds a PhD in Administrative Sciences, has dedicated his career to understanding how motivation, performance systems, and institutional structures can be reconfigured to deliver better outcomes for societies. His research, widely cited internationally, combines rigorous academic inquiry with a deep commitment to practical application.

“Good governance is not only about the policies we write, but also about how we design systems that encourage people within institutions to perform at their best,” he says, articulating the principle that drives his work.

A global research footprint

Among his many contributions, Akerele has developed a benchmarking model for aligning public-sector incentives with performance outcomes, a framework discussed at recent policy forums in Africa and Europe. His comparative study on incentive systems across Africa and Europe, published in 2024, has been highlighted as a tool for civil service reform and sustainable development.

Independent experts have affirmed this impact. Professor Daniela Lenuta Zirra of the Romanian-American University notes: “Dr. Akerele’s frameworks combine scholarly depth with practical adaptability. His work demonstrates how research can move beyond theory to shape policy reform.”

National recognition and professional standing

Dr. Akerele’s work is not limited to academia. He is an Associate Member of the Chartered Institute of Transport Administration of Nigeria (CIoTA) the only statutory body established under Federal Government Act No. 27 of 2019 to regulate and professionalise transport administration. His admission to CIoTA marks his entry into the government-recognised body regulating transport administration in Nigeria.

He has also served in key scholarly roles, including as a Guest Editor for an international Special Issue of Administrative Sciences and as a peer reviewer for over a dozen globally indexed journals. His contributions to editorial and peer review processes further underscore his recognition as an authority in his field.

Related News

Shaping next phase of governance innovation

For Akerele, scholarship is not an end in itself, but a bridge to policy innovation. His models have been cited by independent researchers across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, demonstrating both the versatility and the applicability of his work.

Looking forward, he intends to expand his contributions in the United States, working with universities, think tanks, and government agencies to strengthen public administration, improve workforce accountability, and develop sustainable governance frameworks. His vision aligns closely with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth).

“Research should not remain in journals. Its value is in how it informs institutional practice and, ultimately, improves people’s lives,” he reflects.

A scholar of impact

Akerele’s trajectory from Nigerian scholar to globally recognised academic leader illustrates the growing impact of African voices in global governance debates. His blend of scholarly rigor, professional recognition, and policy relevance ensures that his contributions resonate far beyond the classroom.

As nations search for solutions to the complex governance challenges of the 21st century, voices like Akerele’s will play an increasingly critical role. As debates on governance reform intensify across Africa, Akerele says he hopes his work will remain rooted in practical outcomes.

“Research should not remain in journals. Its value is in how it informs institutional practice and, ultimately, improves people’s lives,” he reflects.

His benchmarking model has been referenced by independent scholars in policy forums, and governance analysts in Nigeria say the framework adds to the growing conversation about how to align public-sector performance with accountability.

Da Sylva on good news from Ghana,"What are political leaders for in a destitute time? I must state straightaway that the question I have just asked is not an originally original one penned by me. I appropriated it from the German poet and philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) who quoted his fellow German poet Friedrich Holderlin (1770-1843). The question Holderlin asked in his elegy “Bread and Wine” and which Heidegger the phenomenologist quoted in one of his 1936 pivotal essays “What Are the Poets For” was “… what are poets for in a destitute time?” The word “time” in Holderlin’s and Heidegger’s usage meant the respective eras to which they belonged. In my appropriation here, it means the era to which we as Nigerians (or as West Africans) belong.

Last Friday this column focused on the subject of one-of-a kind Nigerian leader lacking in our current time. The gleaner and glimpser did what he needed to do based on our historical experience. Of course, after the column saw the light of day, the news of Ghana’s educational revolution courtesy of Mr John Mahama, Ghana’s current president, hit my phone. It was a detailed news report that captured what the president of Ghana’s bold new vision for his country’s future would be.

President John Mahama is giving Ghana a divine radiance with his announcement that tuition is going to be free henceforth in all public universities. In fact, this new policy is with immediate effect. President John Mahama is pulling his country out of its destitute time. He is emerging in this gleaner and glimpser’s poetic consciousness as one-of-a-kind Ghanaian political leader. He is turning his age, his era, from its present abyss into a new one, a radiantly new one, because the right time has arrived. I sent the video of John Mahama’s golden revolution to friends and diverse WhatsApp platforms after my poetically revolutionary heart and mind.

Professor Ademola Da Sylva, distinguished poet and literary scholar, and a Fellow of the highly and visibly prestigious Nigerian Academy of Letters, was one of those persons. What this quiet radical literary gem who is one of the champions of how to stop the spreading of peacelessness in our country offers as a response to the good news from Ghana, is what I deem necessary to quote now verbatim. It will give me real poetic and political pleasure to see you enjoy Professor Da Sylva’s rich offering.

“It is called actual investment; when you invest in the people, a better future is guaranteed. Ghana knew that long ago, it was the reason that Chief Awolowo’s regional government had to borrow a chunk of its governance template from Kwame Nkrumah, including the idea of the Modern School 1-3, to meet the urgent supply of teaching personnel for his free education schemes and the Technical School Education to empower the youth with necessary artisanship skills. That was before the military struck in Ghana, and much later in Nigeria. The rest is history.

“Can Nigeria afford to take the same step that Ghana has taken right now? Yes and No. Nigeria, no doubt, has the resources, both human and natural; unfortunately, its leadership is neither wired nor in any way futuristic to appreciate and to pursue similar vision as Ghana’s. Unfortunately, again, right now, Nigeria’s ruling class cannot afford free tuition for students, nor free education at all levels, no, not after PBAT’s government has increased the President’s and VP’s salaries by 114 per cent, and the Judiciary by 300 per cent or so, and given the legislature a free hand to determine the humongous salary and allowances for itself; ditto other political office holders and their jumbo pay also. This of course is contrary to intelligent reasoning requiring a drastic cut in the cost of governance! Apparently, it is clearer now than ever that Nigeria exists for the political class.

“I also observe that Nigerian people are pleased with the ongoing looting and the characteristic avarice on the part of the political class, in particular, the ruling class and the elite-collaborators! The people, as if on a queue, are simply and hopefully waiting for their turns. I am not even sure if Nigerians care any longer whatever these weird folks do to their country.

“Ghana and the rest of the world have moved forward, leaving clueless African leaders and their mumu masses behind. In the Nigerian context, unless something drastic happens by way of divine intervention, should the sky fall, it would fall on everyone, and none would be spared”.

Professor Da Sylva may be right. But I can assure him – and I am assuring him – that The Galactic Federation will not allow the sky to fall on everyone. Only the fugitive stealers and wreckers of our dreams as Nigerians and as Africans will remain where they will remain forever in their created destitute or abyss of fugitive fate.

But I must end the column with these poetic lines:

“… The heavenly powers

Cannot do all things. It is the mortals

Who reach sooner into the abyss. So the turn is

with these. Long is

The time, but the true comes into

The campaign of calumny against Tunji-Ojo over 2027,"Recently, the Director General of the Progressive Network for Tinubu, Pastor Olumide Obadele, dismissed speculations of a rift between the Ondo State Governor, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, and the Minister of Interior, Hon. Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, over the 2028 governorship election. Obadele was reacting to rumors that Tunji-Ojo is eyeing the governorship seat, and thus at odds with the governor, who naturally wants a second term of office.

Speaking with journalists in Akure at the unveiling of the support group, Obadele maintained: “Ondo APC is one family. No issue between the two of them, to the best of my knowledge. The governor is our governor, the minister is our own, and the party is our party. Engr. Ade Adetimehin is the chairman of our party.” He then sounded a note of warning: “This is not a campaign effort as INEC has yet to open the window for electioneering campaigns. Our conviction stems from President Tinubu’s ability to bring Nigeria to a turning point in just 27 months.”

In the arena of politics, different factors and forces come into play. That is perhaps natural. But not all the forces are for good: some are perennially driven by self-interest. Others simply by the tide, hanging on to political power and patronage.

For Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, Minister of Interior, the situation is remarkably different. He is a patriot and his mission is to crystallise development by actualising the Renewed Hope Agenda of his principal and Commander-in-Chief. Resolutely anchored on the Agenda and giving no quarter to the men, systems and ways of yesteryears, Tunji-Ojo has shown more than fidelity to President Tinubu’s agenda: he has shown faith, passion and consistency.

He has shown total commitment to the President’s objective of using public office as a tool of empowerment, as a mechanism for driving the development narrative, opening up new frontiers. He is committed to charting new pathways and making the business of governance more transparent, less encumbered, and fit for purpose. The massive changes in the passport application and renewal process, in the management of Nigeria’s borders and airports, and in the workings of the various agencies and departments under the ministry, including the NSCDC, Nigeria Immigration Service, Nigeria Customs Service, the Fire Service and others point to this fact poignantly.

Tunji-Ojo is indeed above board. Naturally, he wants the President to have another term of office, but he has operated strictly within the bounds of the law in actualising this legitimate ambition. He has various groups galvanised to hit the campaign trail for the President’s cause once INEC gives the go-ahead for the 2027 campaigns to begin, and has given no one the impression that his loyalty to the President is for personal gain.

He was already a prodigiously distinguished federal lawmaker when the President nominated him for a cabinet position, and has pursued the President’s Renewed Hope Agenda with vigour ever since, firm in his conviction that the best way to sell a government to the populace is to record a spectacular performance in office.

Approaching his job as Interior Minister with absolute dedication to the President’s cause, Tunji-Ojo knows, as the Good Book says, that “The integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity. (Proverbs 11:3). In Act 1, Scene 1 of William Shakespeare’s Richard II, we read these enchanting words about loyalty: “Mine honour is my life; both grow in one: Take honour from me, and my life is done.” That, quite simply, is the minister’s mindset.

Pray, just how is a cabinet minister loyal to his principal and assiduously pursuing the presidential agenda a self-serving politician as some despicable characters within the Ondo APC fold have been claiming in their distorted and jaundiced mindset? The voice, as they say, is that of Jacob while the hand is that of Esau.

Finding no black record with which to nail the minister, these agents of subversion have been desperately angling to craft a non-existent push for a power grab. Should the Interior Minister nurse a governorship ambition, he would, in his characteristic forthrightness, never have made secret of his desire. He did not lobby to be made a minister: he was simply doing what his people in the Akoko North East/Akoko North West Federal Constituency of Ondo State elected him to do when the presidential nod for a cabinet position came calling. And now that he is minister, he is similarly focused on his assignment and on advancing the cause of his principal, not engaging in sybaritic struggle for gubernatorial power with anyone.

In just two years, President Bola Tinubu’s Renewed Hope leadership has made significant strides in strengthening internal security organs. Key achievements include improved border management and immigration processes through digital systems, clearance of 204,332 passport backlog within three weeks, introduction of home and office delivery of passports, streamlined application process and championing of Nigerian applicants’ rights abroad, creation of a state-of-the-art Data Centre and Command and Control Centre; setting up of E-Gates at airports to enhance security and efficiency; and rehabilitation of correctional centers.

An Immigration Service Reform Committee established to enhance efficiency and reduce corruption, the Digital Case Management System implemented to streamline case handling, while correctional services reform focused on rehabilitation and reintegration of inmates. Today Nigerians are familiar with notable initiatives such as Electronic Visa (e-Visa), Landing and Exit Cards (LEC), Advance Passenger Information (API), Migrant Information Management System (MIMS) and thr Centralised Interior Management and Administration System (CIMAS).

The impact has been massive: improved security and efficiency in border management and immigration processes, enhanced morale and productivity among paramilitary officers, increased transparency and accountability in governance, and support for educational programs, healthcare initiatives, and empowerment projects in communities.

President Tinubu’s leadership has demonstrated a commitment to transforming institutions and uplifting Nigerian society through effective leadership and innovation. That is the message that the Minister of Interior has been propagating. He will not be distracted.

"With Call to Love Summer Camp, Akingbohungbe impacts over 100 children","Passionate about impacting children, teachers and parents to learn, imbibe creativity and mentorship, the Call to Love Summer Camp brought together over 100 participants to a weeklong programme.

Organised for pupils of Primaries five and six, the summer camp provided classes in artificial intelligence, graphic design, sewing, music, waste management, and environmental protection and more. It also included mentorship sessions for teachers and exposure trips aimed at broadening the children’s horizons.

Speaking at its ninth graduation ceremony, the convener, Mrs. Omowunmi Akingbohungbe noted that the camp’s main goal is to prevent school dropouts during the long summer break. “Research shows that many children in Primary five and six begin working with their parents during the holidays, and some never return to school, this programme bridges that gap, keeps them engaged, and motivates them to continue their education.”

While highlighting other impact stories, she noting that children from past editions have gone on to win scholarships, represent their schools in competitions, and even mentor their peers while some alumni are already giving back; returning this year as facilitators and volunteers to the initiative.

“That is the vision for our beneficiaries to become strong enough to pay it forward. The beauty about what we do at Call to Love is that even after the one-week summer camp, our journey with them does not end. That one week gives us an opportunity to know them, their strengths, their weaknesses, and how we can support.

Akingbohungbe restated the long-term goal of building a permanent center for after-school clubs and holiday camps. She emphasised that sustainability is key: “We want to create a space where children can continue to learn, explore, and innovate even after the summer. This is how we break the cycle of school dropouts. It is not just about a week in August, but about giving them continuity and hope.”",https://guardian.ng/guardian-angels/with-call-to-love-summer-camp-akingbohungbe-impacts-over-100-children/,https://guardian.ng
Jemima Adelekan’s travel and lifestyle project begins across Nigeria,"Jemima Adelekan, a dynamic actor, lifestyle creator, entrepreneur, and media strategist, has embarked on a bold new travel and lifestyle project that aims to showcase Nigeria region by region, uncovering hidden gems and telling stories beyond the glossy postcards.

Fresh from her first leg exploring the Western States of Nigeria, Adelekan says her mission is to “capture the beauty, complexity, and truth of places through her own lens” while inspiring Nigerians and global audiences to rediscover the magic in everyday details. “I started traveling because I believe the world deserves to be seen beyond its postcards,” Adelekan explained. “It’s in the smell of fresh bread from a family bakery, the laughter in a small-town market, or the pride of a craftsman sharing his work. These are the human details that make a place come alive.”

Adelekan describes herself first as a storyteller, a role that has informed her work as an actor, writer, entrepreneur, and media strategist. According to her, each identity has sharpened the other: “My architectural training makes me see structure and detail, writing deepens my performances, and strategy allows me to connect meaningfully with audiences. For me, these identities are not separate, they are different lenses through which I see and shape the world.”

Her travels through Owo in Ondo State, for instance, revealed that beyond history and landscapes, the real story was the warmth of the people. In Oyo State, her visit to the mystical Sugidi Lake, where locals believe fish cannot be cooked, shifted her perspective on travel. “It made me realize travel is not just about pretty places, but about the soul of a place: its traditions, beliefs, and wonders.”

At a time when many destinations are reduced to “Instagram-famous” backdrops, Adelekan says she is determined to keep her storytelling authentic. She slows down in each place, listens to locals, and prioritises human connections over staged moments.

“I don’t just chase the prettiest angle. I focus on the heartbeat of the place, the voices, the sounds, the small details that make it real,” she noted.

Her goal is not only to reach avid travelers but also those who may never get the chance to see the world physically. “I want them to feel like they’ve travelled with me, not just watched me travel.”

Adelekan chose to begin her journey in the Western States because they are both “familiar and misunderstood.” She hopes to challenge stereotypes, including the assumption that modernization has erased traditions. “Beneath the busy cities, the culture is very much alive in the festivals, the crafts, the food, and the stories.”

Her project, which will gradually cover all regions of Nigeria, is as much about discovery as it is about connection. She believes travel fosters empathy, helping people see life through the eyes of others. “It stops being their culture and becomes a shared human experience.”

While passion fuels her journey, Jemima Adelekan acknowledges the challenge of building a sustainable brand around her work. She is exploring partnerships with tourism boards, brands, and local businesses that align with her values, ensuring her audience can trust her voice.

“If there’s one mindset shift, I want to inspire, it’s this: you don’t have to travel across the world to experience wonders. There is beauty, history, and culture right where you are. Sometimes, it’s right in your own backyard.”

With her mix of artistry, entrepreneurship, and media strategy, Jemima Adelekan is positioning herself as one of Nigeria’s most compelling new travel storytellers, bringing audiences closer to the heart of places, one journey at a time.",https://guardian.ng/guardian-angels/jemima-adelekans-travel-and-lifestyle-project-begins-across-nigeria/,https://guardian.ng
"Back to School campaign brings nourishment, support to students, teachers","As children across Nigeria prepare to return to classrooms, a new back-to-school campaign by Maltina, a leading malt drink has been launched to give learners a boost of nourishment and celebrate the teachers who guide them.

Unveiled at the Lagos Marriott Hotel in Lagos, this marks a significant step in Maltina’s mission to nourish families, support learners and celebrate the teachers who inspire them. The initiative introduces child-friendly pack sizes – 25cl PET bottle – designed with school lunches in mind; alongside larger family-friendly options – 50cl PET bottle – aimed at providing extra value for households.

Marketing Director at Nigerian Breweries Plc., Sarah Agha, said, “For nearly five decades, we have focused on sharing happiness and fuelling togetherness across generations. This new chapter is about deepening our promise: making nourishment fit the needs of every Nigerian family.”

Beyond the shelves, the campaign includes a nationwide back-to-school tour that pledges to reach one million students with nourishment this academic term. The programme also builds on longstanding initiatives that honour educators, including the annual Teacher of the Year award.

Portfolio Manager for Non-Alcoholic Drinks, Elohor Olumide-Awe, explained the focus: “The 25cl bottle gives children the right portion to keep them energised in school, while the 50cl ensures families and young people have more of what they love. But our bigger goal is ensuring no child is left without the energy to learn and succeed.”

2024 Maltina Teacher of the Year, Esomnofu Chidiebube, noted: “As a teacher, nothing gives me greater joy than seeing a brand like Maltina commit not only to nourishing students but also to celebrating educators. The truth is, effective learning cannot happen without proper nourishment. With this Back-to-School campaign, Maltina is showing that they understand the real foundation of our future: healthy children who are ready to learn, and teachers who are empowered to guide them.”",https://guardian.ng/guardian-angels/back-to-school-campaign-brings-nourishment-support-to-students-teachers/,https://guardian.ng

Tell us about your background

Growing up was extremely fun; we spent time in Ilesa, Osun State with our grandparents every holiday. I am one of a set of twins and the first (Taiwo), was therefore considered the oldest grandchild and was responsible for everyone else. I imbibed from them and my parents the ethics of integrity, hard work, and excellence, as well as that of a good name. I decided when I was 10, that I was going to study computer science after a computer class in primary school. Playing games was a joyous pastime during computer lessons and even though I had no idea all it entailed, I was interested in studying the machine that gave me so much joy. I studied computer science with mathematics at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife, Osun State.

Problem-solving gives me great satisfaction. I was the child adults called to dial numbers on the old Nitel rotary phones, as I was patient enough to keep dialing until I got through. I look back to those times as building blocks for developing grit for the times ahead, where I would stare hard at my computer screen trying to debug code. My working life started, thanks to the various Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) strikes, while I was still an undergraduate. I had the fortune of working in small information technology (IT) firms where I was thrown to the deep end from day one. It was hard, but the experience was worth it and helped me secure a good job while I finished my service year. I was a programmer and worked with character-based interfaces. This makes me a bit envious of young programmers today who have generative AI tools as their pair programmers or even doing their grunt work for them. I am responsible for my company’s Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) application, which caters to all our back-office operations.

At age 30, I suffered a mild stroke. This wasn’t surprising given my unhealthy lifestyle, my diet consisted mostly of soft drinks and biscuits, my penchant for hunching over my screen most of the day and driving in Lagos traffic for hours, and my terrible sleep cycle. This, preceded by a traumatic birth experience was the wake-up call I needed to pause and slow down. The change did not occur overnight, but I’m a firm advocate now for unplugging and really seeing the world. My pause allows me to enjoy the beauty that I had failed to appreciate. There is so much beauty that is wasted when we fail to enjoy it. The ability to unplug leads to balance; some others may call it integration. Whatever the term used, the important thing is to live with a ‘why’ that ensures you are not off-kilter. To achieve this balance, my love for travel, my love for gardening and reading, especially biographies, and most importantly my Christian faith are things that I draw heavily on.

What are the key traits or habits women need to cultivate to be the best version of themselves?

The ability to pause and rest. The average woman is on the move, and if you ask when the last time, they had some downtime or me-time or were engaged in activities that had nothing to do with helping anyone else but themselves was, they might be hard-pressed to answer. It is not selfish to care for yourself. Loving others stems from loving yourself first. Women need to understand their rhythm and the ebbs and flows of life. This will ensure that they do not continuously pouring out and unable to refill their cups. It is essential to rest. When you unplug, you become aware of the things happening around you. You slow down enough to take in your environment and see things happening and respond appropriately. Enjoy and relish the moments, the scenery, the sun rising, the moon glowing, your children’s laughter, and even your own laughter. I remember a moment I had in the middle of combining an MBA with full-time work; it was so pressure-filled that I would snap at my children playing near me. I took a much-needed break by going on vacation with my friends and sister, and when I came back, I started to enjoy their play. Nothing about my situation had changed, the MBA was still on, and I was still working, but I had reset, and that made a difference. Consequently, I admonish people, especially women to go on holiday. It can be a one-day staycation or a full week or two of rest but unplugging from a demanding life is absolutely essential. Appreciate beauty scheduling a visit to a garden, a museum, the beach, an art gallery, a forest reserve, a travel trip.

How do you maintain a balance between your professional and personal life?

I try to maintain a balance by being myself. I realise I don’t have two different halves, nor do I have a Jekyll and Hyde personality trait that sees me acting one way outside and another way inside. I have learned to, especially with the benefit of time and maturity, know what works for me and adjust. One is balanced at some times and off balance at others. At the office, I focus on the task at hand. Everything personal is out of the way. When I get home in the evening, I unwind and leave work at the office. I might have to spend 20 minutes unwinding but I have learned to continuously assess and reflect. Unplugging helps reflection. Breathing exercises, playing, and exercising have also helped me.

When you reflect on your career, what do you hope your legacy will be in the sector?

Simplifying technology. Bridging the gaps between what people want to achieve and what they are able to do using technology as a lever. I want people to know I helped them solve problems simply. Technology sometimes needs demystifying not because it is difficult but because it is misunderstood. Technology should simplify lives and processes and make life easier for everyone. I remember my grandmother wondering why computerisation eliminated bank queues and tally numbers but couldn’t help people who worked in a bank close early. There are definitely several factors involved but I’d like to show people in tech that being a tech worker doesn’t have to be at the expense of their health. With the advent of artificial intelligence, the tech-worker stands a lot to gain if they correctly apply it.

Institute equip corp members with people management skills,"To equip fresh graduates with essential people management skills, enhancing their employability and leadership potential across sectors, The Chartered Institute of Personnel Management of Nigeria (CIPM) inaugurated its flagship capacity development programme for National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members at the Sagamu Orientation Camp in Ogun State.

The programme was officially flagged off by Chairman of CIPM’s Young Professionals Committee and elected Council Member, Sean Olabode Badiru, on behalf of the President and Chairman of the Governing Council, Mallam Ahmed Ladan Gobir. Addressing the corps members, Badiru shared the sentiments of the President, emphasising CIPM’s commitment to the professional development of young graduates.

“The Institute believes that building your people management capability at this stage of your journey is a strategic career investment. Whether you are an engineer, economist, or social scientist, the skills you acquire here will help you manage relationships, expectations, and outcomes effectively,” Badiru said.

“This programme is entirely free, but its value is immense: from strengthening your reputation as a reliable team member to accelerating your career, improving workplace adaptability, and positioning you as someone employers and colleagues trust to deliver results.”

Following the flag-off, Badiru delivered an engaging lecture on Essential People Management Skills, guiding corps members through the four pillars of effective leadership: managing oneself, managing up, managing across, and managing down.

On the first pillar, self-management, Badiru stressed the importance of self-awareness. He explained that understanding one’s reactions under pressure is critical to building trust and credibility. “Before you can lead others, you must first demonstrate mastery over yourself,” he told the corps members. “In moments of pressure when deadlines tighten or situations become uncomfortable people are watching. Your emotional discipline, your ability to remain composed, becomes the bedrock of your professional reputation.”

He also highlighted the value of personal accountability. “In business, ownership is everything,” Badiru advised. “When outcomes fall short, the instinct may be to shift blame. But maturity and indeed leadership shows when you step forward, accept responsibility, and focus on solutions. That kind of integrity earns you lasting trust.”

Time and task management was another key point: corps members were encouraged to plan their tasks, prioritise effectively, and learn to respectfully decline additional responsibilities when overextended.

Shifting to managing supervisors, Badiru illustrated how proactive communication can set corps members apart. “Managing up is about making your boss’s job easier. Anticipate what they need, communicate solutions not just problems and understand their priorities. When you do this, you become a trusted partner.”

The lecture also covered collaboration with peers. Corps members were advised to cultivate cooperative relationships by honouring commitments, helping colleagues succeed, and resolving conflicts promptly. Badiru explained that success in any organisation depends as much on the ability to work well with others as on individual skill.

Also speaking at the event, Chairman of CIPM Ogun State Branch, Mrs. Oladunni Olusola Adetona, highlighted the professional advantages of joining the Institute. “CIPM is more than an institution; it is a platform that equips you to compete and to lead. Through certification, workshops, and continuous learning, you gain the tools to thrive and distinguish yourself as a professional of value.”",https://guardian.ng/guardian-angels/institute-equip-corp-members-with-people-management-skills/,https://guardian.ng
FCCPC boss donates state-of-the-art auditorium to LASU,"Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Competition & Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) and former Secretary to the Lagos State Government, Mr. Tunji Bello, has donated a state-of-the-art auditorium to the Lagos State University (LASU), describing it as a legacy project to advance education and support public institutions.

Bello explained that his journey of giving back started at his 50th birthday in 2011 when he instituted annual scholarships in five disciplines for brilliant but indigent students from Lagos State. As his 60th birthday approached, he decided to do more and embraced the idea, first suggested by his wife, Prof. Ibiyemi Olatunji-Bello, to build an auditorium for LASU.

He recalled that the project initially seemed impossible due to high construction costs, but friends and well-wishers rallied to support him, with some converting birthday gifts into financial contributions. One notable supporter, he said, opted to donate cash instead of presenting him a luxury vehicle.

Construction began in 2021 but was later threatened by inflation and the sharp fall of the naira in 2023, which nearly tripled material costs. To keep the project alive, Bello disclosed that he sold his Magodo property to ensure the work was not abandoned.

Despite the hurdles, the facility was successfully completed after three years. Bello said the auditorium represents faith, resilience, and his belief that investment in education offers the best returns.

He announced additional support measures, including free WiFi access for students courtesy of VDT Communications, and a one-year private maintenance arrangement to ensure the facility is properly managed before LASU takes full control.

Bello urged students to make the best use of the new facility, quoting the words of Benjamin Franklin inscribed at the entrance: “Investment in education pays the best interest.” He encouraged them to embrace technology and strive for academic excellence.

He expressed gratitude to God and Lagos State, noting that he once benefited from the state’s scholarship scheme. He appealed to wealthy Nigerians to emulate such gestures by supporting public universities and helping to close infrastructural gaps.

The Multi-Purpose Auditorium featuring a fully furnished 500-seater hall was commissioned on Wednesday by the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu at the Lagos State University (LASU), Epe Campus. The construction of the complex began in 2021, when Tunji Bello turned 60. Instead of celebrating the milestone with a traditional party, he opted to channel resources into the meaningful project, encouraging friends and well-wishers to contribute funds towards the construction.

"Five years after, NSSF affirms commitment to health equity","…with 31 million stories on solution-driven advocacy

Focused on health-equity as an organisation with a clear mandate to address Nigeria’s most pressing health issues through youth advocacy and policy development, The Nigeria Solidarity Support Fund (NSSF) marked its fifth anniversary in Lagos.

With the theme, ‘Five Years, Thirty-One Million Stories’, the event celebrated the Fund’s impact on more than 31 million Nigerians while also unveiling a sharpened focus on health equity and youth-led solutions for the years ahead.

Board Chairman, Mr. Tunde Folawiyo, opened the gathering with words that brought the theme to life. “Our anniversary theme, Five Years, Thirty-One Million Stories, reminds us that every data point is a mother, a child, a family, a future. This moment is both a celebration and a recommitment.”

The anniversary was not only about reflection but also about numbers that speak to measurable change. Vice Chairman of Global Citizen and NSSF Board Member, Mr. Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, detailed the Fund’s achievements over the past five years. He said more than 22.56 million Nigerians have been educated on preventive health measures, while 12,000 frontline health workers have been trained. In addition, 4.98 million people were vaccinated against COVID-19; 156,125 children under five were immunised, and 20,651 pregnant women received tetanus-diphtheria vaccines. Beyond clinical interventions, he noted that 562 young Nigerians were trained as advocates through the WeNaija Youth Programme, and a further 1,855 were mobilised nationwide.

For Aig-Imoukhuede, the story of the Fund’s next phase lies in its commitment to health equity. “Health equity, as the name suggests, is about ensuring that healthcare and the impact of health investment goes to not just everybody, but especially to those who, for whatever reason, or maybe just because of social causes, are constrained benefiting from healthcare,” he explained.

He also highlighted how women often face the deepest inequities when it comes to access. “In Nigeria, less than seven percent of our population has access to health insurance. So, 70 percent of healthcare comes from out-of-pocket expenditure. Now think about who manages the budget of the household. I can tell you; I am married and can tell you it is my wife. So, who is the last person to get the benefit of the out-of-pocket expenditure? It is the wife, it is the woman, who is also the mother,” he observed.

“It just gives you an idea of how you just take things for granted and therefore, when you think about health equity is simply about correcting the disparities that life has unfortunately thrown up in terms of those who get access to healthcare versus those who don’t.”

As part of the milestone celebration, NSSF also announced a rebrand. Managing Director and CEO, Dr. Fejiro Chinye-Nwoko said, “Going forward, the organisation will simply be known as NSSF across all its communications. For the decision represents clarity of vision and a stronger posture. Five years ago, we began as an emergency response. Today, we stand as a health-equity organisation with a clear mandate to address Nigeria’s most pressing health issues through youth advocacy and policy development. Our work is about turning voices into evidence, and evidence into decisions that expand access to care, especially for those historically left behind,” she said.

She further explained that NSSF’s new strategy will be guided by two major strands. The first will focus on policy engagement, evidence generation, and system-level advocacy. The second, through the WeNaija programme, will mobilise young Nigerians to champion health issues, raise awareness, and contribute directly to solutions in their communities.

In her closing remarks, Chinye-Nwoko offered gratitude to the people and partners who have supported the Fund’s journey. “I would like to thank our team for doing so much work. I would stress that it is not easy working for a non-profit, but there is a heart that works for a non-profit, and a heart to give above and beyond. That is the heart that we have with NSSF,” she said.

She also thanked the advisory board, the media, the youth population, partners, and every Nigerian who has engaged with their mission. “There are people who benefited from our programmes, we care for you, and I think it is a compliment for all of us that we will continue to advocate, change policy, and ensure that vulnerable children get good quality care.”",https://guardian.ng/guardian-angels/five-years-after-nssf-affirms-commitment-to-health-equity/,https://guardian.ng
Nigeria will be better-off without politics of prebendalism – Ihua,"The Executive Director of Africa Polling Institute (API), Prof. Bell Ihua, in this interview with ADAMU ABUH, sheds light on the latest findings from the Institute’s 2025 Nigeria Social Cohesion Survey, which was recently unveiled in Abuja. He observes that more Nigerians have a proclivity towards ethnicity than nationalism, stressing that a lot needs to be done by those entrusted with the governance of the country to reverse the ugly trend.

What informed your decision to release a study on social cohesion in Nigeria?

The Africa Polling Institute has been around since 2019, and we’ve been committed to bridging the gap between the government and the governed by helping to capture the opinions, views, perspectives, and attitudes of citizens in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa on issues relating to governance, democracy, economy, markets, and public life. So, from the very hard issues, such as the economy, governance, and people’s perceptions of democracy today, to the much softer or lighter topics, like entertainment, how people relax, what comedy skits they watch, and what they love to eat for breakfast, lunch, or dinner; we straddle across board. However, I would like to start this interview by clarifying a few key points.

First, it is worth noting that the API is independent, non-profit, and non-partisan. We do not represent any commercial, political, or group interest whatsoever. I say this because we have had instances in the past where some politicians attended our events and made certain statements that a section of the media tried to affiliate us with such perspectives. No! We are independent and neutral.

Secondly, we are a group of credible professionals, men and women of integrity. What we find from our studies is what we report and publish; we do not try to paint or embellish our results to favour any section of society. I’ve been around for a while, and we have worked extremely hard to get here. Stakeholders within the industry can attest to the quality of our work.

I resigned from my lecturing job and returned to Nigeria from the United Kingdom (UK) in January 2012. Since then, I have conducted polls and surveys, working with various administrations, including those of President Goodluck Jonathan, President Buhari, and now President Bola Tinubu. I have found over the years that certain functionaries may not always agree with our findings, but we publish what we find nonetheless, and they know we are credible. I say this because sometimes our findings may come across as if we are anti-government or anti the political party in power; but the fact is that we are pro-Nigeria. We speak truth to power using hard, credible, scientifically researched data.

Thirdly, as a member of the National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), I am committed to Nigeria’s long-term development. As you may be aware, our motto is ‘Towards a Better Society’; and once you’ve been through the Senior Executive Course (SEC) or even any of the short courses there, your orientation has been reshaped from that of a complainer or problem-identifier to a solution provider for the nation. In essence, we do not just bear mni after our names for nothing; it comes with a lifetime obligation of service to Nigeria.

Finally, let me state that as opposed to the rather negative reports shared in the media regarding the state of social cohesion in Nigeria, there are quite a lot of positive findings from the 2025 study showing that Nigeria has made quite some progress, especially in comparison with the previous government, and they need to be highlighted further.

This is interesting to hear. Can you shed light on some of the positive findings from the social cohesion survey?

Nigeria has made some progress in improving the state of social cohesion under President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. First, the Nigeria Social Cohesion Index was calculated as 46.8 per cent. Although this is still under the average threshold of 50 per cent, it is a 7.2 percentage point improvement from the 2022 score, which stood at 39.6 per cent. Secondly, we have also observed improved attitudes among citizens in several areas. For example, in the area of how united or divided Nigeria is today, the data reported that 76 per cent stated that the country is much more divided today, compared to four years ago.

This percentage may seem high, but it represents an 11-percentage point decrease from the 2022 score of 87 per cent, indicating that fewer people currently believe the country is much more divided today under the administration of President Tinubu, compared to that of President Buhari. Also, in the area of Gender Equity, there is a glimmer of hope when you see the data. For instance, 63 per cent say they would be willing to vote for a woman as president of Nigeria; 69 per cent would be willing to vote for a woman as governor of their state; and 76 per cent would be willing to vote for a woman as their local government chairperson. In addition, 79 per cent of citizens believe that qualification and competence should be the primary focus, rather than gender, when considering individuals for public positions; 75 per cent believe that people should be paid according to their competence, not their gender; and 73 per cent agree that women should have equal entitlement to family inheritances.

These findings suggest an increasing openness for women to hold top political offices and acceptance that women can occupy prominent political roles beyond just voting. Additionally, 87 per cent believe that boys and girls should have equal access to education, which is a very positive development. As you can see, we’ve made some progress in certain areas, and it is essential that we highlight them

From the data, in what areas of social cohesion is Nigeria still lacking as a country?

Based on the data, there are several areas that require a lot more work to achieve. For instance, areas of identity and trust remain significant concerns. On the issue of identity, the data reported that more Nigerians have a proclivity towards ethnicity than nationalism. You see, one of the questions on the survey asks citizens how they see themselves. It asks whether they see themselves as Nigerians or first from their respective ethnic origins. The literature suggests that the more citizens perceive themselves as Nigerians first, the more socially cohesive the country is.

However, if citizens identify themselves primarily by their ethnicity, then the country becomes less cohesive.

The data suggests that over the last decade, citizens have tended to identify more by ethnicity and less by nationality – identifying as Nigerians first. So, there’s a lot that needs to be done to ensure that citizens put Nigeria first – that strong national identity that citizens are proud of and can give their lives for.

You know, Western countries were established on the back of nationalism. Men and women came together to pledge their allegiance to their country, even to the point of going to war to defend the country. My point is that we need to do more to entrench a national identity that serves as a rallying point for all citizens, regardless of their tribe, language, religion, age, and gender. Just as our national anthem states, though tribe or tongue may differ, in brotherhood we stand.

The second big elephant in the room is the issue of trust. The data reported significant erosion in citizens’ trust towards government and public institutions. Since the country’s return to democratic rule, citizens’ trust in the government has continued to erode, and this trend has become more pronounced over the past decade, first under President Buhari and now under President Tinubu. In fact, the 2023 election dealt a terrible blow to Nigeria in the sense that it created serious divisions in the country, especially religious and ethnic tension, and that has deepened the fault lines and even eroded trust among citizens. And this should have been the first task for the President the moment he assumed office. He should have introduced policies to reunite the country first and rebuild the bonds of love, togetherness, and mutual trust. And this should have been reflected in his appointments as well, but we all know what citizens are saying about the appointments.

How important is the Social Cohesion Survey data to driving development in Nigeria?

One of the top scholars of social cohesion in the literature, Langer, describes the concept as the glue that holds society together. When there is no glue holding the society together, you know what would happen to it. Agitations here and there; clamour for secession; rise in crime and nefarious activities; calls over perceived marginalisation and all that. So, do you understand why we have IPOB and the rest, the North saying they have been marginalised in terms of public appointments, the West saying their forests have been taken over, and the Niger Delta activists having their own agitations? They are all symptomatic of the weak glue holding the country together.

That is the importance of social cohesion. Do people have a sense of belonging in the country or do they see the country as we versus them? Do they trust those in government? Do they even trust fellow citizens from other religious divides or other parts of the country? Do they think that all Nigerians are equal under the law, or are there some Nigerians more equal than others?

We talk about multidimensional poverty affecting 76 per cent of the population in a country where some people are saying ‘money na water.’ You talk about our health systems, and you hear anecdotes of how public hospitals lack basic health supplies and medicines to treat citizens, especially in rural areas, such that they have to send some patients away at times. You hear citizens make sarcastic comments like ‘may Nigeria not happen to you.’

These comments all emphasise the role of social cohesion as the glue that holds society together. Therefore, you can’t discuss the development of a country without addressing the issue of social cohesion.

Can you tell us a bit more about the capacity-building workshops organised by API. What were they about and who were the target audiences?

Yes, the essence of our research efforts isn’t just to undertake studies and publish them, but also to engage with key stakeholders. With the support of our donor, Ford Foundation, we were able to enhance the capacity of two groups of stakeholders. First, we had a session with institutions mandated to promote unity, oneness, and cohesion in the country – public institutions like the National Orientation Agency, Federal Character Commission, Nigeria Television Authority, and the rest. We brought them together to expose them to the concept of social cohesion and how to design policies and programmes through the lens of social cohesion data. The second group of stakeholders consisted of media practitioners, including information officers from public institutions and journalists from print and electronic media. Their session focused on how to engage in socially cohesive media reportage. They were both well attended and well-received. Many participants had never heard of the concept of social cohesion, and discussing the indicators measured and the survey findings was considered quite insightful.

What advice do you have for policymakers on the need to imbibe the use of social cohesion data in their policymaking?

Our major thesis is that for Nigeria to make progress, governments at all levels – federal, state, and local – must pay close attention to the subject of social cohesion and understand the implications of the survey findings. Then, they need to begin implementing policies and programmes to promote unity, oneness, peaceful coexistence, and cohesion. That glue holding society together has to be strengthened to build an enduring and sustainable country. Without unity and peaceful coexistence, we cannot make progress as a people. But, of course, the example has to be set from the top. So, we need to see President Tinubu and his administration generally instituting initiatives that are geared towards building national cohesion; then we can see state governors following suit, and local government council chairpersons also introducing local initiatives to promote a sense of belonging, national identity, and trust.

Finally, our politicians need to change their politics of prebendalism and the winner-takes-all approach. They need to put the country first and consider how to ensure that all citizens have a strong national identity and feel a deep sense of belonging, pride, and trust towards Nigeria. I strongly believe our best days are ahead of us.",https://guardian.ng/interview/nigeria-will-be-better-off-without-politics-of-prebendalism-ihua/,https://guardian.ng
Inside Jesse Flames’ world as he releases ‘Flex’ featuring Jesse Jagz,"Singer Jesse Nnaemeka Dibe, popularly known as Jesse Flames, speaks with MUSA ADEKUNLE about his background, the challenges of balancing singing, writing and producing, and his latest single, Flex featuring Jesse Jagz.

Tell us about yourself, your background, including your age, early education, and what growing up was like.

My name is Jesse Nnaemeka Dibe. I’m from Imo State, Nigeria. I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, United States, and I grew up in FESTAC, Lagos, to be precise. I was there for about 16 years. Then I went to London to further my education. I attended Middlesex University to study film production. I also did a mixing and mastering course for music.

I started making music at the age of 11. I loved music from when I was young. My mum was in a choir. I started playing drums in primary school and also the piano, and I just gravitated to music. I officially kick-started my career in 2016 when I dropped a track called Like That and also Double Double.

Why did you go into music, and where did you get the stage name Jesse Flames?

When I was growing up, my brother and sister were always performing music in school. When they came home, I admired them. I also looked up to people like Lil Wayne and Justin Bieber. Since I could play the drums and piano, and also rap, I felt music was the right thing for me.

It was my calling. It was either music or basketball. I was really good at sports, but music was my first love. So, I decided to pursue it properly as a career. I started off as a rapper.

Your songwriting and production feel very seamless. Can you walk us through your creative process from the first idea to the final track?

My creative process is different sometimes. I can be inspired by nature when I am outside. It could be me just recording on my voice notes and later making the beats. Sometimes in the studio, I come up with the beats first, depending on what melody I infuse.

Then I go into the songwriting process. Sometimes it can be the beat first, sometimes it can be the chorus or hook before the beat production. It varies.

You’re about to release Flex featuring Jesse Jagz. Why did you choose this track, and what inspired it, and what mood did you want to create with it?

This track was very effortless, very creative, very unique. We did not even try much. It was organic. Jagz came to my studio. He honoured my invitation. We were just talking, having a few drinks, discussing. Then we started producing.

My producer and I started making the beat from scratch. We played him a couple of beats, like 20 beats. He liked them but did not choose them. It was the one we created from scratch that he gravitated to. From there, we started building the song.

It took me less than five minutes to come up with the chorus. It took him even less than 20 minutes to write his verse. It was very organic.

Why did you choose Jesse Jagz for the collaboration?

I did not think of other artistes. Jesse Jagz is one of my inspirations in the Nigerian music industry. He is a producer like me. He is a lyricist like me. He sings. He infuses melodies the way I do. He is a legend.

I looked up to him from his freestyles back in the day, Tim Westwood, Jesse JTD, Jaggo, and other songs he dropped that inspired me. I always wanted to work with Jesse Jagz, Ice Prince and M.I., the whole Chocolate City. So, it was an honour.

I got the opportunity to work with him through a friend of my brother who knew Jesse Jagz from Jos. I was very happy.

Which other artistes have you worked with in the past?

I’ve worked with Ice Prince. I have a song with him after Flex, it’s called Commander. That’s a hit as well. I’ve worked with Oritse Femi, Mike Magneto and Shmalee. I am yet to work with M.I., but it is in the making.

You released Freaky Baby in May in 2025. What inspired that track and why the title?

Freaky Baby was a club song inspired by how I was feeling after my producer made the beat. I had just come back from the club at around 5.30 a.m. There was a girl I was talking to at that time.

I decided to appreciate her by singing that song. She was bold, sexy, nice and beautiful. I felt she deserved that record.

Afrofusion put you in a global space. How do you blend Afrobeats, R&B and Pop in a way that feels unique to you?

The fusion of my music is natural. Growing up in Lagos, being born in America, and living in London made me very multicultural.

That is why you can hear Pop, R&B and Hip-Hop in my songs. My music blends cultures together. People hear my sound and say they can recognise my style, accent, melodies.

My influences range from Fela Kuti, King Sunny Ade and Osadebe, to Lil Wayne, Drake, Tupac, Biggie, R. Kelly, Usher, Chris Brown, Justin Bieber and even highlife. I listen to everything. I am musically inclined.

How has your background shaped your music and storytelling?

My background shaped me in many ways. Growing up in Nigeria gave me the foundation I needed. It made me street smart. Everybody can relate to that.

Being able to speak Yoruba and Igbo also played a huge role in my music. It helped me craft a diverse sound.

You sing, you write and produce. What is the most challenging part of switching between these roles?

I started in JSS1. Back then, my mum and dad used to give me pocket money. I would save it and sneak out of boarding school to record at a studio in FESTAC where people like Sound Sultan and 2Face used to record.

At one time, a producer collected ₦25,000 from me and refused to give me my song. That money was like ₦200,000 today. That experience pushed me to start producing my own beats.

The challenge is that when you do everything alone, it slows you down. There was a year I only released one song because I had to make the beat, record, mix and master by myself. It was difficult.

Now, I work more with my crewmate Raj Beats who handles the production. I focus on songwriting because juggling all three is very demanding.

What feeling do you want your listeners to take away from Freaky Baby?

I want my listeners to feel my journey. I want them to feel joy and happiness, but also my struggles and emotions. I want them to connect with me through the music.

Can you share a fun or unexpected moment that happened in the studio while recording this song Flex?

The experience on Flex with Jessie Jagz was very natural and organic. Imagine me having the opportunity to host him in my studio through my brother’s friend.

So just going to the studio, making the beat from scratch, creating the chorus, him creating his rap. So it was very fun and playful.

If you are to describe this song in just one word, what would that be?

Legendary.

You have given us Good Intentions EP in the past. What should fans look forward to next?

Fans should expect more music and more features. From the start of my career, I dropped singles mostly by myself. But now, I am focusing on collaborations.

What is your biggest dream in the music industry, and do you see this as long-term?

Music is my life. It is a journey. I see myself doing it till the end of time. Even when I stop singing, I have my label. I will sign new artistes, give them a voice, and inspire the world.

Do you look forward to being signed to a record label?

At the moment, I enjoy being independent. If I ever sign to a major label, it would be a distribution deal where I own my masters, while they share in the success.

How has the journey been, doing everything yourself?

I would not call it lonely, but it has not been easy. People see me at the front, but my brothers and close friends have been supporting me.

I have received many “no’s” but they made me stronger. I have also received many “yes’s.” The industry is not easy, but if you have passion and you stick with it, you will succeed.

My advice is, do not wait for someone to discover you. Push yourself. At the end of the day, it is God who controls everything, not man.

If you have one piece of advice for your younger self, what would it be?

Do not be too harsh on yourself. Every step you take is success. Count the little wins as success too. Stay positive and be optimistic.",https://guardian.ng/interview/inside-jesse-flames-world-as-he-releases-flex-featuring-jesse-jagz/,https://guardian.ng
"Growing intersections of AI, automation, financial services will drive business transformation — Nwanze","Mr. Chukwuma Nwanze is the MD/Chief Executive Officer of Credit Direct Finance Company Limited, one of Nigeria’s leading embedded finance companies. He joined the organisation in 2012 as Head of Strategy and Business Development, where he played a pivotal role in the development of the company’s first Loan Management System, marking the beginning of its digital transformation journey. Over the years, he has held various leadership positions, including Chief Finance Officer and Executive Director of Finance and Strategy. In 2023, he was appointed MD/CEO, bringing over a decade of experience in financial structuring, reporting, and management. Under his leadership, Credit Direct has undergone a significant digital transformation, leveraging artificial intelligence and automation to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency. The company has introduced innovative products such as the Credit Direct Mobile App, CLARA (an AI-powered assistant), and the Buy Now, Pay Later solution, positioning itself as a digital-first financial technology company. Mr. Nwanze holds a Bachelor of Business Administration from Cambridge International College and is a Doctoral candidate in Business Administration at Edinburgh Business School, Heriot-Watt University. He speaks with GREGORY AUSTIN NWAKUNOR on his commitment to fostering a culture of innovation, excellence, and empathy within the organisation, aligning with Credit Direct’s mission to ensure access to financial solutions as a universal opportunity.

So, looking at FinTech in Nigeria, what trend do you foresee shaping the future of embedded finance and digital learning?

I believe FinTech is rapidly becoming a buzzword. In the next five years, I doubt we will even refer to them as FinTech companies, as every financial instrument will inherently be digitally specific. Every financial instrument will embody FinTech, driven by seamless Application Programming Interface (API)-led integrations where systems and platforms communicate effortlessly. We anticipate intelligent, swift, and astute decision-making as AI becomes deeply embedded across every facet of finance, fostering more inclusive lending.

This will enable on-the-spot credit decisions, irrespective of their complexity. The growth of embedded finance will be significant, with Credit Direct proudly leading this charge not only in Nigeria but across Africa. We foresee a surge as finance becomes seamlessly incorporated into everyday living. This transformation is set to unfold rapidly in the coming years. Furthermore, I anticipate substantial growth in financial inclusion, directly linked to the increasing smartphone penetration and internet accessibility in Nigeria. As the world becomes increasingly mobile, the FinTech space will witness considerable activity and innovation.

Since your appointment as MD/CEO in 2022, what have been the most transformative changes you have driven at Credit Direct?

I have been with Credit Direct for 13 years in total, including the decade prior to my CEO appointment. The transformative changes since my appointment are a continuation of the excellent work initiated by my predecessor and the dedicated team, a legacy I am immensely proud to have inherited and built upon. My primary responsibility has been to digitally transform Credit Direct, a mission that has yielded significant milestones over the past two and a half years.

Firstly, we have diversified significantly beyond traditional lending, now offering digital payments, retail investments, and widely available embedded finance solutions. Our all-in-one mobile app, launched earlier this year, already serves over 200,000 customers, and we are targeting one million users within the next few months. We have fundamentally reorganised as a digital-first business, ensuring all our verticals—lending, payments, and investment—are digitally centric. We operate as an essentially paperless organisation; one would be hard-pressed to find a printer here, reflecting our commitment to this aspiration. We have now integrated digital technology into every aspect.

Our customers can access credit in as little as two minutes today. For instance, individuals dialling *5120# receive funds instantly, while those utilising our WhatsApp channel gain access within minutes. Similarly, accessing credit via mobile or web is equally swift. Our ‘buy now, pay later’ solutions, for example, enable customers to purchase devices within seven minutes, allowing them to leave the store with their new phone. These transformational changes have unfolded over the past two and a half years under my leadership. However, equally paramount has been driving the transformation of our people; I firmly believe no organisation can truly thrive without a strong foundation in its human capital.

Our workforce productivity has more than doubled in recent years, a direct result of our efforts to reshape our culture towards enhanced output. This has led to comprehensive business transformation across financial performance, digital offerings, and customer perception. Crucially, we have experienced a profound cultural transformation within our team; as we grow more productive and energised, our values are directly reflected in the overall financial performance of the business.

So let’s look at CLARA. Can you share its impact with us?

Certainly, let me tell you about CLARA, which stands for Credit, Lifestyle, and Revenue Assistant. CLARA emerged from our Innovate Fest programme in 2023, built by a young individual who had just completed their National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). This exemplifies Credit Direct’s inherent culture of bottom-up innovation. As an AI-powered assistant, CLARA aids customers with loan decisions, will soon guide investment choices, and provides answers to all queries related to their Credit Direct journey.

From a business perspective, CLARA has been highly instrumental, significantly enhancing our operations by responding to inquiries 20 times more efficiently than our contact centre agents. While AI is crucial, we ensure CLARA always maintains a human touch. The common query is whether AI will lead to job losses. My consistent response is that for a forward-thinking organisation, AI complements the existing workforce. While acknowledging potential challenges and ethical considerations, I often argue that for a nation like Nigeria, with its young population and high youth unemployment, AI can significantly reduce inefficiencies—performing tasks that might otherwise require 500 people. Therefore, finding the right balance is paramount.

Our aim is to balance leveraging AI for operational efficiency while continuing to create employment opportunities, as AI-driven efficiency facilitates business expansion. Ultimately, we strive to achieve a harmonious balance between technology and humanity.

So, having risen through the ranks from Head of Strategy to the MD/CEO, what leadership thoughts have defined your approach to building a future-ready FinTech company?

A key lesson throughout my 13 years at Credit Direct, from Head of Strategy to CEO, is that strategy alone is insufficient; it is people who make strategy tangible. For any strategy to work effectively, an engaged workforce is crucial. Our recognition as a ‘great place to work’ is a testament to the exceptional people we are blessed with at Credit Direct, who genuinely enjoy their roles.

For leaders, a daily combination of courage, adaptability, and emotional intelligence is paramount. With nearly a thousand diverse employees at Credit Direct, the challenge lies in unifying everyone towards a common direction while preserving individual identity. Our greatness as an organisation stems from individuals being able to truly be themselves while collaborating effectively. Vision is important and powerful, but culture is paramount. We spare no effort in cultivating the right culture, as it integrates our unique experiences without diluting individual identities. When these experiences converge towards a common goal, operations become seamless.

Our business has consistently grown by nearly 90 per cent annually—a rate surpassing most Nigerian financial institutions—which I directly attribute to our people’s culture. Indeed, as Peter Drucker famously stated, “Culture eats strategy for breakfast,” a philosophy central to my leadership.

What would you say in the past two years that you assumed office gives you joy about your performance?

Witnessing the transformation of the business brings me immense joy. What initially seemed a long-term undertaking became achievable through the ambitious targets my team and I set. In just two and a half years, the business I inherited is fundamentally different from what exists today.

It is truly exciting to confidently state that we have digitally transformed this business, crucially, without the organisation losing its soul. We have retained our identity and essence as a collective, transforming the business successfully while achieving outstanding results, all without making our people unhappy.

What’s next for Credit Direct under your leadership?

What is next for Credit Direct? We intend to continue dominating our chosen niche in the financial services industry, committed to realising our vision of becoming Africa’s leading embedded finance business, extending our footprint beyond Nigeria into the broader African continent in the coming months.

We will deepen our focus in new ventures while maintaining our credit-led identity, broadening our spectrum in payments, investments, and other financial services. Beyond being a technology-first organisation, we will lead with artificial intelligence in credit decisioning, driving operational efficiency, and enhancing customer centricity.

What’s your perspective on the growing intersections of AI, automation, and financial services?

The intersection of AI, automation, and financial services is significant. I believe AI can be effectively layered onto automation; the more automated a business, the easier it becomes to fully leverage AI’s benefits. AI itself will become commonplace and highly commoditised in the coming years. Its applications today are vastly different from two or three years ago, and I am confident that within five years, it will be so normalised, we may even refer to it by another name. However, technology evolves incredibly quickly.

From simple automation, we saw machine learning, then robotic process automation. Ultimately, systems and technologies will become far smarter. They will not only mimic human wisdom but surpass it. Businesses must leverage this new knowledge for efficiency, though always within safe governance frameworks. Crucially, as Africans, we must not misuse artificial intelligence, as our societal narratives differ from those of the Western world. For example, while Norway or Sweden contend with ageing populations, Nigeria faces millions of unemployed graduates and 25 million out-of-school children.

We must find the right balance: participating in global evolution while ensuring AI aligns with our cultural and national realities.

Copying Western contexts is artificial; we must contextualise AI for our specific needs. I believe AI will be amazing, driving business transformation. However, people will always be essential, as everything is imbued with soul, which originates from people, especially within a strong organisational culture. This means embedding financial services—lending, payments, savings, and insurance—into the everyday lives of people and businesses without requiring traditional brick-and-mortar processes or complex financial institutions.

It’s about meeting people where they are, in their communities and marketplaces, where they may not yet have access to these products. Consider this: if you are on a train and run out of money, being able to access credit to complete your journey demonstrates truly embedded finance. It is about integrating finance into everyone’s everyday life.

What sets us apart is our identity as a credit-first, capital-light, and purpose-driven organisation. We have passionately focused on credit for 18 years.

This business, like many others, has only raised capital once in 18 years, proving our capital efficiency and consistent profitability. We achieve this by working through payroll systems, cooperatives, and various e-commerce platforms. By blending technology with our extensive market knowledge, we have consistently provided real value to our customers, dealers, and businesses alike over the years.

So for this past 18 years or so, what has been the most challenging thing that you have faced?

In its 18 years of existence, the organisation has navigated a global financial meltdown and two recessions, building significant resilience. Today, we have served nearly 2 million customers, providing access to credit, payments, and investments for the underserved. The key lesson learned is that the right business approach guides you through difficult times. We have survived turbulent seasons—marked by macroeconomic challenges and unforeseen storms—due to our resilient model and, crucially, the trust our customers place in us. That trust is a byproduct of the value we create.

As a purpose-driven organisation, our focus extends beyond mere profits to making a meaningful impact on our customers’ lives. For instance, some of our customers’ children have gained access to proper education through our facilities. Indeed, I have four colleagues whose parents previously used our services to fund their schooling, demonstrating the full-circle impact when they later joined us as employees. This purpose mindset drives us, ensuring we impact the communities we serve. While profitable, we are committed to ensuring our operating society feels the organisation’s positive impact beyond mere profits.

How is Credit Direct navigating regulatory shifts in the Nigerian financial system?

We are regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria, the apex bank, and I view them as partners in our progress. They introduce the discipline, governance, and security essential for every business. Their frameworks help organisations structure themselves to provide shareholder value and make a meaningful societal impact, which I believe is essential for any successful business.

Regulators, for me, are partners; they compel deep thought into what truly constitutes a good business. Thus, a sustainable and successful business operates with a solid regulator. We are always pleased to be regulated by the Central Bank, as their detailed guidelines make us a better organisation. While some perceive regulatory oversight as overreach, I believe it positions us for future sustainability and helps avoid ‘concern issues.’ That is my perspective.

What role does the Credit Direct Mobile app play in deepening financial inclusion?

Our Credit Direct Mobile app, launched two months ago, already has approximately 200,000 active users. Central to our business is making financial solutions a universal opportunity, with a constant focus on the underserved and underbanked. Our mobile platform is a key channel, enabling the underserved to borrow, save, invest, and grow. Users can achieve decent returns on investments, facilitate daily payments, and access credit for daily life management.

Crucially, access is not limited to hyper-urban areas; individuals in semi-urban and rural regions also benefit. Credit Direct operates in approximately 25 Nigerian states, covering numerous local governments, serving customers beyond urban centres. It is fundamental to our essence to provide digital channels that reach everyone. Beyond the mobile app, our USSD products cater to those without smartphones, allowing credit access via feature phones by dialling *5120#. Most customers using this service can perform numerous transactions via the short code. As a technology-first digital finance company, we prioritise efficient reach over traditional channels, and we observe consistent daily traction.",https://guardian.ng/interview/growing-intersections-of-ai-automation-financial-services-will-drive-business-transformation-nwanze-2/,https://guardian.ng
"‘Work ongoing to revive idle power plants, expand electricity access’","The Managing Director/Chief Executive officer, Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), Jennifer Adighije, in this interview, talks about key reforms deployed within the last year and efforts to bring idle power plants back to life, as well as drive innovative energy solutions that will expand access to affordable, reliable power to be delivered to the last mile. She also highlights commitment to building a stronger, more responsive, and future-ready company, one that is focused not just on generating megawatts but on delivering impact for the country. Excerpts.

This month of August, the new Management team led by you has clocked one year in office. How has it been running the NDPHC?

The past year has been both humbling and inspiring, a period marked by strategic shifts, bold reforms, and visible progress in our efforts to reposition NDPHC as a critical enabler of Nigeria’s energy security. As I mark my first anniversary as the MD/CEO of NDPHC, I do so with a profound sense of gratitude, responsibility, and renewed commitment. From the successful revival and optimization of previously idle power plants to pioneering bilateral power sale initiatives that are already reshaping our revenue base, our journey has been one of action guided by vision and purpose. We have worked tirelessly to restore trust, both within and outside the company, strengthening our regulatory compliance posture and deepening partnerships with key stakeholders, including NERC, TCN, and NISO.



However, the road has not been without its obstacles. We have had to navigate a complex operating environment characterized by persistent liquidity challenges, legacy constraints, inadequate market structures, and systemic inefficiencies in the rapidly evolving national electricity value chain. These challenges, though daunting, have only served to sharpen our resolve and inspire a new level of innovation, resilience, and collaboration across NDPHC. We have leveraged these difficulties as catalysts for reform, pushing forward by developing effective strategies, leveraging relationships, entering strategic Joint Development Agreements (JDAs) with major sector players, and laying the groundwork for smarter, more sustainable energy infrastructure.

Looking back, what would you consider as NDPHC’s major achievements under your leadership in the past year?

Upon assuming office, one of my first priorities was to undertake a comprehensive audit and technical assessment of NDPHC’s generation assets. It became immediately clear that several of our power plants, which are critical national infrastructure, had been either in poor condition or grossly underutilized. The reasons ranged from poor operations and maintenance practices, procurement delays, persistent gas supply issues, to transmission constraints that were left unaddressed for far too long.



Notably, prior to August 2024, power plants such as Ihovbor, Alaoji and Omotosho NIPP were recording Plant Availability Factors (PAFs) below 5%. This level of underperformance translated to not only a significant waste of national resources but also missed opportunities in improving power supply and revenue generation.



In response, the new management under my leadership initiated a well-coordinated and strategic intervention targeting the recovery of idle turbine units. This included engaging OEM vendors, parts suppliers, and building an in-house response team in partnership with service providers to provide a quick response to facilitate recovery and avert downtime while also harnessing commercial relationships with gas suppliers to secure a stable gas supply to the power plants. These actions were deliberate and data-driven, aimed at bringing dormant capacity back on stream as quickly and sustainably as possible.



The results have been both encouraging and measurable. We have successfully recovered five generating turbine units across the fleet, restoring 625MW to active contribution to the national grid. This has contributed to an increase in the available megawatts (MW) for national consumption and improved asset utilization. The ripple effect of this revival is also reflected in improved revenue flow, job satisfaction, and a renewed sense of purpose across our operations. Alaoji Power Plant, which had hitherto remained dormant for an extended period, is now set to come on stream in a matter of weeks, an outcome that is largely attributable to the proactive and strategic efforts of the current leadership. Through focused engagement with key stakeholders, facilitation of gas supply arrangements, and technical readiness assessments, the present management has cleared critical bottlenecks that had previously stalled our plant’s operations. This development marks a significant milestone in NDPHC’s ongoing drive to unlock stranded capacity and inject much-needed power into the national grid.

Most importantly, our reform drive has restored investor, stakeholder, and regulatory confidence in NDPHC’s capacity. This achievement affirms our strategic direction and reinforces our commitment to making NDPHC a central pillar in Nigeria’s energy transition. It is one of the early wins in our long-term journey of institutional revitalization and sectoral transformation.

What’s your position on strategic power sales initiatives?

One of the clear realities I met upon assumption of office was the unsustainable nature of relying solely on the centralized electricity market, which continues to be plagued by chronic revenue shortfalls, market defaults, sectorwide uncertainties and persistent liquidity crisis. These issues have significantly impacted NDPHC’s financial sustainability over the years. To begin reversing that trend, we initiated a gradual but deliberate shift towards bilateral power sales as a more commercially viable pathway.



Over the past year, we have made meaningful progress in identifying and engaging large, creditworthy electricity consumers who qualify as Eligible Customers under the NERC framework. Through structured negotiations and strategic engagement, we are working to establish bilateral agreements that allow NDPHC to sell power directly to these customers at cost-reflective tariffs. This approach, though still a work in progress, is aimed at enhancing our revenue base, improving liquidity, and insulating the company from the inefficiencies of the centralized market.



While we have not yet concluded all the agreements, the process is well underway, and the traction we are gaining is encouraging. It’s a journey that requires strong regulatory alignment, internal restructuring, and customer confidence, but it is a journey we are committed to. These strategic efforts are already repositioning NDPHC as a more agile and commercially responsive entity, with a clearer path toward long-term sustainability and impact.

What were the biggest challenges you met on assumption of office, and how have you addressed them?

One of the most pressing challenges I encountered upon assuming office was the acute liquidity crisis facing NDPHC and other GenCos, primarily caused by the overwhelming debt owed by key market players and some of our cross-border customers. When I took over, the company was burdened with substantial unpaid invoices, resulting in severe cash flow limitations that threatened our capacity to sustain operations, invest in essential infrastructure, and meet our financial commitments.



In addition to the debt burden, there were longstanding operational inefficiencies, dormant generation assets, and weakened stakeholder confidence in NDPHC’s capacity, credibility and industry relevance.



To address these challenges, we took a multi-pronged approach. On the commercial side, we began the process of restructuring our power sales strategy, moving toward bilateral contracts with eligible customers, which would allow us to sell power at cost-reflective tariffs and reduce our reliance on default-prone market channels. This is still a work in progress, but we’re making steady gains. We have successfully tackled key constraints, most notably, gas supply and evacuation limitations, by collaborating strategically to unbottle the bottlenecks.

Equally important was rebuilding operational credibility. We strengthened compliance with regulatory requirements, improved coordination with TCN and NISO, and proactively engaged NERC to align our operations with market expectations.



These challenges, while daunting, also presented opportunities to drive reform, innovation, and strategic repositioning and I believe we are on the right path to delivering a more resilient and forward-looking NDPHC.

What new systems or reforms have you introduced to aid corporate governance and efficiency?

One of my key priorities upon assumption of office was to strengthen internal systems and promote a culture of accountability, transparency, and performance. To this end, we introduced a number of reforms aimed at improving both structural governance and day-to-day operational discipline across the organization.



Firstly, we institutionalized a performance monitoring framework that sets clear KPIs for directorates, which cascades down across departments. This has helped us track delivery timelines, measure output, and ensure greater accountability for results. In addition, we began quarterly performance reviews to assess progress and address gaps proactively.

We also undertook a review of our procurement and financial processes, streamlining approval workflows and ensuring stricter compliance with internal control procedures. This has helped to reduce delays, cut inefficiencies, and enhance the integrity of our procurement system.



On the governance side, we strengthened the role of internal audit and compliance by ensuring more independence in their reporting lines and giving them the support needed to function effectively. We also emphasized documentation, records management, and adherence to board-approved policies, especially around project execution and vendor engagement.

As part of my commitment to transparency and accountability, we have commenced procurement of an ERP tool for enabling organization-wide planning for enhancing operational efficiency. We have also forged a strategic partnership with the EFCC to tackle procurement-related irregularities in NDPHC. This collaboration aims to identify and eliminate fraudulent practices, reinforce due process, and instill a strong culture of accountability. It sends a clear message that we are serious about reform, while also strengthening internal controls and supporting national anti-corruption efforts in the power sector.

Most importantly, we have tried to instill a culture of professionalism and service within NDPHC, one that sees public service not just as routine administration, but as a strategic responsibility to the Nigerian people. These steps may not always make the headlines, but they are foundational to building a more resilient, responsive, and performance-driven NDPHC.

How many additional Megawatts has NDPHC been able to contribute to the national grid in the past year since you assumed the MD position?

I must say that our drive to recover dormant turbine units targets an increase in available power generation/grid capacity. As a result, NDPHC has been able to contribute an additional 625MW to the national grid. This incremental capacity has come largely from Calabar (125MW added), Ihonvbor (250MW added), Omotosho (125MW added), and Sapele (125MW added); these milestones have generally improved sector-wide deliverables and performance metrics, which reflect in the performance report published by the regulator NERC on a quarterly basis.



We see this not just as a technical achievement, but as a testament to the possibilities that exist when leadership is intentional, strategic, and focused on results. And we are not relenting in our goal to sustain and scale this impact in the months and years ahead.

Several of the NIPP power plants have struggled with gas supply and transmission bottlenecks. What practical steps have you taken to resolve these issues?

For transmission bottlenecks, we strengthened our technical collaboration with TCN and NISO. Currently, we are in the process of setting up a joint task framework to ensure that plant availability and dispatch are better coordinated, particularly during periods of grid stress. Additionally, we’ve initiated conversations around embedded and bilateral power solutions to ensure that, where evacuation through the national grid is constrained, we can explore alternatives that allow us to serve Eligible Customers directly.

These are not overnight fixes, but they represent practical, ongoing steps toward making our assets more productive and commercially viable.

Indeed, gas supply and transmission bottlenecks have long been major impediments to the optimal performance of several NIPP power plants. Upon assumption of office, I prioritized these challenges because they directly affect our ability to deliver reliable power to Nigerians and generate sustainable revenue.

On the gas supply front, we engaged directly with key gas suppliers and relevant government agencies to renegotiate and facilitate more reliable supply arrangements. This includes clearing some legacy payment issues, restructuring gas supply agreements to reflect current realities, and establishing stronger coordination mechanisms for monitoring supply consistency. A notable result of this is the improved gas availability to plants like Alaoji and Geregu, which are now gradually coming back to life.

What is the current status of the uncompleted NIPP plants and transmission projects?

The uncompleted NIPP plants and transmission projects have been a major focus of my administration over the past year, and I am pleased to report that we are beginning to see measurable progress across several fronts. One of the most significant milestones is the near completion of Egbema Power Plant, which was at 52% completion when I came on board and now stands at 80%. The contractors on the project, Messrs China Machinery Ltd CMEC, have also presented a progress plan which we are steadily working towards.



At Gbarain, we’ve hit a major milestone, too. This plant, which has erstwhile been offline since year 2020 after a fire incident consumed the power control module. We have succeeded in awarding the contract for the PCM restoration to Tilt/Schneider Electric J.V, which is expected to be completed in 12 months. Other pre-commissioning exercises will also commence parri-passu to enable complete restoration of the plant to the grid by Q4-2026. The plant had been severely limited by gas supply issues, but those are gradually being addressed, allowing the facility to resume meaningful contributions to the grid.



For the transmission projects, cash flow remains the major challenge that impedes progress. These projects are dollar denominated, and till date, NDPHC has been unable to reach meaning agreements on the recoupment of investments valued at about 1,000,000,000,000 (One trillion naira). While challenges remain, we have sought the intervention of the regulator NERC to consider mediating to resolve the long-standing issue.

How is the company managing debts and liquidity issues that have long affected the power sector?

Managing debts and liquidity constraints has been one of the most excruciating challenges since I assumed office as MD/CEO of NDPHC. At the time, the company was heavily burdened by legacy debts, particularly from non-settlement of invoices and market shortfalls, which significantly impacted our operational sustainability. It is, therefore, heartening that the Federal Government under President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has shown strong political will and commitment by pledging to offset the over N4 trillion debt owed to Generation Companies, of which NDPHC is a significant creditor.



To address this, we’ve adopted a multi-pronged approach. First, we intensified our engagement with NERC, the Market Operator, and other relevant institutions to push for improved market discipline and enforcement of payment obligations. At the same time, we have prioritized bilateral power sales as a strategic alternative, targeting creditworthy Eligible Customers who can pay cost-reflective tariffs directly to us. This helps improve our liquidity and reduces reliance on the defective central settlement system.



Internally, we instituted tighter financial controls, enhanced revenue tracking, and pursued aggressive cost-optimization measures across our assets. We’ve also engaged gas suppliers and other creditors to restructure some of our obligations in a way that aligns with our current cash flow realities.



While these measures are ongoing, we are already beginning to see signs of improved liquidity, increased investor confidence, and a gradual return to commercial stability. The ultimate goal is to build a financially resilient NDPHC that can sustain itself, grow strategically, and continue to deliver incremental value to the Nigerian power sector.

Where do you see NDPHC in the next five years under your leadership?

Over the next five years, I envision NDPHC evolving into a commercially sustainable, technologically advanced, and socially impactful power generation company. One that not only contributes significantly to Nigeria’s energy mix but also drives sector-wide performance through innovation.

We are working towards deepening our participation in bilateral power sales, expanding our renewable energy footprint, enhancing the reliability of our assets through digitization and automation, and building a virile human capital base that is not only technically competent but also strategically aligned with the company’s evolving mission. I also see us becoming a key driver of industrialization through our strategic partnerships and targeted projects in commercial clusters like Agbara, Mowe, Challawa and others, which will reduce reliance on imports and create jobs.

Equally important, I want NDPHC to become a model for transparency, efficiency, and stakeholder trust, serving as a Federation company that delivers value to both the government and the Nigerian people. The next five years will be about unlocking the full potential of our assets, our people, and our mandate.

What message would you like to send to Nigerians about the NDPHC’s role in addressing the nation’s power challenges?

To my fellow Nigerians, I want to assure you that the Niger Delta Power Holding Company remains fully committed to being a central part of the solution to Nigeria’s power challenges. We understand the frustration that comes with unreliable electricity, and we do not take our responsibility lightly.

Under my leadership, we are working tirelessly to optimize existing assets, bring idle power plants back to life, and drive innovative energy solutions that will expand access to affordable, reliable power to be delivered to the last mile. We’re also pursuing reforms that ensure financial stability and accountability across the value chain.



NDPHC may not solve all the sector’s problems alone, but we are determined to lead with integrity, technical excellence, and a deep sense of national duty. Together with our partners and stakeholders in government and the private sector, we are building a power sector Nigerians can be proud of—one project, one reform, and one community at a time.

As you reflect on your first year as the MD/CEO of NDPHC, what are the lessons learnt?

As I reflect on my first year as the MD/CEO of NDPHC, I am deeply humbled by the progress we’ve made, despite the enormous challenges we’ve had to confront. From reviving dormant power plants and expanding our commercial operations to initiating bold partnerships and enhancing governance structures, our performance has been marked by purposeful steps toward sustainable transformation.

The road hasn’t been easy; debt overhangs, gas constraints/receivables escalating, transmission bottlenecks, and systemic inefficiencies have tested our resolve. But within these challenges, we’ve found fresh opportunities: to innovate, to collaborate, and to rethink how NDPHC builds resilience and delivers value to the Nigerian power sector.

Looking ahead, I remain optimistic. We are building a stronger, more responsive, and future-ready company, one that is focused not just on generating megawatts but on delivering impact. Our outlook is clear: deepen reforms, drive innovation, and ensure NDPHC becomes a central pillar in solving Nigeria’s power challenges. I thank all our stakeholders, partners, and my dedicated team for walking this path with me. The journey continues with renewed vision and unwavering commitment.",https://guardian.ng/interview/work-ongoing-to-revive-idle-power-plants-expand-electricity-access/,https://guardian.ng
AI + Sustainability = Prosperity: Nigeria’s next big leap,"For decades, Nigeria’s definition of prosperity has been tied to oil revenues and traditional employment. But the world has changed. Oil is no longer destiny. Jobs, as we know them, are being reshaped by technology. For Nigeria to thrive in the 21st century, we must rewrite the equation of prosperity.

That equation is simple: AI + Sustainability = Prosperity.

The Power of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not science fiction. It is the engine already powering global finance, agriculture, logistics, and even governance. Nations that understand this will leap ahead; those that don’t will fall behind. AI helps us do more with less — whether that’s predicting crop yields, managing financial risks, or improving public services. It multiplies human capacity.

Nigeria cannot afford to sit on the sidelines. To ignore AI is to accept a future of dependency. To embrace it is to claim a future of possibility.

The Necessity of Sustainability

But AI alone is not enough. Without sustainability, intelligence becomes short-sighted. Nigeria faces enormous challenges in food security, energy access, and environmental degradation. Today, we waste nearly half of our farm produce due to poor logistics and lack of cold storage. We rely heavily on diesel generators that drain incomes and poison the air.

Sustainability is not about slogans; it is about survival. It is about building systems that work for generations, not just for election cycles.

The Path to Prosperity

When we combine AI with sustainability, we unlock a new pathway for Nigeria’s prosperity. Imagine AI-driven cold storage hubs that cut food waste by half. Imagine solar-powered grids optimised by intelligent software that ensure 24/7 electricity without diesel. Imagine government services that predict needs before crises hit.

This is not fantasy. It is within reach if we have the vision and courage to act.

As Convener of Transcend Naija, I believe Nigeria’s next era of prosperity will not come from oil rigs or job quotas. It will come from our ability to harness intelligence and sustainability together.

The equation is clear: AI + Sustainability = Prosperity.

The only question is whether we will solve it in time.",https://guardian.ng/technology/tech/ai-sustainability-prosperity-nigerias-next-big-leap/,https://guardian.ng

Guardiola puts Haaland above Isak in list of world’s top strikers,"Manchester City's Norwegian striker #09 Erling Haaland applauds at the end of the English Premier League football match between Brentford and Manchester City at the Gtech Community Stadium in London on January 14, 2025.

Pep Guardiola said Erling Haaland is “a little bit above” Alexander Isak as the Manchester City boss responded to Arne Slot’s claim that Liverpool’s new signing was “maybe the best striker in the world”.

Isak could make his Liverpool debut at Burnley on Sunday after the Sweden star completed a British-record £125 million ($169 million) move from Newcastle on transfer deadline day.

Liverpool manager Slot hailed Isak’s quality after the 25-year-old trained with the Premier League champions for the first time this week.

But his suggestion that Isak could be the world’s best did not go down well with City boss Guardiola.

Haaland has scored 88 times in 100 Premier League games for City since signing from Borussia Dortmund in 2022, helping them win two Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FA Cup.

Isak moved to Newcastle from Real Sociedad in 2022 and scored 54 goals in 86 league appearances, helping the Magpies end their 56-year trophy drought by winning the League Cup last season.

Guardiola was quick to back Haaland as the cream of the crop on Friday.

“A little bit above,” he said of Haaland. “Isak is an exceptional player. You asked me about Erling and he is top.

“Isak must be a top player because of what they paid. Another one would say (Kylian) Mbappe, another (Lionel) Messi, Cristiano (Ronaldo).

“I wouldn’t change Erling for anyone. I know him. I like him.”

Guardiola will need Haaland at his predatory best as City seek to get back on track in Sunday’s Manchester derby after successive defeats against Tottenham and Brighton.

After a disappointing third-place finish last season, Guardiola hoped his revamped team would hit the ground running but they have been beset by injuries and defensive problems.

– ‘Huge’ Donnarumma –

City have brought in Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris Saint-Germain to replace Ederson, who left for Fenerbahce after eight years in Manchester.

The Brazilian was a mainstay of City’s dynastic run in the Premier League but his form dipped over the past two seasons.

Ederson’s ability to launch attacks with his superb range of passing contrasts with Donnarumma’s more rudimentary skills on the ball, but Guardiola has no concerns about the change.

“I always try to adapt to the quality of the players. I wouldn’t demand Gigi do something he is uncomfortable with,” said Guardiola, who refused to confirm whether Donnarumma or James Trafford would start in goal against United at the Etihad Stadium.

“We are talking about the best goalkeeper I have ever seen with distribution, short and long passes, in Ederson.

“We didn’t take Gigi to do what Ederson has done. Gigi has another quality. He is so tall. He is so huge.

“All the keepers save shots, bring personality to the team and be a big presence. He has done that in the biggest games.”

Guardiola is not worried despite City’s slow start to the season.

“When you change 10 players in four or five months everything needs to be settled, fixed and consistent,” he said.

“We are still doing many good things but we still need to be more consistent than we have been. Step by step we will do it.”",https://guardian.ng/sport/football/guardiola-puts-haaland-above-isak-in-list-of-worlds-top-strikers/,https://guardian.ng
Jackson happy to be ‘wanted’ after leaving Chelsea for Bayern,"New Bayern Munich signing Nicolas Jackson said Friday he was happy to be “where I’m wanted” after joining the German giants from Premier League club Chelsea on a season-long loan.

At his official unveiling in Munich on Friday, the 24-year-old spoke about the “tough times and difficult moments” as his loan deal looked set to fall through days before the transfer window closed.

“In football, there can be a time when you want a change. I spoke to (sporting director) Max Eberl and the coach and they really wanted me to be here, and they loved me.

“And as a player, you want to be there where people want you to be.”

At Chelsea since 2023, Jackson fell down the pecking order after the summer arrivals of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap.

The Senegal striker had arrived in Munich in the lead-up to deadline day to sign on a season-long loan, only to be recalled by Chelsea after an injury to Delap.

Through his agent, Jackson said he would not return to London in order to push through a move to Bayern.

After initially saying they would honour Chelsea’s request, the German club announced Jackson’s signing hours after the transfer deadline closed, having come to an agreement with the Club World Cup winners.

“There were tough times and difficult moments, but I was very confident I would stay here because here is where I want to play and want to be,” Jackson said.

Bayern reportedly agreed to a loan fee of 16.5 million euros ($19 million), the highest loan fee in their history, along with an obligation to buy for 65 million euros.

After the window closed, Bayern powerbroker Uli Hoeness told reporters the underlying conditions to trigger the purchase obligation were purposely made too difficult to satisfy.

“We only need to pay it when he starts 40 games this season. He’ll never do that,” Hoeness said on Tuesday.

Jackson called Hoeness “a legend of the club” but said trying to trigger the obligation was “not my decision, not my focus. My job is just to play on the pitch and score as many goals as I can and help the team win.”

Man Utd probe mystery of missing boots,"Manchester United have launched an investigation into how players’ boots were lost on the way to their Women’s Champions League qualifier in Norway, forcing them to scramble for new ones.

The Red Devils had to buy a number of replacement boots and shin pads from a local shop hours before the first leg of their tie at SK Brann on Thursday, which they lost 1-0.

Shop owner Andre Gullord told the BBC that the club had spent several thousand pounds.

“We are a big store but they were very lucky we had enough boots in stock that were the right size,” Gullord said. “They paid between £200 ($270) and £230 for each pair and £30 for the shin guards.

“We have had the odd player come in because they have left their boots behind but never the entire team.”

Midfielder Lisa Naalsund, who is from Bergen, where SK Brann are based, told Norwegian TV that she had asked her mother to bring some boots to the stadium for her.

“A bag containing some of our players’ boots went missing during the journey to Bergen,” said a United spokesman.

“We are investigating how this happened. In the meantime, we have secured new boots for all the affected players.”

United will hope to turn the tie around in next week’s second leg as they seek to reach the group stages of the Women’s Champions League for the first time.",https://guardian.ng/sport/football/man-utd-probe-mystery-of-missing-boots/,https://guardian.ng
Chelsea’s Delap out for up to three months – Maresca,"Enzo Maresca says Liam Delap might be out until early December

Chelsea striker Liam Delap could be sidelined until December after injuring his hamstring before the international break, manager Enzo Maresca said on Friday.

Delap signed from Ipswich for £30 million ($40 million) in June and has featured in all of Chelsea’s three Premier League matches so far.

But he was forced off early in the 2-0 win against Fulham on August 30.

“Liam, I think it’s around 10 to 12 weeks, so a long way to go,” Maresca told reporters on Friday.

Chelsea recalled forward Marc Guiu from a loan spell at Sunderland to cover for Delap after Senegal striker Nicolas Jackson left the Blues for Bayern Munich on transfer deadline day.

Maresca also has another forward option in Joao Pedro, who arrived at Stamford Bridge from Brighton in July.

But the Chelsea boss admitted Delap’s injury left him short of forward options ahead of Saturday’s west London derby at Brentford.

“We have the injury for sure now in this moment as a number nine,” he said.

“The only one is Guiu. And Joao (Pedro) also can play there. Against Fulham, we used Tyrique (George) as a nine. So we can also think about him.”

England forward Cole Palmer is nearing a return after missing Chelsea’s victories over West Ham and Fulham with a groin injury and could be involved on Saturday.

But Maresca said there was a question mark over the involvement of Joao Pedro, Estevao Willian and Andrey Santos, all of whom arrived back in England on Thursday after playing in Brazil’s 1-0 defeat to Bolivia.

Moises Caicedo returned late on Thursday following Ecuador’s victory over Argentina.

Brazil’s game took place at an altitude of more than 4,000 metres, creating a further complicating factor in recovery times.

“The three Brazilian players arrived yesterday, they didn’t train, they did some recovery sessions,” said Maresca. “Moises arrived last night. They’re all a question mark for tomorrow.”

Maresca said winger Alejandro Garnacho was “working well” since his arrival from Manchester United but was not yet 100 percent fit.

Chelsea, who won the UEFA Conference League and Club World Cup in Maresca’s first season, sit second in the Premier League after three games this term.

The club were charged by the Football Association on Thursday with 74 alleged breaches of rules related to payments to agents between 2009 and 2022.

The FA said the charges primarily relate to the period between the 2010/11 and 2015/16 seasons when the Blues were owned by Roman Abramovich.

“I know the club are satisfied about the situation, about the process,” Maresca said.

“Personally I don’t have anything to add because I don’t have any idea. If I say something I could be wrong. I just focus on the pitch side, which I can control.

“I don’t think the players are too worried about the situation to be honest.”",https://guardian.ng/sport/football/chelseas-delap-out-for-up-to-three-months-maresca/,https://guardian.ng
Liverpool’s Slot urges patience with Isak after record move,"Arne Slot on Friday described new signing Alexander Isak as “maybe the best striker in the world” but warned he would be eased into action gradually after a disrupted pre-season.

The Premier League champions signed the Sweden forward from Newcastle on transfer deadline day for a British-record fee of £125 million ($169 million), adding further firepower to their impressive squad.

Isak’s arrival after a protracted chase was part of an eye-catching splurge of more than £400 million in the summer transfer window, though a deadline-day move to sign Crystal Palace and England defender Marc Guehi collapsed.

“A lot of things happened on the last day (of the transfer window), which is not always the situation, because last season we hardly did anything during the whole window,” Slot said on Friday.

“But the thing that pleases me most, of course, is us getting the deal for Alex over the line.”

The Dutchman praised Sweden manager Jon Dahl Tomasson for the way he handled Isak’s workload during the international break.

The 25-year-old, who has not played any club football this season, was on the bench for Sweden’s 2-2 World Cup qualifying draw against Slovenia and was brought on as a late substitute in the 2-0 defeat against Kosovo.

“He gets one of the best, maybe the best striker in the world, and needs to play two very important games for his country, but understands that if he would play him twice for 90 minutes, then probably the player would have been injured,” Slot said.

“And that’s not always easy for a manager, that he takes care of the interest of a player, so he deserves a big compliment for that. And we will treat Alex the same as they did, so don’t expect him to be every single game 90 minutes on the pitch.

“That’s definitely not going to happen in the upcoming weeks. He missed a proper pre-season, I think he missed three or four months of team sessions, so now we have to build him up gradually, with us playing so many games, hardly any training time.”

– Isak criticism –

Slot, speaking ahead of Sunday’s match against Burnley, brushed off criticism that Isak received after he agitated to leave Newcastle, where he still had three more years to run on his contract.

“Sometimes people cheer for you, so I think after he won the League Cup (trophy last season), everyone was really happy with him,” he said.

“And in other moments you get criticised — this is part of his life, my life, our jobs. Now he’s a player for us and I’m really happy with that.”

Slot, whose team have won all three of their Premier League matches so far this season, admitted he had been keen to sign Guehi but would not be drawn about any future bid.

“I think it would be a bit ridiculous if I’m going to deny that we were close to signing him,” he said. “That’s so out in the open, that would be ridiculous.

“These things happen in football, it happened to our players maybe in the past as well, that they thought they were so close on signing somewhere else, and then in the last moment things changed.”

Slot, who is eyeing a record 21st English league title with Liverpool, said he had options in defence.

“It’s a pity, not only for us but also for the player, I think,” he said. “But he’s in a good place playing at Palace, where he won the Community Shield and the FA Cup, with a very good manager as well. So let’s see what the future brings for him and for us.”",https://guardian.ng/sport/football/liverpools-slot-urges-patience-with-isak-after-record-move/,https://guardian.ng
Family urges Ondo Govt to stop stool crisis in Ese-Odo,"Family urges Ondo Govt to stop stool crisis in Ese-Odo

The Atike family of Agadagba-Obon in Ese-Odo Local Government Area of Ondo State has called on the State Government to intervene in the crisis over the Amananawei stool to avert breakdown of law and order.

In a statement to newsmen on Friday in Akure, the Ondo State capital, by Ofoyeju Gbinmoye Medek, the family alleged the Kekemeke clan was attempting to impose a traditional ruler on the community despite a subsisting court case on the matter.

Ofoyeju, who is the spokesperson of the family, said the move by the Kekemeke family was “strange, selfish and non-inclusive,” warning that such actions could destabilise the peace of Agadagba-Obon.

It reads: “As a strong stakeholder in Agadagba-Obon, the attitude of the Kekemeke family to single-handedly select and install the Amananawei is a brazen embarrassment to the John Atike family.

“The family will not play second fiddle to any family in the Amananawei issue. So, the Kekemeke family must be called to order as a matter of urgency to forestall peaceful co-existence in the community.”

The family also accused the Kekemeke clan of boasting about political and judicial connections while ignoring peace moves initiated by the Agadagba of Arogbo kingdom, His Imperial Majesty Pere Doubra Zacchaeus Egbunu, Opukutu III.

It alleged that despite the matter being in court, the Kekemeke family had allegedly secured approval to proceed with the selection process.

“In all these, the State Government has not done anything towards reconciliation of the two families.

“Rather, the Kekemeke family succeeds in getting approval to continue with the selection process despite the fact that the matter is already in court. We smell a rat,” the statement added.

The Atike family further alleged plans to attack its members before September 15, the date allegedly fixed for the stool selection, warning that it would resist any provocation.

However, in a petition addressed to the Ondo State Commissioner of Police, the Kekemeke Royal Family accused some members of the Atike family of attempted murder, assault, wilful destruction of property and criminal trespass during the stool selection exercise.

The petition, filed through their counsel, Oju Kekemeke, alleged that thugs led by named members of the Ofoyeju family and others invaded the Atimati Family House on September 2, 2025, where the selection of the Amananawei was being conducted.

It claimed that the attackers made attempts on the lives of Hon. Justice U.P. Kekemeke, High Chief Richard Kekemeke, Prince Beligha Kekemeke and other members of the family, while also destroying chairs, canopies and other property at the venue.

According to the petition, “Hon. Justice U.P. Kekemeke, who was presiding over the meeting as Head of the Ruling House, became an easy target as it took spirited efforts of his Police Orderly and two other Policemen to save his life, even at that, he was dispossessed of his iPad containing very important judicial documents.”

The Kekemeke family stated that the alleged attack which occurred despite the presence of police and DSS operatives, caused panic and disrupted a lawful meeting convened at the instance of the state government.

It urged the Commissioner of Police to launch a full investigation into the incident and bring the perpetrators to justice, stressing that their clients were ready to provide evidence and cooperate fully with the authorities.",https://thenationonlineng.net/family-urges-ondo-govt-to-stop-stool-crisis-in-ese-odo/,https://thenationonlineng.net
"LG crisis: Osun APC reinstated chairmen sue FG, state govt, seek tenure extension to 2028","LG crisis: Osun APC reinstated chairmen sue FG, state govt, seek tenure extension to 2028

Amid the lingering local government crisis in Osun State, the reinstated executives of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have dragged the Federal Government, the Inspector General of Police, the Osun State Government, and others to court, seeking an extension of their tenure beyond its scheduled expiration in October 2025.

The APC officials, elected in October 2022, were sacked by Governor Ademola Adeleke after a Federal Court nullified the election. However, in February 2025, the Court of Appeal reinstated them.

Despite this, PDP members were sworn in as council executives following the February 22 local government poll, leaving both parties claiming control.

Since then, local government workers under the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) have been on strike, while federal allocations remain withheld.

In a fresh suit filed at the Federal High Court, Osogbo (FHC/OS/CS/147/2025), counsel Barrister Muhideen Adeoye, on behalf of Saheed Onibonokuta and seven other local government chairmen, asked the court to extend their tenure until February 19, 2028.

The defendants include the Attorney General of the Federation, the Inspector General of Police, the Osun State Governor, the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, the Osun State Independent Electoral Commission (OSIEC), and the State House of Assembly.

The claimants argued that, under the Constitution and Osun State laws, their tenure should legally commence only from the date they were inaugurated and took their seats as elected council members in February 2025—not from October 2022 when they were first elected but denied office.

They further contended that the conduct of fresh elections in February 2025 during their subsisting tenure was unlawful and an attempt to deprive them of their constitutional right to a full term in office.

The claimants sought for eight reliefs for declaration that OSIEC cannot validly issue a notice of polls, conduct elections into the councils and swear in another set of members during the subsistence of the tenure of office; all steps taken and being taken by the 3th, 4th, 5th and 6th Defendants from the 22nd day of February 2025 and particularly in August, 2025 till date, to force into the Local Government Councils in Osun State some individuals as members of the Councils during the subsistence of the tenure of office of the Claimants is illegal, unlawful, invalid, unconstitutional, null and void.”

They also urged the court that upon a proper interpretation by AGF(1st Defendant) prescribing and curtailing the tenure of office of the Claimants to end in October, 2025 is ultra vires his office, unconstitutional, illegal, null and void only to the extent of his curtailing the tenure of office of the Claimants till October, 2025.

They prayed the court to mandate AGF and IGP to provide needed security to the Claimants to preserve, protect, and enforce their constitutionally and statutorily guaranteed tenure of office till the 19th day of February, 2028, when their three-year tenure will expire by effluxion of time.

They prayed the court to restrain the Governor Ademola Adeleke, Attorney-General of the Osun State, House of Assembly, and OSIEC from taking any step or act to forcefully remove, oust, or force the Claimants out of their offices anytime in October 2025 or thereafter till the 19th day of February, 2028, in their various Local Government Councils.",https://thenationonlineng.net/lg-crisis-osun-apc-reinstated-chairmen-sue-fg-state-govt-seek-tenure-extension-to-2028/,https://thenationonlineng.net
Crisis hits Lagos PDP as George declares party’s deputy national secretary ‘persona non grata’,"Crisis hits Lagos PDP as George declares party’s deputy national secretary ‘persona non grata’

The internal crisis rocking the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has spilled into its Lagos State chapter, as a party Board of Trustees (BoT) member, Chief Bode George, declared Deputy National Secretary, Setonji Koshoedo, ‘persona non grata’ over the handling of ward and local government congresses.

When contacted by The Nation on Saturday, Koshoedo, once backed by several PDP governors and stakeholders as a possible replacement for national secretary, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, an ally of Nyesom Wike, refused to comment, saying, “No comments please.”

In an open letter to PDP national chairman, Ambassador Umar Damagum, and the National Working Committee (NWC), George accused Koshoedo of unilaterally distributing congress nomination forms without consulting state leaders, warning that the divisions that led to PDP’s poor performance in Lagos during the 2023 elections may resurface.

“The old era of manipulation and deceit has ended. Members of the public are watching the party, and our actions must always be above board. We must be just, fair, and equitable,” George wrote, stressing that Lagos, Nigeria’s largest voting state, risks political upheaval if urgent steps are not taken.

He alleged that some nomination forms were given to individuals who are no longer active members of the party and cautioned that Koshoedo’s position at the national level does not make him the PDP leader in Lagos.

George insisted that the PDP NWC must intervene immediately to ensure fairness, equity, and peace in Lagos, warning that failure to do so could lead to fresh crises, court actions, and further weakening of the party in the state.

“We are firing this early warning shot to Hon. Koshoedo to prevent actions that will lead to political upheaval in the State. We are forced to declare him a political persona non grata in the State due to his actions,” George stated.",https://thenationonlineng.net/crisis-hits-lagos-pdp-as-george-declares-partys-deputy-national-secretary-persona-non-grata/,https://thenationonlineng.net
"Emir Sanusi hails UK for promoting tolerance, religious harmony","Emir Sanusi hails UK for promoting tolerance, religious harmony

The Emir of Kano, His Royal Highness Dr. Muhammad Lamido Sanusi II, has praised the British Government and people for fostering tolerance, maturity, and diversity that allow different faiths to coexist peacefully in the United Kingdom.

Speaking over the weekend in London at a fundraising event for the Old Kent Road Mosque and Islamic Cultural Center, organized by the Muslim Association of Nigeria UK (MAN UK), Sanusi commended the group for its vision of promoting integration and hope for the Muslim Ummah.

“The British Government and people have shown the Muslim Ummah what Islam stands for as a religion of peace, creating an enabling environment for diversity, tolerance, love, respect, and harmonious coexistence regardless of religion or race,” he said.

The Emir stressed that mosques are more than places of prayer—they are centers for knowledge, morals, and social values that shape better societies. He noted that Prophet Muhammad (SAW) welcomed Christians into the mosque, underscoring its role as a symbol of tolerance and unity.

Sanusi also highlighted the significance of the Old Kent Road Mosque project, which will serve not only as a place of worship but also as a hub for education, business, social programs, and sustainable energy through solar power.

“This mosque project stands as a symbol of hope for the Muslim Ummah and humanity in the heart of London, inspiring generations yet unborn,” he said.

He added, “This mosque is built in the true spirit of how the Holy Prophet Muhammad (SAW) enjoined us to build mosques at the heart of communities where people of different nationalities gather together. I have no doubt that this mission of rebuilding the mosque will be achieved, and we shall encourage all those who need to be encouraged to see its completion.”

The Special Guest of Honor, the Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Nigeria, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, in his address, said, “I am very happy and my heart is full of gratitude to our Muslim brothers and sisters for this Old Kent Road Mosque project. I must thank the organisers, the Muslim Association of Nigeria UK (MAN UK), for putting this together.”

Dr. Hamzat stressed that over the past three decades, the Old Kent Road Mosque has become not just a place of worship for Nigerian Muslims and other Muslims in London, but also a beacon of hope, unity, and social interaction at the heart of the city.

He described the event as marking thirty years of an institution embodying the true spirit of Islam, fostering community cohesion, nurturing faith, and serving humanity. He noted that the mosque’s role extends beyond prayers to include services such as Islamic counseling, savings advice, youth and elders’ engagement, and educational programmes that nurture the knowledge and values of future generations.

He emphasized that the decision to rebuild and expand the mosque into a modern six-storey facility reflects a grand vision, creating more space for spiritual growth and community development. This, he said, represents the global arm of the Muslim Ummah in the United Kingdom, addressing the needs of a growing congregation.

Dr. Hamzat concluded that the project is a testament to Nigerian Muslims in the diaspora and a call for solidarity:

“This is an opportunity for all Muslims to demonstrate unity, charity, and brotherhood in uplifting our faith, spirit, and community.”

The Guest Speaker at the event, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, CON, CFR, Registrar of the Nigerian Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), represented by Dr. Hassan Oloyede, congratulated the Muslim Association of Nigeria UK (MAN UK) for the vision of rebuilding the Old Kent Road Mosque and Islamic Cultural Center in London.

Prof. Oloyede expressed gratitude for the invitation, reaffirming his commitment to the mission and vision of the project. He noted that the mosque is not merely a building of brick and mortar but a profound symbol of faith, identity, and community.

He further stated that the mosque has always served as a premier center for education and knowledge. In the contemporary era, he said, its educational role is more critical than ever, and mosques must reclaim this legacy by establishing structured educational programmes for all ages.

He recommended Quranic and Arabic classes for children, study circles (Halaqas) for youth and adults on Islamic jurisprudence, theology, and history, and pre-marital and family counseling workshops. By doing so, he said, the mosque would remain the primary source of authentic religious knowledge, protecting the community from ignorance and misinformation.

Earlier, in his welcome address, the chief host and President of the Muslim Association of Nigeria UK (MAN UK), Alhaji Abdul Jeleel Oladejo, welcomed everyone to the historic gathering.

Alhaji Oladejo noted that the mosque is not just a structure but a legacy of transformation, rebuilding a long-standing center into a modern six-storey multipurpose facility that will serve the community in new and greater ways.

He emphasized that the Old Kent Road Mosque project is about building a future where children can thrive, youths can find purpose, elders feel honored, and the entire community is spiritually and socially uplifted for the sake of Almighty Allah, with benefits in this life and the hereafter.

Other notable speakers at the gathering included Prof. Shaykh Abdal Hakim Murad, Founder and Dean of the Cambridge Muslim College; Councilor Yasmine Dar, former Lord Mayor of Manchester City Council; Dr. Muhammad Wajid Akhter, Secretary-General of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB); Dr. Taofeeq Abdul Salam; Shaykh Yusuf Kamara; and Alhaja Ramatalahi Faruq Onikijipa, who all lent their voices in support of this beacon of hope in the cause of Almighty Allah to see the completion of the Mosque before 2026 Ramadan.",https://thenationonlineng.net/emir-sanusi-hails-uk-for-promoting-tolerance-religious-harmony/,https://thenationonlineng.net

"Air Peace reacts to NSIB report on crew testing positive for drugs, alcohol","Air Peace reacts to NSIB report on crew testing positive for drugs, alcohol

…says no official report from NSIB on test result

The management of Air Peace airline has reacted to the Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau (NSIB) report concerning its Boeing 737-524 aircraft, with registration 5N-BQQ, involved in an incident on July 13 during a Lagos–Port Harcourt flight.

According to the NSIB, toxicology tests revealed that members of the flight crew tested positive for alcohol consumption, while a cabin crew member tested positive for THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis.

The aircraft, carrying 103 passengers, had landed long on runway 21 after an unstabilised final approach.

In its response, Air Peace expressed shock that, more than a month after the incident, it had not received official communication from the Bureau regarding the findings.

The airline reaffirmed its commitment to safety, transparency, and compliance, stressing that it enforces strict policies on alcohol and drug use.

Air Peace emphasised that its rules completely prohibit drug use and mandate stricter alcohol restrictions for crew members than the standard eight-hour pre-flight requirement.

The NSIB stated that the results are still under review within the human performance and safety management components of the investigation.

This was disclosed in a statement by the Bureau’s Director of Public Affairs and Family Assistance, Mrs. Bimbo Oladeji.

The statement reads, “The Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau (NSIB) has released the preliminary report on its ongoing investigation into the serious incident involving a Boeing 737-524 aircraft, with nationality and registration marks 5N-BQQ, operated by Air Peace Limited.

“The incident occurred on 13 July 2025 at Jeremiah Obafemi Awolowo International Airport, Omagwa, Port Harcourt, Rivers State.

“The aircraft, operating as a scheduled domestic flight from Lagos to Port Harcourt with 103 persons on board, landed long on Runway 21 after an unstabilised final approach.

“The aircraft touched down 2,264 metres from the runway threshold and came to a final stop 209 metres into the clearway. All passengers and crew disembarked safely, and no injuries were reported.

“Initial toxicological tests conducted on the flight crew revealed positive results for certain substances, including indicators of alcohol consumption”.

The statement continues: “A cabin crew member also tested positive for THC, the psychoactive component in cannabis.

“These results are being reviewed under the human performance and safety management components of the investigation.

“The NSIB has issued immediate safety recommendations for Air Peace Limited to strengthen crew resource management (CRM) training, particularly in handling unstabilised approaches and go-around decisions, and to reinforce internal procedures for crew fitness-for-duty monitoring before flight dispatch”.

The Bureau while noting that the report represents early findings and is subject to further analysis, added that the final report will present detailed conclusions and additional recommendations to enhance aviation safety in Nigeria.

Responding to the report, the airline stated that it grounded the captain involved for failure to adhere to Crew Resource Management (CRM) principles and disregarding standard go-around procedures advised by the co-pilot.

The statement by the airline reads: “Our attention has been drawn to media stories on a purported preliminary report by the Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau (NSIB) currently circulating online and in the media regarding the incident involving one of our aircraft at Port Harcourt on July 13, 2025.

“We are yet to receive any official communications from the NSIB on such findings over a month after the incident and after the testing of the crew for alcohol which took place in less than an hour of the incident!

“As a responsible airline, we place utmost priority on safety, transparency, and compliance, and it is important to set the record straight.

“Air Peace conducts frequent alcohol and drug tests on our crew. We have a very strict alcohol use policy that is stricter than the 8 hours before the flight as provided in the regulations. Drug use is a no-no!

“Following the incident, we took immediate and decisive action:

The captain of the affected flight was grounded and relieved from further flight duty till date for failure to adhere to Crew Resource Management (CRM) principles and for disregarding standard go-around procedures as advised by his co-pilot but not for testing positive to breathalyser test as the result was not communicated to us by NSIB to date”.

The statement continues: “Contrary to reports in the media, the First Officer (Co-pilot), who demonstrated professionalism in calling for a go-around to his captain, has been reinstated into active flying duties, with full approval from the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA).

“The NCAA cleared him. If he was involved in drug or alcohol use, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority would not have cleared him to resume flight duties.

“However, if the relieved captain tested positive to the breathalyzer test, then we must increase the frequency of our alcohol and drug tests on our crew.

“Again, the importance of Enhanced Crew Resource Management Training can not be over emphasized.We will intensify strict Fitness-for-Duty checks and Stronger Internal Monitoring to prevent any breach of our zero-tolerance safety policy.

“Air Peace has consistently maintained a strong safety record and strictly implements global best practices in all aspects of its operations, and we reassure our esteemed passengers and the Nigerian public that safety will never be compromised in Air Peace”.",https://thenationonlineng.net/air-peace-reacts-to-nsib-report-on-crew-testing-positive-for-drugs-alcohol/,https://thenationonlineng.net
"Court okays DSS’ request for accelerated trial of terror suspect, Al-Barnawi, four others","Court okays DSS’ request for accelerated trial of terror suspect, Al-Barnawi, four others

A Federal High Court in Abuja has granted the request by the Department of State Services (DSS) for accelerated hearing in the ongoing trial of terror suspects, Khalid Al-Barnawi and four others accused, among others, of being behind the August 26, 2011 bombing of the United Nations building in Abuja.

Justice Emeka Nwite granted the request while ruling on Friday on an application filed by the DSS through its lawyer, Alex Izinyon (SAN).

Al- Barnawi was arrested by the DSS in April 2016 in Lokoja, Kogi State, five years after the attack on the Abuja UN building, the first of such attack on an international agency’s property in the country, which left over 20 individuals dead and over 70 others injuried.

While moving the application on Friday, Izinyon said the request for speedy hearing was informed by the prosecution’s readiness to ensure that the case is promptly determined.

By the application, which was not objected to by defence lawyers, parties are to watch video recordings tendered by the DSS in the ongoing trial-within-trial to prove that the defendants’ extrajudicial statements were made voluntarily.

The defendants had claimed they were compelled to make the statements, which informed why the court is now conducting trial-within-trial.

The video clips will be played in the presence of the court Registar and parties will take notes after which they will return to the court on the 23rd and 24th October for continuation of trial within trial.

The main trial had begun shortly after his arrest in 2016 in Lokoja. However, several legal and administrative issues had stalled the trial.

Al- Barnawi known as Kafuri/ Naziru/Alhaji Yahaya/Mallam Dauda/Alhaji Tanimu, is believed to be a founding member of Jama’at Ahl as-Sunnah lid Da’wah Wa’l-Jihad, the Boko Haram Islamist terror group, before he became the leader (Amir) of the break-away faction, Jama’at Ansarul Muslimim Fi Biladi Sudan (JAMBS).",https://thenationonlineng.net/court-okays-dss-request-for-accelerated-trial-of-terror-suspect-al-barnawi-four-others/,https://thenationonlineng.net

Actor Ugezu J. Ugezu has stated that paying a woman’s school fees or assisting her personal growth doesn’t automatically guarantee marriage.

According to his post on Instagram, supporting a woman financially is part of life’s duties that men should undertake without expecting marriage as a reward.

Ugezu stated that relationships and marriage should be built on love, respect, and mutual agreement, rather than financial obligations.

He advises men to respect a woman’s decision if she chooses not to continue a relationship, encouraging them to move on and focus on the future.

Life, he said, is full of new opportunities, and men should approach relationships with patience, maturity, and faith.

He wrote: “That you paid the school fees of a maiden and assisted financially in shaping her life does not mean you must marry her. There are things a man must do and leave for the universe.

Comparison of weddings childish,"Comparison of weddings childish – Actress Biodun Okeowo

Actress Biodun Okeowo popularly known as Omoborty has spoken out about the trend of comparing celebrity weddings, calling it a childish act.

Omoborty on Instagram argued the grandeur of a wedding doesn’t determine the success of a marriage.

Her opinion comes after fans compared the recent weddings of Mr. Eazi and Temi Otedola to that of Davido and Chioma, with many throwing jabs at Davido and praising Mr. Eazi’s wedding.

According to her, wealth and taste are two different things, and what truly matters is the love and commitment between the couple.

She added that everyone has the right to celebrate their wedding in their own unique way, whether simple or extravagant, noting that some couples even go into debt to fund their dream wedding.

In her view, comparing weddings is childish and unnecessary, as it’s the couple’s happiness that truly matters.

She wrote: “Money can decorate a hall but it can’t decorate marriage. So let’s stop confusing money with taste. They are not the same thing. The level of a wedding doesn’t equate to the success of the marriage.

“Wealth or no wealth does not decide taste. Some like it simple, some extravagant, some in between. A party does not prove riches, it reflects personality. Rich or poor, people have the right to celebrate in their own style. Comparing weddings and arguing whose is better is childish. What exactly are people going to do with the ratings?

“An intimate wedding does not mean there is no money and elaborate wedding does not automatically prove wealth. Some even go into debt just to have the lavish wedding of their dreams. Marriage for most happens once, so the wedding should be the couple’s dream, done in whatever way they choose, without having any right to water down their joy or make comparison”.",https://thenationonlineng.net/comparison-of-weddings-childish-actress-biodun-okeowo/,https://thenationonlineng.net

"SAN gives CNA ultimatum to facilitate Natasha’s resumption or face contempt, other charges","SAN gives CNA ultimatum to facilitate Natasha’s resumption or face contempt, other charges

A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Michael Jonathan Numa, has given the Clerk to the National Assembly, Kamoru Ogunlana a five-day ultimatum to facilitate suspended Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan’s resumption at the Senate or face legal action for contempt and other constitutional breaches in both his personal and official capacity.

Numa of M.J. Numa & Partners LP made this threat in his reply to a letter by the CNA to Akpoti-Uduaghan, in which he told her that despite the expiration of her six months suspension, she cannot resume legislative duties because of the pendency of her case before the Court of Appeal.

Numa, who said he was acting as counsel to Akpoti-Uduaghan, said the CNA’s action amounts to delayed tactics to deny her client access to her office to resume her legislative duties.

He said: “Assuming without conceding that the suspension was valid, it was imposed for a fixed term of six months commencing on 6th March 2025.

“That term expired on or about 6th September 2025. At that point, the Senate became functus officio and lost any power to extend, enlarge, or reinvent the punishment.

“Any attempt to prevent her resumption beyond the expiry of the penalty, amounts to punishing her twice for the same alleged misconduct.

“As Clerk to the National Assembly, you are not an elected member of the Senate. Your functions are purely ministerial: to record, transmit, and implement decisions duly made by the Senate or directed by the courts.

“To the best of our client’s knowledge, no Senate resolution exists extending our client’s suspension or imposing any new sanction from the same alleged misconduct.

“Your letter fails to disclose on whose directive you purported to act. By assuming powers you do not possess, you have acted ultra vires, and placed both yourself personally and your office in contempt of the Constitution and binding judicial orders.

“In light of the foregoing, we hereby demand that you immediately facilitate Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan’s resumption of her legislative duties without further obstruction.

“Take notice that failure to comply by Monday, 15th September 2025, will leave us with no alternative but to initiate proceedings against you personally and in your official capacity.

“Such proceedings will include, but are not limited to: Committal for contempt;

Disciplinary action for breach of the Code of Conduct for Public Officers; Liability for instigating breach of the peace with potential implications for national security; and any other remedies available to our client under the law.

“We strongly advise that you reconsider your untenable stance and comply with the Constitution and extant judicial orders.”

Numa in his letter dated September 10, 2025, and titled: “Re:Re: Notice of Resumption” said the position conveyed by the CNA in his letter referencing sub-judice was untenable.

“The letter reads in part: “We are Counsel to Senator Natasha Hadiza Akpoti-Uduaghan, the duly elected Senator representing the Kogi Central Senatorial District, and on whose behalf we write in response to your above-referenced letter.

“Our client acknowledges receipt of your letter dated 4th September 2025, with reference number NASS/CNA/29/VOL.1/41, wherein you asserted that the Clerk of the National Assembly cannot take any administrative action towards her planned resumption on the ground that the matter is ‘sub judice and until a final judicial pronouncement is taken and the Senate formally reviews the suspension in light of the Court pronouncement.’

“It is either ill-advised or deliberately contrived to deprive our client of the constitutional mandate freely bestowed upon her by the constituents of Kogi Central Senatorial District, and therefore amounts to a politically expedient attempt to subvert the sovereign will of the people.

“It is imperative to restate that our client’s right to resume her parliamentary duties, after the expiration of her fixed-term suspension, is rooted in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and cannot be abridged by administrative fiat or internal Senate maneuverings.

“Sections 68 and 69 of the Constitution circumscribe the limited circumstances under which a Senator’s seat may be declared vacant. Nowhere does the Constitution empower the Clerk or even the Senate itself to, by unilateral action, extinguish the sovereign will of the electorate.

“The content of your letter, with respect, amounts to a convenient invocation and misuse of the sub judice rule, tailored to suit the shifting narrative of the Senate leadership.”",https://thenationonlineng.net/san-gives-cna-ultimatum-to-facilitate-natashas-resumption-or-face-contempt-other-charges/,https://thenationonlineng.net
"Ulamas hold prayers for Tinubu’s, Barau’s success in Kano","Ulamas hold prayers for Tinubu’s, Barau’s success in Kano

Ulamas and supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the 44 local government areas of Kano State on Thursday held prayers and animal sacrifice for divine guidance and success of President Bola Tinubu’s re-election.

The gathering also prayed for the Deputy Senate President, Barau Jibrin, to win the governorship election in Kano in 2027.

The spiritual event, held at Gidan Baban Liya, Kurna, Kano municipal, was organised by the Tinubu/Barau/Atah Movement, chaired by Mohammed Sabiu Nuhu.

The group, which tipped the Minister of State for Housing and Urban Development, Abdullahi Yusuf Atah, as Barau’s running mate for APC governorship campaign, explained that the Movement’s mission was to rally political support and solicit votes for the president and senate president ahead of 2027 general election.

Highlight of the occasion was the slaughter of a ram for Allah (God) and a Special Islamic Prayer Session, led by Musa Babaliya, involving hundreds of Ullamas, mosques Imams, women and Qur’an reciting children.

The prayer was for God, who gives leadership, to give the APC leaders electoral victory in 2027, the organisers said.

Speaking to reporters, the Convener, Hon. Seyi Olorunsola said:“We are undertaking this spiritual aspect to have President Tinubu secure his second term election, and for Senator Barau Jibrin to win the governorship seat in Kano in the next election.”

“President Tinubu has done incredibly well in just two years in office; look at the road projects, decline in food prices, employment opportunities and above all his efforts in tackling security challenges.

“In the last few years Nigerians who were crying of insecurity and high prices of essential commodities are now beginning to laugh, as they see real changes.

“We have everything it takes to deliver the president in Kano for the second term. Tinubu is a man of his words, who has kept faith and promises with the people and we are grateful indeed.”

On why Senator Barau Jibrin should fly the APC banner in the state, Olorunsola explained that he is the strongest person who can take over power from NNPP at the polls.

According to him, the Minister of State for Housing (Atah) as Barau’s running mate will be a sure ticket.

“Don’t forget that in the 2023 election we had problems in Kano Central because the current governor, Abba Yusuf, comes from that zone. Thank God, President Tinubu in his wisdom, appointed Yusuf Abdullahi Atah, who is also from Kano Central, as minister of state. Now, Atah, a former Speak of the state, is the best person to checkmate the governor in Kano Central.

“Also, while Kano North has Barau Jibrin with Kano Southern district having Senator Kawu Sumaila, by our calculation, the APC campaign team for 2027 election in Kano will be so formidable that it will cruise to victory with ease,” Olorunsola said.

Also speaking, Saminu Khalid Abdullahi, who is the Sarkin Yaki Matasa, said “the Tinubu/Barau/Atah (TBA) Movement is a new support group established with the objective of mobilising grassroots support for President Bola Tinubu, Barau and Atah, while rallying citizens behind their laudable efforts in governance and nation-building, as we approach the 2027 general elections.”",https://thenationonlineng.net/ulamas-hold-prayers-for-tinubus-baraus-success-in-kano/,https://thenationonlineng.net

"CDS, service chiefs have made tremendous gains in war against terrorism, banditry","CDS, service chiefs have made tremendous gains in war against terrorism, banditry – Agbese

…hails CNS, COAS as outstanding officers globally respected for their performance

The Deputy Spokesperson of the House of Representatives, Hon. Philip Agbese, has lauded the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Christopher Gwabin Musa, and the service chiefs for what he described as tangible and strategic gains in Nigeria’s campaign against terrorism, banditry, and other crimes threatening national stability.

Agbese, who represents Ado/Okpokwu/Ogbadibo Federal Constituency of Benue State, said the current military leadership has reinvigorated counter-insurgency and counter-banditry operations in a manner that is restoring public confidence.

He insisted that recent calls in some quarters for the removal of the service chiefs were “propaganda warfare” from terrorist networks, designed to demoralise troops and distract the public from ongoing successes.

Speaking with journalists on Thursday at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja on his way to an international engagement, the UK-trained lawyer urged Nigerians to resist narratives that weaken the morale of fighting forces.

“The service chiefs have given us clear evidence that Nigeria can win this war. The terrorists and their enablers understand this, so they resort to psychological warfare. Their demand for a change of leadership is not for Nigeria’s benefit — it is a survival tactic for terror,” Agbese said.

He singled out General Musa for praise, pointing to his coordination of joint military operations and his ability to align the different services under a unified counter-terrorism framework.

According to him, the hosting of the African Defence Chiefs’ Summit in Abuja in August was a landmark achievement that showed Musa’s vision extended beyond Nigeria to the continent at large.

“That summit was not just a gathering; it was a statement. Nigeria, under General Musa, showed leadership by convening African militaries to discuss African solutions to African problems,” Agbese said.

Agbese also commended the Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS), Vice Admiral Emmanuel Ogalla, for his determined fight against oil theft, illegal refining, and maritime crime.

He said the Navy’s successes in protecting pipelines and curbing smuggling have translated directly into improved revenue inflows for the government.

“The Chief of Naval Staff has demonstrated uncommon commitment in safeguarding Nigeria’s maritime domain. His leadership in curbing pipeline vandalism, oil theft, and other maritime crimes has not only secured vital national assets but also restored confidence in our waters. Today, illegal oil smuggling is no longer the thriving industry it once was, thanks to his strategic innovations and the dedication of naval officers under his command,” Agbese said.

“By protecting the nation’s blue economy, the Chief of Naval Staff has helped to stabilise government revenue at a time when Nigeria’s economic survival depends on it. His efforts resonate far beyond our shores, earning him respect in the global naval community. I commend him for showing that with vision and discipline, our armed forces can deliver solutions that transform both our economy and our security.”

On the role of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt.-Gen. Olufemi Oluyede, Agbese, was emphatic that his field-driven leadership style has begun to turn the tide in troubled theatres of operation.

He said Oluyede’s tactical innovations and insistence on officers leading from the front have boosted morale among soldiers and shaken the confidence of insurgents and bandits.

“General Oluyede is not a desk officer; he is on the ground with the troops. His operational strategy has degraded terrorist enclaves in the North-East and weakened bandit networks in the North-West. Communities are regaining confidence because they see the Army’s presence and feel its renewed vigour,” Agbese observed.

He added that Oluyede’s outreach to local communities in conflict zones has also created fresh avenues for intelligence-gathering, which is proving decisive in anticipating and thwarting attacks.

“Security cannot be won by bullets alone; it requires the trust of the people. General Oluyede understands this and has fostered the kind of community collaboration that gives our troops a critical advantage,” he said.

Agbese, who is also a member of the Pan-African Parliament, pledged to use his continental platform to push for deeper regional defence cooperation.

“I will present model laws at the forthcoming Pan-African Parliament plenary in Johannesburg. Nigeria must not only lead the fight with strength on the battlefield but also with intellect at the policy level,” Agbese said.

He explained that the PAP develops laws for domestication across the continent, adding: “There is no better time to design a continental framework for combating insecurity than now, when Nigeria’s security architecture has taken the lead and is yielding results.”

On calls for the sack of the service chiefs, the deputy spokesperson said Nigerians must reject the “propaganda of despair.” According to him, those amplifying such calls are unwittingly aiding a terrorist strategy.

“Our service chiefs are among the finest officers in Africa today. They are respected globally for their professionalism and results. To call for their removal now is to sabotage the progress we are making. We cannot allow terrorists to set our agenda,” he declared.

Agbese urged Nigerians to remain steadfast in their support for the armed forces while holding leaders accountable through constructive engagements.",https://thenationonlineng.net/cds-service-chiefs-have-made-tremendous-gains-in-war-against-terrorism-banditry-agbese/,https://thenationonlineng.net
Ogun 2027: Adeola’s burgeoning strength and fears of others,"Ogun 2027: Adeola’s burgeoning strength and fears of others

By Olanrewaju Fatunmbi

An ideal of good governance begins with the selection of candidates for an election. It is the most critical starting point for a healthy democracy. If the selection process is transparent, free, fair, and credible, emerging contestants will not only be accountable to the people, but they will also be responsive to their needs. Being responsive to the needs of the populace is seeking the happiness of the greatest number of people.

On the other hand, in a system where candidates are chosen in a backroom deal by a political godfather, their primary allegiance is not to the electorate, but to the person who put them there. They are accountable to a single individual or a small clique, not the wider populace.

A transparent primary election forces a candidate to campaign and win the trust of party members and, by extension, the public. This makes them accountable to the people who voted for them. If a candidate secures the nomination through a fair and transparent process, he will be less indebted to special interests, and he is more likely to serve the public good.

In Nigeria, one of the reasons for the growing culture of impunity in governance is the manipulation of the leadership selection process and a lack of a level playing field. Almost all political parties have been criticized for a lack of internal democracy and barefaced imposition of candidates, which has become a rule rather than an exception.

If the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State is genuinely desirous of a seamless succession process, the leadership of the party must wash its hands off any form of manipulation that could trigger internal disaffection. A desperate attempt by some individuals to manoeuvre the selection process for the governorship candidate of the party has been uncovered.

It behoves the stakeholders to halt the power-play intrigues in the interest of the sustenance of peace and unity within the rank and file of the party. Experience has taught us enough lessons about anointing an unpopular candidate. We cannot afford to repeat the same mistake because Ogun State deserves nothing short of a capable successor who can consolidate the legacy of the current administration of Governor Dapo Abiodun.

Not crass opportunistic individuals who want power for self-aggrandizement at all costs. For continuity, we need a refined mind, a capable individual, imbued with the right leadership values, requisite knowledge, experience, and a proven track record of good performance. Someone who understands the technicalities of governance, rather than an unprepared individual who lacks a clear vision for the next level of development and economic prosperity for all and Sundry.

One of the leading contestants for the governorship race, who has a commanding height, encompassing all the right qualities to lead the state, is Solomon Olamilekan Adeola (aka Yayi). His name resonates across all sections of the state. His towering leadership capacity is evident in various projects he has facilitated across all sectors, including education, economy, agriculture, healthcare, infrastructure, human capital development, job creation, youth and women empowerment, among others.

Having the capacity to govern is more than academic qualifications or mere political patronage. While academic qualifications and a deep understanding of policy are very important, they are just a part of the puzzle. It’s a combination of other critical variables like experience, emotional intelligence, vision and strategic thinking, right exposure, courage, decisiveness, integrity, trust in grassroots connection, and commitment to effective service delivery.

Senator Adeola’s representation track record embodies these virtues. Leveraging his extensive legislative experience and connection with his constituents, he has acquired an in-depth understanding of the technicalities of governance. He has spent over two decades in the legislature, giving him a deep understanding of the challenges of governance at different levels.

He was a member of the Lagos State House of Assembly from 2003 to 2011. During this time, he was instrumental in the enactment of the law that significantly boosted Lagos’s internal revenue, a clear demonstration of his grasp of fiscal policy.

Thereafter, he served in the House of Representatives from 2011 to 2015, where he chaired the powerful House Committee on Public Accounts. As a two-term Senator, representing Lagos West from 2015 to 2023 and currently representing Ogun West since 2023, combined with his position as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations in the 10th Senate, he is currently playing a key role that gives him a deep understanding of the national budget and fiscal management.

Beyond his legislative experience, he is a chartered accountant, a qualification that sets him apart as a technocrat with a strong command of financial matters. His professional background and legislative experience, particularly in finance and public accounts, are seen by his supporters as qualities that are essential for a governor who will be responsible for managing the state’s finances and driving economic growth.

A major factor in Yayi’s rise is his position as a champion for the Ogun West senatorial district, which has never produced an elected governor.

He is seen as a unifying figure for the Yewa/Awori people, who have long felt marginalized in the state’s political landscape. His move from Lagos to contest in Ogun in 2023 was a powerful statement of his commitment to his ancestral home.

Critical stakeholders in his Senatorial District, including traditional rulers, prominent figures, and grassroots supporters, see his gubernatorial bid not just as a personal ambition but as a political movement to correct a historical injustice and ensure equity in the state.

Above his other contenders, he has a strong grassroots following, which he has cultivated through numerous empowerment programs and infrastructural projects in his senatorial district. These initiatives, which include scholarships, financial support for traders, and the facilitation of public infrastructure, have earned him immense goodwill and a reputation as a leader who is in touch with the needs of the people.

Additionally, Senator Adeola has the political machinery and war chest necessary to successfully contest the governorship race. Having served in different political capacities, he has built a formidable political machinery and has the financial resources to mount a serious and competitive campaign. His wide network and influence extend beyond his senatorial district, as he has worked to build alliances in Ogun Central and Ogun East.

His formidable profile is based on his impressive political resume, his professional background as an accountant, his position as the leading voice for the Ogun West agenda, and his demonstrated ability to mobilize grassroots support. He is a key figure in the APC’s succession battle, and his ability to navigate the complex internal party politics will be a decisive factor in the 2027 elections.

That implies that there must be a level playing field rather than crooked manipulation of the process in favour of a self-anointing candidate. It is only a free, fair, and credible process that can guarantee internal cohesion and a genuine sense of belonging for all and Sundry.

One strong factor that is going to work in favour of Senator Adeola is the political capital he brings to bear in the Ogun State governorship race. His support base, particularly in his home senatorial district of Ogun West, is not just a collection of voters but a well-organized and deeply motivated political machine.

His candidacy is inextricably linked to the historical injustice of the Ogun West senatorial district never having produced an elected governor. This is a powerful, unifying narrative that transcends party lines and personal affiliations within the district.

By championing this cause, he has positioned himself as the standard-bearer for the aspirations of the Yewa/Awori people. This gives him a solid, emotionally charged support base that is highly important to his success.

Yayi has built a robust political structure within Ogun West, capable of mobilizing voters and delegates. This is not just a matter of having supporters but having an organized and disciplined team that can deliver votes when it matters most.

The political capital Adeola has in his home base is a major advantage. It is a potent combination of a powerful emotional narrative and a well-organized political machinery. This makes him a formidable force in the governorship race and a candidate who cannot be underestimated, as his political strength is built on a foundation of both a committed and grateful electorate.

The President of the Coalition of Supporters Group of Nigeria (COSGON), Professor Kunle Awosika, has raised alarm over what he described as the “systematic decay” in the Nigerian Federation of Gymnastics (NFG), also known as the Gymnastics Federation of Nigeria, urging the government to step in immediately.

In an open letter to the media, Awosika alleged that the federation has been engulfed in leadership crises, unconstitutional tenure elongation, and election irregularities.

He warned that the administration’s mismanagement has eroded credibility and pushed the sport to the brink of collapse.

“We are no longer dealing with just poor leadership. This is now about the death of a sport that once held promise for Nigeria’s Olympic ambitions,” Awosika said.

He lamented that athletes are denied access to quality training facilities and international competitions, while grassroots development has been abandoned, leaving Nigeria lagging behind even smaller African nations in gymnastics.

Awosika urged the Federal Ministry of Sports Development, the National Sports Commission, and the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) to urgently investigate the Federation’s activities.

He also appealed to the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) to deploy an independent fact-finding mission to Nigeria.

“The credibility and future of Nigerian gymnastics are at stake. The current trajectory can no longer be ignored. It is time for decisive, corrective action,” he stressed.

COSGON further warned that if the government fails to act, it would mobilize civil society, athletes, and the sporting community for nationwide advocacy campaigns and possible legal action.",https://thenationonlineng.net/cosgon-president-awosika-seeks-govt-intervention-over-systematic-decay-in-nfg/,https://thenationonlineng.net

Super Eagles : what next amid forlorn hope for World Cup 26,"Super Eagles : what next amid forlorn hope for World Cup 26

The Super Eagles have found themselves in a challenging position as they aim for a spot in the FIFA World Cup 2026, facing the grim prospect of missing the tournament for the second consecutive time. With the qualification process nearing its conclusion during the upcoming International break, hope is dwindling among fans and analysts alike, writes MORAKINYO ABODUNRIN

Historically, the Super Eagles have been a dominant force in African football. Their golden era during the 1990s saw them qualify for three consecutive World Cups, showcasing their potential on the international stage. Notable performances include their debut at the 1994 World Cup in the USA, where they narrowly lost to Italy in the second round, and the thrilling matches in France 1998.

However, the trajectory of the team took a downturn after missing the 2006 World Cup, a setback attributed to a lackadaisical approach by the Nigerian Football Federation. The team barely managed to secure their spot for the 2010 tournament in South Africa following the intervention of a Presidential Task Force.

That was also followed by appearance at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil where the coach Stephen Keshi-led side lost a dramatic second round match to France no thanks to their stand-down on sharing of bonuses and allowances.

In between 2014 and the last Mundial in Russia, the Super Eagles missed two African Cup of Nations finals in 2015 (Equatorial Guinea) and 2017(Gabon) until German trainer Gernot Rohr whipped them in line to pick the ticket to the Russia 2018 World Cup.

The NFF would soon press their usual self-destruction button towards the tail end for the Qatar 2022 Wold Cup campaign and fired Rohr weeks to the African Final Qualifying Playoff tie against the Black Stars of Ghana , who edged the Super Eagles to the ticket on the away-goals rule.

The current qualification campaign for the 2026 World Cup has been nothing short of disastrous. Frequent changes in coaching staff have unsettled the squad, leading to a poor performance characterized by just three points from the first four matches. Following a difficult draw against South Africa, the team finds itself in a challenging position, currently ranking third in Group C, and requiring significant victories in their remaining matches.

Coach Eric Sekou Chelle remains hopeful, insisting that the Super Eagles can still qualify, but the path ahead is fraught with obstacles. Their chances depend not just on winning their remaining matches against Lesotho and Benin, but also on the outcomes of other teams in the group—most notably South Africa and Benin.

“To draw with South Africa in South Africa is a good result, but we wanted to win, so we’re a bit disappointed tonight,” Chelle said after Tuesday’s 1-1 draw way to table leader, South Africa. “My players are professionals, and I know they will still want to win the remaining two games. A lot can happen over the next one month.”

Indeed, Rohr who led Nigeria to her last Mundial at Russia 2018, hinted that the Super Eagles could be making a wild goose chase as far as the ticket for the ticket for the 2026 FIFA World Cup is concerned, adding the Chelle-led side virtually lost the plot with Tuesday’s draw in Bloemfontein.

“We are happy about this great victory (over Lesotho) and we are eagerly awaiting FIFA’s decision to take three points away from South Africa and give it to Lesotho because that is the rule,” the erstwhile Super Eagles’ manager told NationSport even as he rued Nigeria’s draw away to South Africa.

“Of course, I predicted a win for Nigeria against South Africa but they got a draw , so they have a very small chance to qualify because there’s still hope for second-placed teams across the groups,” he said, reinforcing how difficulty October could be for the Super Eagles . “But it can be difficult for Nigeria because they would need more points; I feel pity for my former players that they might not be going to the next World Cup.”

To make matters worse, the new qualification format introduced by FIFA has complicated the chances of a successful campaign. Africa is set to have nine direct slots for the World Cup, with additional opportunities for the best runners-up through play-offs—a process that constrains Nigeria’s chances even further, given their current position.

As the team prepares for the final matches in October, the echoes of past glories seem distant, and the spectre of missing out on the 2026 World Cup looms large. With several other African teams positioned better in their respective groups, the Super Eagles will need not only to rely on their own performances but also on the misfortunes of their rivals.

Currently, Burkina Faso is second with 15 points in Group A behind Egypt (20points); In Group B Democratic Republic of Congo sits on 16 points behind Senegal (18 points) ; in Group D, the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon are second with 15 points behind Cape Verde (19).

Elsewhere in Group E, Gabon are second on 19 points behind Cote d’Ivoire (20); Algeria leads Group F with 19 points and followed closely by Uganda with 15 points and even in Group H, Namibia are on 15 points behind already qualified Tunisia (22 points).

The stakes couldn’t be higher, and the Super Eagles’ fate now hinges on a mixture of determination, skill, and perhaps a bit of luck as they aim to revive their fortunes and make their mark on the global stage once again.

“ It is a shame that the Super Eagles have found themselves on this route and it would be a bigger shame if Nigeria fail to make it to the 2026 FIFA World Cup at a time almost 10 African teams would be in attendance,” a local commentator said during the week.

The coming weeks will be crucial; for Nigerian football fans, the hope remains that their beloved team can defy the odds and claw their way back into contention for the World Cup.

Mouktar wants structured welfare plans for retiring athletes,"Mouktar wants structured welfare plans for retiring athletes

Victor Oguntade

In the wake of abject lifestyle of many Nigerian athletes particularly footballers after their storied career with clubs and country, Chairman of the Federal Capital Territory Football Association (FCT FA),Adam Mouktar Mohammed, has called for a structured welfare packages for retiring sports men and women.

In a session tagged “The Welfare of Nigeria’s Sports Legends” on Sports File, a talk show on Africa Independent Television (AIT), Mouktar said it was about time that government through the National Sports Commission (NSC), put together data bank of athletes in order to see to their welfare during and after their active years

“I think it’s a case of lack of plan, like I always say. They haven’t been properly educated, how to behave, how to act, how to plan, how to live and then the life after retirement ,” Mouktar marshalled his views, adding there must be concerted efforts on the part of the government too

He continued: “This needs to be taken into a plan for them to be taken care of. They’ve served the country, but once they just finish, go sideways and everyone forgets about them and their welfare.”

On whether it is a personal responsibility of respective individuals or government to cater for retiring athletes , Mouktar insisted that it is a shared duty, dismissing the culture of buck passing as he called for robust collective planning.

“It’s a two-sided coin because we’re talking about Nigeria and Nigerians here,” he said. “Nigeria is for all of us.

“Government is for us, the people vote the government and the government works for them.

“ But we try to push the blame all the time. I’m saying no, we shouldn’t keep passing the buck. We need to sit together and devise a plan. It’s not a rocket science.

“We don’t need to invent something, we only need to copy a model that can work for us.”

For Mouktar, structured welfare packages does not mean placing athletes on perpetual salaries. Instead, he emphasized financial education, counselling and life planning as critical elements.

Addressing what structures should be put in place, Mouktar highlighted the importance of embedding athlete welfare in legislation. He referenced the ongoing reforms within the Sports Commission, led by Mallam Shehu Dikko and Honourable Bukola Olopade, as an opportunity to push for comprehensive frameworks.

He continued: “There should be a proper framework, a proper roadmap as to even identifying talents across the zones and even outside Nigeria.

“We’ve missed a lot of players, particularly footballers and track-and-field athletes, to other countries.

“We need to streamline and put things into law. It shouldn’t be a use-and-dump relationship, but more of a marriage between the nation and the athletes.”

He suggested a categorization system that distinguishes legendary figures like late Peter Rufai from athletes who only made cameo appearances in the green and white colours. He insisted that all who represented Nigeria at one point or the other deserved a safety net, describing them as “national assets”.

On whether athletes deserve some sort of pensions in their active days, Mouktar canvassed contributory pensions while pushing for broader social responsibility mechanisms. He stressed that while government and institutions must create frameworks, athletes also bear responsibility for personal financial management.

“Pensions are good and possible if it’s written into law,” he stated matter-of-factly. “But pensions are contributory, so if you’re competing or earning, you keep contributing.

“ At the same time, I believe in a proper plan to carry them along. If you don’t take care of yourself, you cannot always blame government.”

Asked about why some legends like Kanu Nwankwo and Austin Jay-Jay Okocha remain financially stable while others struggle, Mohammed explained that not all careers are equal. He linked disparities to luck, earnings, and lifestyle choices. However, he emphasized the need for early guidance and training.

He offered with hard-punching emphasis: “Of course, some don’t cut their coats according to their clothes. That’s where we are missing it.

“ It has to do with training these players at the right time. It’s like having a son—you don’t guide him, he listens to friends and goes astray. Even in Europe, your environment shapes who you become. But in the UK, for instance, they have numerous programs to reintegrate athletes—ambassadorial roles, punditry, technical coaching, or even support for those with drug issues or dementia. That’s the kind of broad approach we need.”

Mouktar, therefore, called on federations, private companies and ex-athletes to commit more to best welfare practices. He explained that federations, though technically independent, are government-backed and must develop stronger policies to retain talents. He also proposed tax incentives to encourage private sector investment in sports development.

“Imagine if conglomerates build pitches in communities and get tax rebates. If they sponsor teams, they should get benefits. That way, companies will deliberately pump money into sports. It won’t be by chance but through deliberate effort,” he noted

He also lamented Nigeria’s loss of athletes to other nations, citing examples in football and athletics, and stressed the need for better image management and reputation building to keep future generations committed to the country.

summarising his roadmap for sports development, Mouktar called for a “holistic document” that unifies Nigeria’s sports governance in line with international standards. He suggested borrowing best practices from countries like Australia, Germany, and the US. He also advocated for a Sports Tax Fund similar to the Education Tax Fund, as well as revenue from betting, lotteries, and media rights.

“There must be a plan if you think about it and sit deliberately with a group that includes administrators, athletes, and unions. They’ll tell you what could fit us best. We’re not as rich as the developed world, but we must have something to be proud of. If we deliberately think it through and put policies in place, we can ensure our legends are not forgotten.”

The session ended with a reminder that while government, federations, and corporations must play their roles, athletes also bear responsibility to live within their means and prepare for life after active competition.

In conclusion , Mouktar stressed that Nigeria must abandon its “ad-hoc” culture in sports management and replace it with deliberate, structured and sustainable planning.",https://thenationonlineng.net/mouktar-wants-structured-welfare-plans-for-retiring-athletes/,https://thenationonlineng.net
"Isak, Arokodare, Chukwueze to lead parade of new EPL signings","Isak, Arokodare, Chukwueze to lead parade of new EPL signings

The Premier League returns this weekend after a two-week pause with clubs eager to show off their new transfer window purchases, none more so than champions Liverpool for whom Alexander Isak could make his debut at Burnley on Sunday.

Of course, there is Nigerian interests with the Super Eagles duo of Tolu Arokodare and Samuel Chukwueze would expectedly turn out for their new English clubs this weekend after both being involved in late transfer moves just before the International break.

Arokodare who moved from Belgian side Genk to Wolverhampton Wanderers could make his dream EPL debut in Saturday’s trip to Newcastle while Chukwueze who left on a loan deal from AC Milan to Fulham to join his compatriots, Alex Nwobi and Calvin Bassey, may debut in front of the home fans tomorrow at the Craven Cottage against Leeds.

Meanwhile, an astonishing 3 billion pounds ($4.05 billion) was spent by the 20 clubs in England’s top-flight, a fair chunk of it in the last few days of trading as clubs beefed up their squads for the months ahead.

Isak’s acrimonious split from Newcastle United was finally resolved in the nick of time, with Liverpool paying a British record 125 million pounds for the Swedish goal-machine.

The 25-year-old did not play a single minute for Newcastle this season as he was effectively frozen out and while he did come off the bench for a brief cameo for Sweden against Kosovo on Monday, it is unlikely he will start at Burnley.

However, manager Arne Slot will be keen to give him some minutes at Turf Moor where Liverpool will be seeking to maintain their 100% start to the defence of their crown with a fourth win.

Isak may have been the highest-profile summer deal but several other clubs resume their Premier League campaigns eager to try out some expensive new toys.

Arsenal are likely to hand a first start to Eberechi Eze at home to Nottingham Forest, a club who not only added Oleksandr Zinchenko, Dilane Bakwa, and Cuiabano on deadline day but since replaced manager Nunu Espirito Santo with Ange Postecoglou.

Former Tottenham Hotspur manager Postecoglou can expect a baptism of fire on his return to north London, especially with Arsenal still smarting from their loss at Liverpool.

After two successive defeats, Manchester City host Manchester United on Sunday in the weekend’s big derby with manager Pep Guardiola’s side trailing their neighbours in the standings. All eyes will be on who Guardiola puts in goal after the last-minute signing of Gianluigi Donnarumma.

United, who have four points after a last-gasp win against Burnley, will almost certainly also have a debutant in goal after the arrival of Senne Lammens on deadline day.

Aston Villa have endured a poor start with one point and no goals from their first three games so expect to see their deadline day signings feature away to Everton tomorrow.

Jadon Sancho, on loan from Manchester United, will give Villa some much-needed attacking spark while Harvey Elliott, surplus to requirements at Liverpool, could also start.

Everton, for whom loan signing Jack Grealish has been in scintillating form so far, will be buoyant after spending 97 million pounds in initial transfer fees during the summer and could give a debut to new midfielder Merlin Rohl.

Tottenham Hotspur travel to West Ham United on Saturday as they begin a new era following the shock exit of executive chairman Daniel Levy after 25 years in charge of the club.

His parting gift may have been the signing of Randal Kolo Muani on loan from Paris St Germain on deadline day and he could make his debut at the London Stadium.

Newcastle fans may lament the bitter loss of Isak, but softening that blow was the signing of Yoane Wissa from Brentford for a reported 55 million pounds.

Wissa will have the opportunity to instantly endear himself with the St James’ Park faithful at home to bottom club Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday.

Brentford, who also lost forward Bryan Mbeumo in the summer to Manchester United, signed Arsenal’s Reiss Nelson to bolster their attack and he could feature at home to Chelsea in Saturday’s late evening offering.

One deadline-day deal that failed to complete was Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi’s expected sale to Liverpool.

Palace fans will be relieved to see the inspirational central defender, who scored his first England goal on Tuesday, back in red and blue at home to Sunderland tomorrow.",https://thenationonlineng.net/isak-arokodare-chukwueze-to-lead-parade-of-new-epl-signings/,https://thenationonlineng.net

12 ways Nigeria’s economy has changed structurally,"12 ways Nigeria’s economy has changed structurally

By Tope Fasua

The Special Adviser to the President on Economic Matters in the Office of the Vice President, Tope Fasua, outlined 12 major ways the Nigeria’s economy has evolved under President Bola Tinubu’s administration.

According to him, the notable shifts include:

1. Only 3% of gdp is oil and gas. They rest is non oil.

2. Better capturing of entertainment sector where many youths are involved.

3. Higher volumes of local manufacturing due to weaker naira and reduced imports.

4. 30% increase in non oil exports and 30% reduction in all imports.

5. New oil and gas industry where Nigeria is net exporter of refined petroleum to US and Saudi and UAE while we have become a new importer of crude oil. Disappearance of fuel queues with ease of local production by Dangote etc.

6. Incentive for non-oil exports like cocoa, cashew, soybean, etc with cheaper naira. Cocoa exports made N4trillion for Nigerians in 2024. May be better in 2025. Many have returned to the Land. Palm oil, cocoa, cashew, soybean driving the market and making profits for companies and individuals alike.

7. Value addition to raw materials becoming a main driver of the economy. Export of manufacturers especially FMCGs and even cars along west African region.

8. Explosion of hard infrastructure at state levels. Roads, bridges, captive electricity like solar, complemented by FG investment in infrastructure, which is the only way to reduce multidimensional poveety.

9. Stable Naira good for planning. Reversal of unnecessary hemorrhage of foreign currency. Many foreign schools now coming to establish in Nigeria eg Charterhouse, King’s College etc. Japa for Masters degree has reduced sharply.

10. Stable naira is helped by increasing foreign reserves …$42 billion and growing.

11. Higher salaries for many workers in private and public sector …helping to mitigate the inflationary effects. More tax reliefs coming Jan 1 2026.

12. More business opportunities in the local economy as a result of focus on naira and not dollar.",https://thenationonlineng.net/12-ways-nigerias-economy-has-changed-structurally/,https://thenationonlineng.net
Zamfara supports local businesses with over N1bn,"Zamfara supports local businesses with over N1bn

Zamfara Governor Dauda Lawal has assured local entrepreneurs of constant support through grants and provision of an enabling environment.

He spoke while inaugurating the distribution of grants under the SABER (SERBS) programme at the JB Yakubu Secretariat, Gusau.

A statement by the Governor’s spokesperson, Sulaiman Bala Idris, explained the State Action on Business Enabling Reforms (SABER) Program represents a landmark in the state’s economic renewal.

The statement added that SABER is a five-year, performance-based, multi-sectoral initiative supported by the World Bank, carefully designed to dismantle barriers, stimulate private enterprise, and generate sustainable jobs for the people of Zamfara.

“N150,000 will be distributed to 2,000 beneficiaries across the state to support nano and micro businesses. Additionally, 1,000 individuals in small and medium-sized businesses will receive N500,000 each. Furthermore, 60 people from medium—and large-scale businesses will benefit from a grant of N5 million each,” the statement reads.

Lawal noted that SABER is no ordinary intervention, affirming the total amount allocated for the disbursement component of the programme is approximately N1.1 billion, with funding support ranging from $20 million USD to $52 million USD between 2022 and 2026.

“We are gathered today to launch the program with the commencement of the disbursement of money to support various categories of businessmen and women throughout the state.

“There are three main categories of disbursements to be made. We have carefully reviewed relevant government institutions and the private sector, represented by the Chamber of Commerce leadership, to select beneficiaries in each support category,” the Governor stated.

Lawal further stressed that the SABER program, coordinated by the Ministry of Budget and Planning, is implemented by various MDAs, including the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, ZAGIS, and others like Finance, Agriculture, and Justice. It also involves the Internal Revenue Service, Housing Corporation, and ZITDA, working in conjunction with the Ease of Doing Business Committee.

CEO/Director General of Nigeria’s Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency (SMEDAN), Charles Odii, commended Governor Dauda Lawal for his numerous efforts to support local businesses in Zamfara State.

“I am glad that His Excellency the governor is not paying lip service to developing small businesses in Nigeria. I was sitting there, hearing that 2,000 businesses will get N150,000. I think it is important that if a small business owner gets N150,000, he will employ one person,” Odii said.",https://thenationonlineng.net/zamfara-supports-local-businesses-with-over-n1bn/,https://thenationonlineng.net

Manufacturers turn to alternative sources to tackle power challenges,"Manufacturers turn to alternative sources to tackle power challenges

To overcome the recurring power challenges in industries, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) members now focus on alternative sources to enable their businesses remain afloat.

Its Assistant Director, Corporate Affairs and Communication, Segun Alabi, stated this on Tuesday on during the opening of the three-day 12th Propak West Africa exhibition at Landmark Centre, Victoria island, Lagos.

“We do this by ensuring that most of our members use solar and also get what is needed for them to achieve full capacity and utilisation of their various factories. We ensure that we have engagement with our members to ensure that we emphasise on sustainability and, very importantly, on the sources of energy and power,’’ he added.

He said the manufacturers ensures sustainability in their packaging, adding that they are being conscious about degraded materials.

He praised the organisers of the exhibition, Afrocet Montgomery, which ends today, saying that for them to have held the event for 12 years shows the firm’s consistency and commitment to what it believes in.

He added: “The standard has not reduced. And, then, I want to say at the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, we are proud partners with Propak West Africa and we continue to do this. And we support the initiative and the vision behind this exhibition. And we are proud to be partners again this year.

"Why we accept West African deportees from U.S., by Ghana","Why we accept West African deportees from U.S., by Ghana

The Ghanaian government has explained why it opened its doors for West African deportees from the United States.

President John Mahama cited the regional bloc ECOWAS’ free movement protocol that allows citizens of member states to enter and reside in other West African countries without a visa for up to 90 days.

Ghana has become the latest country to accept people deported from the U.S. as part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

President Mahama said nationals from various West African countries would now be taken in following a bilateral agreement with the U.S. He said 14 had already arrived.

Last month, the U.S. deported seven migrants to Rwanda while in July, five were sent to Eswatini and eight others to South Sudan.

The 14 people already deported to Ghana include “several” Nigerians and a Gambian, the president said. He did not specify the total number of deportees the country would take.

He said Ghana had already facilitated the return of the Nigerians to their country by bus while the Gambian was still being assisted to return home.

“We were approached by the U.S. to accept third-party nationals who were being removed from the U.S. And we agreed with them that West African nationals were acceptable,” Mahama said.

“All our fellow West African nationals don’t need visas to come to our country,” he added.

He justified the decision by saying West Africans “don’t need a visa anyway” to come to Ghana.",https://thenationonlineng.net/why-we-accept-west-african-deportees-from-u-s-by-ghana/,https://thenationonlineng.net
Indiana NIDO kingpins receive CBI African Icons Merit Award (AIMA),"Indiana NIDO kingpins receive CBI African Icons Merit Award (AIMA)

History was made on Saturday, September 6, 2025, as the CBI Community Network launched her maiden edition of the prestigious CBI African Icons Merit Award.

The event, held at the Global Village Welcome Center, Indianapolis, was a night of glamour, excellence and cultural pride, which brought together eminent personalities across various African communities in the state of Indiana. Seventeen prestigious awards in different categories were given, out of which Nigerians in Diaspora Organization claimed three.

Prominent among the celebrated honorees were three distinguished leaders of the Nigerians in Diaspora Organization (NIDO) Indiana Chapter—Chief Emannuel Nsonwu, Chief Henry Onochie and Bishop Dr. Sunday Robert Eze.

NIDO Indiana has excelled in mobilising, supporting and creating opportunities for new and old Nigerian-based immigrants in the diaspora.

The awardees are:

* Chief Henry Onochie – A prominent industrialist and founder of HCO, an award winning architectural firm of international repute. Deeply rooted in African heritage, Chief Onochie’s leadership spans across NIDO Indiana and the Ozo Society of Onitsha, reflecting a life dedicated to both cultural preservation and professional excellence. While receiving the award, Chief Henry Onochie expressed his appreciation to the organizers and encouraged the youths to remain focused, purposeful, and patient in their pursuits.

* Chief Emmanuel Nsonwu – Emeritus President of NIDO Indiana and a member of NIDO’s Unified National Board of Directors. His leadership has advanced the welfare of Nigerians abroad, directly impacting thousands within Indiana and across the United States. Chief Nsonwu emphasized the importance of preserving our culture and upholding our legacies by carrying them into our new home country, where future generations can learn and draw strength from them. He spoke extensively on the need to sustain our moral values and cultural heritage as guiding principles for our community.

* Bishop Dr. Sunday Robert-Eze – President and CEO of Embassy Business Group and Managing Partner at Modern Woodmen of America, he has guided hundreds of families and small businesses toward financial stability, offering customized life insurance, retirement plans, and wealth-building strategies. He served for two terms as General Secretary and Board Trustee of NIDO Indiana. His contributions have strengthened cultural, social, and economic ties between Africans abroad and their home countries, reinforcing NIDO’s mission at both local and international levels. Bishop Robert-Eze, in his response to the gesture, emphasized the importance of unity and collaboration among Africans in driving the collective will for progress.

Under their leadership, NIDO Indiana has spearheaded life-changing initiatives such as passport intervention programs, National Identification Number (NIN) registration, and Bank Verification Number (BVN) assignments. These initiatives have spared countless Nigerians the financial and logistical burdens of long-distance travel for critical national documentation—making government services more accessible to the diaspora.

Convener and founder of CBI Community Network, Mr. Sunday Lanre Omotoso, popularly known as Larritosh, said: “The award is not a gift but a merit.”

Book stirs dialogue on Africa’s nonprofit funding gaps,"Book stirs dialogue on Africa’s nonprofit funding gaps

Development leaders, funders and civil society practitioners recently gathered in Lagos for the unveiling of a book: From Grant Zero to Hero: How to Make Funders Say Yes.

It was a debut book by nonprofit executive and author, Laura Ede.

The book, which focuses on the dynamics of grant-making and equipping nonprofits with practical tools to secure funding, was launched on September 6.

Beyond the unveiling, the event evolved into a platform for sober reflection and dialogue on the realities of nonprofit financing in Africa.

Anchored around a panel session titled: “Rethinking Funding in a Limited Capital Landscape,” the gathering addressed shrinking donor pools, global policy shifts, and the urgent need for sustainability in the development sector.

The discussion was moderated by Emmanuel Etim, a social entrepreneur and development advocate.

It featured two seasoned voices—Oje Ivagba, Programme Director at the Ishk Tolaram Foundation, who spoke from the funder’s perspective, and Oluwakemi Odedeyi, nonprofit leader and strategist, who represented the fundee viewpoint.

Ivagba stressed the importance of structure and accountability, noting that passion without clear strategies often weakens nonprofit funding applications. “Too often, nonprofits come to us with passion but without structure. Funders need to see strategy, not just heart,” he said.

From the other side of the table, Odedeyi highlighted the operational and human challenges faced by grassroots organizations, especially when donor priorities shift.

“Every global policy change, whether it is USAID cuts or shifts in donor focus, filters down to us. Local organizations must innovate, collaborate and find ways to survive beyond traditional grants,” she observed.

Ede, whose book served as the foundation for the discussion, emphasized that readiness goes beyond having proposals.

“Many organizations don’t realize that fund readiness is about much more than a proposal. It is about demonstrating sustainability, leadership and transparency. Donors are funding trust as much as they are funding programmes,” she explained.

The conversation later opened to the audience, with participants seeking insights on how nonprofits can balance passion with measurable impact, when to pivot towards scale, and how funding principles might apply to social enterprises and profit-making ventures.

Responding, Ede drew a distinction between passion and impact: “Passion starts the work, but it cannot sustain it. You move to impact when you can measure change beyond yourself. Passion is personal. Impact is collective.”

The panel concluded on an optimistic note, with speakers pointing to collaboration, local philanthropy and storytelling as critical levers for future nonprofit sustainability in West Africa.

The day was also marked by lighter moments, including a spirited round of “Nonprofit Bingo,” the dramatic unveiling of the book, and a symbolic commissioning where guests pledged their support. All available copies of the book were sold out before the evening closed, underscoring its relevance.

In her closing remarks, Ede described the book as the beginning of a movement: “This book is not the end of a journey; it is the start of a conversation. Every nonprofit has a hero in them, they just need the tools to show up fund-ready.”

From Grant Zero to Hero is available online via Selar and Amazon, with nonprofit leaders, funders and changemakers encouraged to obtain copies and join the growing community reimagining sustainable impact in Africa.",https://thenationonlineng.net/book-stirs-dialogue-on-africas-nonprofit-funding-gaps/,https://thenationonlineng.net
Cameroon honours Barrister Halle with award gallery dedication,"Cameroon honours Barrister Halle with award gallery dedication

Barrister Ntumfor Nico Halle, one of Cameroon’s most revered legal icons, has recently been celebrated with the dedication of his Award Gallery — a landmark event that underscores his decades of transformative leadership, humility, and service on both national and international stages.

Renowned as a Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Cameroon, Dr. Halle has amassed 202 national and international awards, distinctions, and recognitions.

His reputation for truth, transparency, and integrity is further reinforced by his decision to decline awards whose credibility he doubted.

The dedication ceremony, held on September 5, 2025, at the Shalom Building in Bonaberi, Douala, drew a diverse gathering of industry leaders, academics, clergy, and global dignitaries.

The occasion also marked the celebration of two Doctorate Honoris Causa awards and the conferral of the British title of “Sir.”

Dr. Halle’s distinguished career includes serving as President of the General Assembly of the Cameroon Bar Association, where he championed integrity in the legal profession.

His role with the National Elections Observatory (NEO) positioned him as a guardian of electoral transparency, leading to international recognition as an Elections Expert consulted worldwide. Beyond law, he has served as a reformer, consultant, and mentor for young lawyers across Africa.

Despite his towering achievements, Sir Dr. Halle remains deeply humble. Asked about his greatest title, he replied, “My greatest title is Christian.” He credited his family — particularly his wife — for their unwavering support, noting, “She has been my major inspiration in achieving many successes, including my dream of a second home. I am proud of each one of them.”

The event was chaired by Professor Paul Mbangwana, who delivered a moving tribute to Halle’s life and legacy. The dedication service was conducted by Pastor (Mrs.) Mary Wose of the Presbyterian Church Bonaberi Congregation, while Bishop Dr. Pius Inobuh Bah of Revive Christian Church International also highlighted Halle’s work as a human rights advocate.

In an era where ethical leadership is scarce, Sir Dr. Nico Halle stands as a beacon of integrity, scholarship, and faith.

"Key Argument: Export Ban Risks Shifting Profit from Women Pickers to Processors, Not the Government","Key Argument: Export Ban Risks Shifting Profit from Women Pickers to Processors, Not the Government

SHEA collection makes contribution to the total income of rural households belonging to different economic groups. Also, it quantifies the involvement of women in Shea nuts and fruits collection and processing.

Shea nut collection provides women collectors opportunity for upward economic mobility, women account for 90% of Shea nut collection and are at the lowest end of the value chain.

In Africa, the unique experience of each of the 16 million rural women who make a living from Shea nut inspires us more and more every day. Shea is an important crop, both economically and socially.

It employs 4 million women for export and generates approximately USD 600 million a year in income at the community level in West Africa. At the household level, Shea accounts for up to 12% of household income and up to 32% of cash available, which is earned during the lean season.

Moreover, Shea nut collection and processing were found to provide a valuable source of cash income to female household members who otherwise have very few income possibilities.

Shea nut collection provides economic resilience in term of income, assets and savings; Social resilience in form of women decision makeup at home. It also provides employment, medicinal benefits and nutrition.

Shea is crucial for rural women families and their livelihoods and for their generation. Shea collection and processing is a way for households to diversify their livelihood strategy and decrease their vulnerability to food insecurity and climate variability.

1. Value Redistribution Without Equity

The blanket ban on raw shea nut exports creates an artificial market structure in which:

Women pickers (who collect 90%+ of raw nuts) are forced to sell locally,

Local processors become the sole buyers, creating a monopsony (one buyer, many sellers),

Processors purchase at artificially suppressed prices, increasing their margins,

They export processed shea butter (crude or semi-refined) at global prices—capturing the bulk of the profit.

In essence, the export ban does not create new wealth—it reallocates existing wealth away from the grassroots to the processing middlemen.

2. Women and Smallholders Lose Bargaining Power

In the open market, women groups could negotiate export contracts, participate in cooperatives, or benefit from global demand-driven pricing.

Under a ban, that freedom is removed, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by dominant processors.

They bear the economic shock of lower prices while processors enjoy risk-free profits.

This contradicts the intended goals of gender empowerment and poverty alleviation. As currently designed, the ban:

Weakens rural women’s negotiating power, and

Benefits industrial processors, who may not reinvest profits locally or transparently.

3. Weak Local Processing Capacity

While Nigeria has a few industrial-scale processors and many small cottage-level producers, these facilities together can only process a hundred of thousands of metric tons of shea nuts annually which is 1/3rd of total shea nut production.

The majority of local processors are small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with limited capital. They cannot raise enough funds to buy such massive volumes upfront.

Purchasing shea nuts requires huge upfront payments during harvest season, when supply peaks.

Much of the harvested shea is left unprocessed domestically because factories lack the capacity, technology, and investment needed to handle it.

The absence of robust domestic processing and storage infrastructure results in spoilage and significant post-harvest losses.

With Nigeria producing far more shea than its industries can absorb, farmers are left without sufficient domestic buyers, forcing a substantial portion of nuts to remain unsold.

4. No Guarantee of Government Revenue

The current policy framework lacks mechanisms to ensure that processors’ profits are taxed, regulated, or redistributed for public benefit. Key risks:

Processors may under-declare profits or shift revenue offshore,

Informal and SME processors might avoid tax obligations entirely,

The government will gain little or no fiscal benefit unless tied to robust tax and compliance systems.

Without revenue capture policies, the government’s goal of economic growth becomes an illusion—growth for whom?

5. Encourages Rent-Seeking, Not Industrial Transformation

With guaranteed raw material access at cheap prices (due to the ban), some processors may lack incentive to invest in quality, innovation, or scaling capacity.

The market becomes uncompetitive and prone to rent-seeking behaviour:

Low pay to pickers,

Minimal innovation,

Export-focused without domestic development benefits.

6. Policy Inversion: The Poor Subsidizing the Rich

This policy results in the reverse of inclusive growth:

Related News

Rural women and poor smallholders subsidize the profits of processors,

Meanwhile, government collects minimal tax and provides little support infrastructure.

These risks replicating past policy failures seen in Cocoa, Cotton, and Groundnut sectors, where:

Raw material producers remained poor, despite Nigeria’s global role in supply chains.

What the Government Must Do Instead

To ensure that value addition benefits are shared, the government must urgently:

✅ 1. Mandate Fair Pricing

Require a minimum floor price for shea nuts, tied to global demand and currency valuation.

Establish price monitoring boards with women’s cooperatives as stakeholders.

✅ 2. Tax Processor Exports

Introduce value-based export taxes on processed shea products, ensuring profits are taxed.

Use collected revenue to fund rural women’s cooperatives, training, and equipment.

✅ 3. Build Cooperative Power

Direct funds to build women-led processing hubs, so women can process, brand, and

export their own products—keeping profits local.

✅ 4. Create a Phased Transition

Allow controlled raw export through licensed cooperatives while local processing capacity is scaled.

Ban should come after capacity is proven, not before.

Conclusion: A Ban Without Balance Hurts the Wrong People

While the export ban intends to drive local industrial growth, in its current form, it:

• Creates imbalance in the shea value chain,

• Shifts power and profit away from the grassroots, and

• Delivers little measurable benefit to the Nigerian government in tax or trade terms.

Instead of empowering the vulnerable, the ban consolidates market power into the hands of a few. A fair shea policy must protect women, generate state revenue, and build competitive, equitable local industry. Not one at the expense of the others.

Government is requested not to fall for developing such monopoly cartels as the local industries already having advantage of local presence and are successfully competing.

Need is also to invest in technology to enable women collectors to store the product and reduce distress sale. Access to loans and programs to support women to acquire technology would enable them to seize the more profitable segments of value chain.

Government also needs to focus on improving quality of Shea nuts and provide training to women collectors for sustainable harvesting, storage and local value addition.

Any proposed ban needs to be carefully thought in a holistic manner, giving due consideration to centuries old prevalent social customs, values, practices and rural economics, and in doing so commercial interests should be last priority which is benefiting only 2-3 local processors in creating abusive monopoly.",https://thenationonlineng.net/key-argument-export-ban-risks-shifting-profit-from-women-pickers-to-processors-not-the-government/,https://thenationonlineng.net
Food for thought for Northern Nigeria,"Food for thought for Northern Nigeria

“Woe betide a society whereby their dead leaders are better than their leaders that are alive” … Dr. Yusuf Maitama Sule CFR, the Late Dan Masanin Kano, and Former Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations

For the record, I am from Northern Nigeria, a Muslim, and a patriot of Nigeria. I am currently not a member of any political party. However, I am worried that our narratives and posturing as northerners will not change our collective situation for good unless we tell ourselves the truth and take the necessary actions.

By the way, while I am talking about northern Nigeria, the people from other regions in Nigeria should also take my message as a mirror for their regions, so that they can also make progress. Because we all have similar tendencies.

The Crux of the Issues.

It is proper and very important for interest groups of northern Nigeria, like other regional, ethnic, and religious groups in Nigeria, to continue advocating for good governance and pushing for more equitable leadership and representation at the federal level, while keeping the fee of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to fire.

However, in my view, the issues bedeviling northern Nigeria and the actual solutions will depend on how we, the northern elites and establishment, view the issues, our sincerity of purpose, and the actions that we take to address them. The root causes of most of the challenges facing Northern Nigeria are more regional and local than federal. Therefore, we must refocus, expand our vision, and change our mindsets if there is to be any hope of redemption, growth, and development.

Living in denial and blaming trade will only complicate and exacerbate our situations. The combined ticking time bombs of tribalism, ethnic jingoism, religious extremism, religious bigotry, hypocrisy, poverty, jealousy and envy, greed, hatred, erosion of our core values, corruption, etc., are part of the multi-dimensional issues that we must address as our realities. Indeed, we must also accept that the issues are mostly self-inflicted, either deliberately or inadvertently.

Consequently, political grandstanding and gaslighting will not help us but only make our matters worse. The population growth rate of northern Nigeria, the preponderance of out-of-school children, rising unemployment, youth restiveness, rising social vices, insecurity, etc., in northern Nigeria reflect our dire situation, which calls for sincere and sober reflections. Without decisive actions to contain the ugly trends rather than blaming trade, we will be doomed.

Some questions for all of us who are Nigerians from the northern region are as follows:

Having produced the highest number of Presidents and Heads of State in Nigeria, and having been key stakeholders in the political evolution of this country, how many banks are owned by northern Nigerians? How many media houses are owned by northern Nigerians? How many manufacturing plants, or factories, are owned by northern Nigerians, apart from Alhaji Aliko Dangote, Alhaji Abdulsamad Isyaku Rabiu, and a few others? How many industries or factories in Nigeria are operated or managed by northern Nigerians? How many of the former State Governors of northern Nigeria have even a “pure water” factory where they have employed 10 people? How many of all former State governors of northern Nigeria, former and serving Senators, and Members of the House of Representatives are actually employing people or that actually have scholarship programs/systems whereby they are supporting children from their constituencies, with their own money, or the money they have taken from us? How many of us own or are managing (at top level) the insurance companies, and other private financial institutions, corporate organizations, apart from the Non-Executive Directorships that we are occasionally given, to give a semblance of national outlook for Companies that are owned majorly by southern Nigerians in which we have no real stake, etc.? These are the critical indicators that will tell us whether we are moving in the right direction or not. Today, most of the masses in northern Nigeria are “on their own”, with no help from the elites.

Most times, we, the elites, only speak out loudly when it comes to issues that directly affect us or our children, but not really for the common good. How did we allow our region to slide into the abyss of over 80 million out of over 133 million multi-dimensionally poor Nigerians? Are these issues entirely the fault of a President, i.e., President Olusegun Obasanjo, President Umar Musa Yar’Adua, President Goodluck Jonathan, President Muhammadu Buhari, or the incumbent President Bola Ahmed Tinubu? Why do we have to shout all the time about issues that we are also responsible for? For example, we have a situation whereby a former northern State governor, who was a governor maybe 15 years ago, has become a glorified personal assistant to a current state governor. This speaks volumes to how we are making progress as northern Nigerians, or as Nigeria in general, because, by the way, this is not just a northern Nigeria issue.

Certainly, if we are able to speak truths to ourselves, we may start moving in the right direction. Most of our leaders block their ears, close their eyes when they are in power, whether as Presidents, Vice Presidents, State Governors, Deputy Governors, Federal and State legislators, Judges, Chief Executives, Civil Servants, etc., but they shamelessly become “latter-day activists” when they leave office, having failed to deliver good governance during their tenures. It is time that we, the people of Northern Nigeria, start calling out such leaders.

For the past 65 years in Nigeria, from independence to date, in every administration, northern Nigerians have been given the opportunity to lead or to serve. Whether the number is enough or not is not the issue. Recently, the late President Muhammadu Buhari was the President for eight years. How did our northern leaders, who were given the opportunities, perform? How did they change the fortunes of northern Nigeria within those eight years? Not long ago, during the tenure of President Goodluck Jonathan, most of the top government officials who were found blameful or responsible for the diversion of the funds that were appropriated and disbursed for the procurement of weapons to fight terrorism were from Northern Nigeria. They were found to be in cahoots with misappropriating money that was meant to save/ protect their people, other Nigerians, and residents from being looted, kidnapped, raped, maimed, and killed daily in thousands. What This is the height of wickedness! Shame! What did the northern elders, elites, or citizens do, or what are they doing to stop these menaces and evil tendencies of self-service?

Currently, the two Ministers of Defense, two Ministers of Agriculture, the Coordinating Minister of Health, Minister of Information, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Transport, the National Security Adviser, etc., are from northern Nigeria. It does not matter what political party is in power at the federal level; we always have a significant share of power and the highest number of representatives in the power dynamics of Nigeria. Therefore, what should matter is how we perform and how we utilize the opportunities.

Self-Service OR Sincere Agitation?

For instance, months into the administration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, there was agitation by the Northern elites that there was a plan by the administration to sack northerners from CBN, etc., when 70% of the children in the CBN are our children, i.e., children of the elites. What about the children of Shoe shiners or peasant farmers, etc? Are we addressing the issues of almost 70% of our public primary and secondary schools that are dilapidated, with our children that sit on bare floors, in open areas? How about the teeming Almajiris that we maltreat? Is that the responsibility of the federal government? We all know that the State governments are primarily responsible for primary and secondary schools’ education, and yet we have over 10 million children and youngsters out of school. How are we, the elites, also speaking truth to our state governors to ensure that they do the needful? So, these are the posers for us to address as Northern Nigerians.

Moreover, 70% of the leaders from North and indeed from Southern Nigeria came from humble backgrounds. But most of them forget where they come from, only when they need their votes. The fact is that about 60 or 50 years ago, they were given opportunities by leaders like Sir Ahmadu Bello, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, etc., and yet most of them have abandoned their people. Most of them were like the Almajiris of today, and yet they were given those opportunities to excel and become leaders in their Country. Now, all they think of is themselves and their children. Yet here we are blaming all our woes on any President who is in power.

Therefore, I urge our political, religious, traditional leaders, top leaders, intellectuals, and the entire elites to have a moment of introspection.

In the subsequent episode, I will continue expounding on the issues bedeviling northern Nigeria and how I think we should best address them.",https://thenationonlineng.net/food-for-thought-for-northern-nigeria/,https://thenationonlineng.net
Osun LG crisis: Jankaraism at play,"Osun LG crisis: Jankaraism at play

Ankara Was A popular slang among lawyers those days when legal practice was at its best. Those were the days when lawyers stuck to the rules of their trade. They only argued their cases in court and not on television, radio and in newspapers.

Unfortunately, the reverse is the case today. What is troubling is that lawyers who should know and set examples for young wigs as their own seniors did for them when they started out are most guilty of this unprofessional act.

They go on air masquerading as legal pundits when in fact they are discussing matters in which they are lawyers to a party. What they are doing is forbidden in law practice. It is elementary that cases are not discussed outside the hallowed precincts of the courtroom. Even law students and lay men know this. It is called sub judice in latin.

But these days, very senior lawyers have made punditry their hobby. They hop from one television and radio studio to the other, commenting on the very case they are handling in court, in breach of their practice rule. They and their interviewers try to be clever by half – pretending as if the interviewees know nothing about such cases before coming on air.

Whereas the interviewee knows a lot about the case and only came to defend his position. But they mask their intentions by skirting around other issues to deceive the gullible viewer before returning to where they are going which is the lawyer’s case in court. Thinking that he is wise, the interviewer after leading the interviewee on, will say something like this:

“That is not where I am going. I didn’t know that you are seized of this matter. Now, since we have touched on it, let’s take it up from there. What are the issues involved in the case…” Responding in kind, the lawyer will cut in: “I am seized of the case. You see… (calling the interviewer’s name), there are two judgments of the Federal High Court and a judgment of the Court of Appeal on the matter…”

And the lawyer goes on and on, without stating that he is a lawyer in the case. This is the depth to which legal practice has sunk. Regrettably, the undertakers are the many senior lawyers who are expected to shine the light for their juniors to follow, and their professional body, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA).

This is the kind of Jankara practice that eminent lawyers deplored in the olden days, even though some of then engaged in it too when it suited them. Jankara is the use of stealth to win a case by all means. It is a deplorable act which decent lawyers condemned then and still condemn now, but it has remained an untamed monster in legal practice because of the incorrigibility of many lawyers.

Jankara is a strong phrase which no lawyer wants his colleague to use for him inside or outside the court. It was fun those days watching eminent lawyers in court, doing battle over the slang. They threatened fire and brimstone, even going to the extent of saying they would withdraw their appearance, if the Judge did not ask the user of the phrase to withdraw it.

Read Also: Experts urge Nigerian universities to prioritise soft skills training to tackle youth unemployment

Going the Jankara way as witnessed in the Osun local government debacle and in other cases, particularly during the last presidential election petition matters, did not start today. The only difference is that it was limited to the courtroom then. Now, it has been brought to the marketplace. Incidentally, Jankara is the name of a popular market in Lagos, where buyers and sellers, must be at alert in order not to be duped. Otherwise, either party may end up being shortchanged.

In other words, some lawyers through their Jankara way attempt to con their colleagues and the Judge, as well, so as to obtain justice at all costs. Those who call lawyers liars may be right after all. What is happening in the Osun case has shown some lawyers for who and what they are. And these are the same lawyers who go all over the place, preaching on how to make society better.

How can a lawyer or his association that is not true to himself or itself be true to the society? Honesty is an innate quality. It is either you have it or you do not have it. What do you say of a lawyer who cannot disclose that he is involved in a case, but goes on air to analyse the same case for the viewing audience? What do you say of the NBA that comments on a case that is in court and takes sides with one of the parties? Is that a bar association? A union of motor drivers will do better than that!

NBA has since turned itself into a “busybody” in many matters. It has become a tool for blackmail and it is manipulated by many lawyers and politicians to fight their battles. At the bottom of it all is filthy lucre. There is nothing some lawyers and NBA cannot do for money.

Their deployment of Jankaraism in the Osun council case is a big shame. Yet, they call themselves ministers in the temple of justice! Ministers? Do they truly understand the halo around the name that they cherish but desecrate with so much impunity? With ministers like these, can a nation ever be saved?

These lawyers and NBA should allow the court to do its work without let or hindrance.",https://thenationonlineng.net/osun-lg-crisis-jankaraism-at-play/,https://thenationonlineng.net
The global breakdown of pacific relations,"The global breakdown of pacific relations

About two weeks ago, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, suddenly came out with an executive order changing the name of the Defence Department to War Department to indicate, according to him that he wants the potential adversaries of the US to note that the gun is loaded to be used against any country or alliance that may challenge the United States.

Since the president is in possession of intelligence that may not be available to other people, it was conceded to him that he must have a reason for the aggressive change. However, the global political environment in recent times has not been conducive to peace. The Russian war on Ukraine despite the Alaska meeting of Putin and Trump has not relented. On top of this is the unfinished war against Iran and the cruel crushing war against undefended people in Gaza that is raising the temperature of every sane person in the world. On top of this is Donald Trump’s tariff war against every trading nation with the United States without discrimination between allies and enemies.

As if in reaction, though probably a long planned and scheduled programme, the People’s Republic of China mounted a celebration of power by staging a great display of military muscle in Beijing, celebrating the surrender of Japan in 1945 as if China was responsible for forcing Japan to surrender rather than the decisive United States dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

China invited most of the authoritarian regimes in the world like Russia, Turkey, North Korea and, surprisingly India that Trump’s policy has put in the wilderness by imposing 50% trade tariff to punish it for buying cheap crude oil and gas from Russia which is helping Russia to fund its campaign against Ukraine.

India, the most populous country in the world seems to be shifting its implicit alliance from the democratic world to the changing leadership of China in a new world order led by China. To indicate that the peace of the world is under some kind of threat, the recent changes in the democratic western alliance leads one to the belief that we are witnessing mobilisation for war unless care is taken.

Recently the British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said we were living in dangerous times. This was echoed by the new American Secretary of State for War Pete Hegseth. One would have said this was the usual exaggeration for which the Donald Trump crowd is known for. But coming from the British prime minister, one cannot simply dismiss it because this was a preambular statement to the launching of a new British Defence and Strategic Review document which is going to increase Britain’s defence spending to 3% of the country’s GDP. This will be well above the current 2%, still way below the 5% President Donald Trump is demanding from all NATO member countries even though the current amount the USA is spending is $895 billion just about 3.4%of its GDP which is way above the current expenditure on defence by the next three countries of China, $ 266.85 billion, Russia $126 billion and India, which comes fourth with an expenditure of $75 billion. From these figures, it can be seen that the USA alone spends more than the next three countries combined. The British prime minister’s statement was further explained by the Secretary of State for Defence, Right Honourable John Healey, who claimed that his country aims to build about 11 attack submarines, expand the carrying capacity of the British Navy and reinvigorate the air force by buying additional American-built F35 and increase the number of British-built typhoon aircraft and start recruiting people into the fighting force of the army while keeping the current men and women happy by improving their accommodation and stipends.

All these coming from a socialist government which traditionally preferred to spend money on social services indicate that its analysis on threat to the realm is serious. This of course should be taken in the context of the NATO members feeling about the unreliability of the USA as a partner because of the statements of Trump who has perhaps rightly been saying that American Defence partners must share the burden of defence and not expect America to carry their burden as it used to do hitherto. This sharing of burden on defence extends not only to NATO members alone but to Japan and South Korea and to the rich Arab oil kingdoms and to Israel where the Israeli tail wags the American dog!

As at the moment, Trump is prepared to fight future Israeli war against Iran and to possibly level the Persian theocracy down unless it kowtows to Israeli diktat and abandons its nuclear program. The current doctrine of expanding defence spending has also been embraced by the new German chancellor, Friedrich Merz who has publicly committed his country to go beyond 3% of GDP from its current low of below 2%. Merz has signed agreements with Ukraine to help it defend itself by building its own defence industry. The German posture on defence is influenced by President Putin’s aggression in Ukraine because ordinarily Germany is forbidden to rearm because of its militaristic past but in the current global context, the Western Alliance sees nothing wrong with Germany’s rearmament. For reasons of the big powers guarantee of Germany’s permanent disarmament, the Germans would probably have built their own nuclear arsenal for which they are capable of doing and the know-how of which they have. The current aggression of Russia in Ukraine has led to President Macron’s signing defence agreements with Poland in addition to the European Union’s opposition to the Russian threat.

All these coming after Trump’s bluff that has not impressed President Putin, it seems the Europeans are determined to defend themselves with or without American support. A coordination of British, French and German preparedness to defend their interests on the continent of Europe and their threat to seize accumulated Russian financial assets and investments in Europe may eventually force Putin to count the cost of his policy of rebuilding the lost Russian empire and the reconstruction of the collapsed USSR.

Recently the security conference in Singapore to which the Chinese virtually ignored by sending a low ranking delegation to witness, the campaign of rearmament carried to their door step with President Macron delivering the key note address and offering France’s support for their defence of democracy, and development for countries in South East Asia and warning those countries of the need to be prepared to defend their country’s autonomy. He also called on China to prevail on North Korea to stop its continued intervention on the Russian side in the current war between Russia and Ukraine on European continent.

The American Secretary of State for War Pete Hegseth was less diplomatic as characteristic of American “open diplomacy” established since the time of President Woodrow Wilson at the end of the First World War by openly accusing China of threatening Taiwan and the Philippines and calling on countries in Asia to be ready to resist Chinese communist threats by increasing their arms spending. He gave the impression that America is prepared to defend Taiwan which is against Trump’s campaign statement that he would not commit American troops to the defence of Taiwan. The Japanese and the South Koreans were not openly attacking China. But Japan in recent times seems to have abandoned its pacific policy to a policy of armed neutrality in Asia but is ready to protect the Japanese homeland. In the first Trump administration, the Japanese were publicly goaded to develop their nuclear umbrella. The Japanese did not publicly state their position apart from saying the American-Japanese treaty of defence was sufficient.

My guess is that the Chinese does not have expansionist ambitions on the Philippines except to contest fishing rights on disputed islands in the South China Sea and Vietnam is capable of resisting Chinese ambitions. As for Taiwan, the eventual unification with the mainland is a foregone conclusion with or without America’s acquiescence.

To make the new Arms race palatable to the suffering electorate in Europe particularly in Great Britain, politicians are now talking of a new concept of “DEFENCE DIVIDENDS” meaning that with expansion of defence industries in their neighbourhood, jobs will be created for working class people who can either enlist in the armed forces or work in arms industries. The idea of defence dividends are not strange because when a country’s economy is put on war footing, there seems to be the appearance of full employment which is a false prosperity against which the post 2nd World war American president and previous Supreme Allied Commander in Europe during the Second World War, General David Dwight Eisenhower warned against when he advised his country against being taken over by the “military industrial complex“.

There is however no doubt that there is a growing hysteria about the possibility of an outbreak of war in Europe and the rest of us cannot just ignore it because of our distance from the current theatre of the conflict in Eastern Europe. However we can hope that like all other regional wars of the past since 1945, the Russian war in Ukraine will be contained because its spread and development into a nuclear confrontation is just too ghastly to be imagined. Even President Trump knows this and he is probably capable of palliating the military desire of his MAGA group by going to war against Venezuela and other weak countries in the Caribbean or South America accusing them of poisoning America people with their allegedly nefarious involvement in drug smuggling into the US which is less risky against a nuclear armed opponent.",https://thenationonlineng.net/the-global-breakdown-of-pacific-relations/,https://thenationonlineng.net

Nigerians will soon enjoy 24/7 power supply – Minister,"The Federal Government has said Nigeria is on the road to sustainability in the power sector.

Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, stated this in Abuja during the inauguration of two blocks housing five training workshops and a 104-room hostel at the National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN).

He said the development is a milestone for the institute and the sector, adding that President Bola Tinubu’s administration had demonstrated genuine commitment by “walking the talk and converting vision into action.”

SPONSOR AD

According to him, the government’s efforts were already yielding results with the country recording the highest power generation and transmission in its history.

“In no time, we are going to witness a country where there is 24/7 uninterrupted power supply. This is possible and we have certainly seen the signs,” he said.

The minister said the government was lighting up universities, teaching hospitals, primary health centres, public institutions and communities, stressing that power supply remained the driver of other critical sectors of the economy, including education, health and aviation.

“We have what it takes to start manufacturing our own meters, cables, transformers, transmission transformers and batteries. We have the brain. We have the people. We must be self-reliant and sustainable, and we are very close to achieving this,” he said.

The minister said the new facilities underscored government’s commitment to developing a highly skilled workforce capable of addressing challenges in a fast-changing energy landscape.

He added that the training centres and hostel would equip young Nigerians with modern tools and knowledge to drive innovation and job creation.

Director-General of NAPTIN, Ahmed Nagode, said the projects represented a foundation for a brighter future in the power sector.

He disclosed that the institute planned to explore partnerships to implement the Next Generation Rescue Programme to train and empower young Nigerian leaders.

Nagode praised the European Union (EU) and the French Government, who, through Agence Française de Développement (AFD), provided funding and technical support for the facilities.

EU Ambassador to Nigeria, Gautier Mignot, said the bloc committed €8 million to the project as part of its support for Nigeria’s power sector reforms. He said the EU had helped NAPTIN develop 95 courses, including 65 technical and 30 non-technical ones, and had invested over €200m in Nigeria’s power sector since 2008.

Mignot said the EU’s latest renewable energy package for Nigeria, worth €100m, was designed to add 400 megawatts of renewable energy by 2027, benefitting over five million Nigerians.",https://dailytrust.com/nigerians-will-soon-enjoy-24-7-power-supply-minister,https://dailytrust.com
"Bandits open fire on travellers, abduct herders in Niger","Two travellers, identified as Zakari Benjamin and Samaila, sustained gunshot injuries when bandits opened fire on a commercial vehicle along the Tegina–Kontagora road in Niger State.

The incident occurred at Tudun-Fulani when the vehicle’s driver reportedly refused to stop after being flagged down. Sources said the assailants fired at the vehicle, hitting the two men who were seated in the front passenger seat.

Locals said the attack happened shortly after bandits abducted some cattle herders at Usalle community on Wednesday evening.

The gunmen were said to have moved the victims toward the road before attempting to ambush passing vehicles near Samaza Sauri in Nagwamatse Ward, Kontagora LGA.

One source told Daily Trust: “At about 10:30pm, they kidnapped some young cattle herders around Usalle. Afterwards, they blocked the road to target travellers at Samaza Sauri. During the attack, they fired at vehicles heading into Kontagora and injured two people in the legs.”

Confirming the incident, spokesperson for the Niger State Police Command, SP Wasiu Abiodun, said: “On 11/09/2025 at about 12:15am, suspected armed men attempted to block a commercial vehicle with registration number MAK 238 XA at Tudun-Fulani, along Kontagora–Tegina road. The driver manoeuvred and escaped, but the hoodlums opened fire, injuring two passengers, Zakari Benjamin and Samaila, in their legs. Police operatives rushed the victims to hospital. None of the occupants was abducted.”

He added that police tactical teams and other security agencies were deployed to the scene, but the attackers fled into the forest.

In a related incident, bandits reportedly invaded Uzange and Matachibu communities in Masuga District of Kontagora LGA around midnight on Thursday, abducting three residents.

Residents of Kontagora, Mariga, and Magama LGAs told Daily Trust that attacks have intensified in the past two weeks, with several abductions recorded and hundreds of cattle rustled.",https://dailytrust.com/bandits-open-fire-on-travellers-abduct-herders-in-niger,https://dailytrust.com
"Food Prices Have Crashed, says Agric Minister","The prices of food items have crashed across the country, according to Minister of Agriculture and Food Security, Senator Abubakar Kyari.

The Minister said this when he featured on an ARISE TV programme on Friday.

He said President Bola Tinubu’s interventions on food security have started yielding results.

SPONSOR AD

He also defended the administration’s strategy of combining production support with temporary importation to address what he described as deep-rooted structural imbalances in the agricultural sector.

“There are tools if you want to take care of the structural imbalances in the agricultural sector,” Kyari said.

“I have said it before—even the former President of the African Development Bank during his tenure, he also imported. There are tools to manage what you already have.

“President Bola Ahmed Tinubu came at a time when there was huge structural default in terms of food security and that is why he had to declare the clarion call and emergency on food security in July 2023.

“Food availability, food security is a matter of entrepreneurial availability, supply and demand. In Nigeria so much availability and demand were not there, and part of the reason for the intervention was to ramp up production and at the same time import to make up the difference, because we do not have absolute production for all food crops that we have. Rice, for example—we have about 15% gap in what we can supply and what we have in the country.”

Kyari clarified that the temporary importation window introduced by the government was meant to stabilise prices without discouraging local farmers.

“The importation window was only for six months, and it has come and gone. And that was the amount that was demanded. When you look at the global demand field, it is not enough to make farmers discouraged with agricultural production,” he said.

“For example, while that was going on, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu ordered the Central Bank to release 2 million bags of fertiliser to the Federal Ministry of Agriculture for onward delivery free of charge at zero cost, and that was done. So at the end of the day, when you look at it, there were so many interventions. We had so many programmes that supported farmers with fertiliser at 50%. So, there was a lot of production in 2024.”

Dar Al Halal Certification: Your Gateway to a US$7 trillion+ Market Through Certification,"As Nigeria intensifies its drive to diversify foreign exchange earnings, non-oil exports are increasingly taking center stage. The nation recorded a remarkable breakthrough in the first half of 2025 with non-oil exports valued at $3.225 billion. Yet, for all this progress, one vast opportunity presents itself- accessing the US$7 trillion+ global Halal economy guided by strict halal standards.

The global halal economy spans several industries- food and beverages, agriculture and agro-allied value chain, finance, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, fashion, media, travel and tourism, and more. The certification standards of lawfulness, cleanliness, trust, ethics, and transparency have since been adopted by producers and suppliers of goods and services from the US, UK, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand to the Middle East and GCC. It thrives on processes set by leading leading Halal Certification bodies like JAKIM of Malaysia, SMIIC of Istanbul, GCC Accreditation Center (GAC) and World Halal Food Council (WHFC), without which, Nigerian goods will struggle to access markets in the Middle East and across the 57 Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries. For Nigeria, unlocking this economy is not just an economic option, but a strategic necessity.

SPONSOR AD

At the forefront of this drive is Dar Al Halal Certification, an independent certification company with a bold vision of championing the entry of Nigerian products into the global halal market and positioning the country as a major player on the world stage. Dar Al Halal’s work goes beyond certification. It is building a trusted halal ecosystem in Nigeria by combining faith principles with modern quality control systems. Its initiative is backed by a panel of technical and Shariah auditors trained by Serunai Commerce, a Malaysian company duly accredited by JAKIM and a partner to the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) through its reverse linkage program, to provide capacity building, training, and the development of Halal certification systems across multiple countries.

Raising the Bar with Global Standards

To ensure credibility, Dar Al Halal has adopted the Malaysian (JAKIM) halal certification model, benefiting from its over 50 years of regulatory expertise. Through its partnership with Serunai Commerce, Dar Al Halal certification intends on being the premier certification company in Nigeria.

Through training programs, site audits, and international exposure, it is grooming a new generation of halal inspectors, auditors, and quality control experts. Recent programs included site visits to facilities like Maidabino Farm, Al Dusar Tomato Processing Factory and The Farm (Feed Mill, Flour Mill and Diary Factory) in Katsina, giving participants firsthand experience in global best practices.

Why Halal Certification Matters

Halal certification is more than a religious label; it is a global recognized assurance of quality, hygiene and ethical production of the products and services we consume. From the animal slaughter to the safety of ingredients used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, Halal certification builds confidence for consumers that a product has undergone rigorous inspection and compliance. Importantly, halal certification is open to businesses of all faiths and for Nigerian exporters, the certification is a passport to 57 member countries of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and beyond, including fast-growing Muslim consumer markets in Asia, Europe, and North America. Already, trade opportunities are emerging, with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates signaling interest in expanding imports from Nigeria. With halal certification, these products can enter and compete freely.

The Certification Process

Dar Al Halal makes the certification journey simple yet thorough:

Submission of company and product information. Review of ingredients, supply chain sources, and manufacturing processes. Site inspection of facilities for compliance with halal standards. Audit and panel (technical and Shariah )decision on Halal. Issuance of certification, granting businesses the right to use the halal logo. Periodic audits, monitoring and renewals to ensure ongoing conformity.

This process not only builds consumer confidence but also raises the overall quality of Nigerian exports.

Conclusion

As Nigeria pushes to expand non-oil exports, halal certification offers a golden ticket to markets worth trillions of dollars. For Nigeria, embracing these standards is the key to boosting investor confidence and unlocking new markets for our people and has the unique opportunity to positioning itself as a leader in Africa’s halal economy—one that not only meets international standards but sets new benchmarks of excellence.

With Dar Al Halal Certification leading the charge, the future of Nigeria’s non-oil export looks brighter, and Nigerian exporters are better for it.",https://dailytrust.com/dar-al-halal-certification-your-gateway-to-a-us7-trillion-market-through-certification,https://dailytrust.com

Gov Yusuf receives separated conjoined twins after surgery in Saudi Arabia,"Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf of Kano State has received two Nigerian conjoined twins, Hassana and Husaina, who recently underwent a successful separation surgery in Saudi Arabia.

The twins returned home to a warm reception at Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport by a Saudi Arabian delegation.

The life-saving operation was carried out at the King Abdullah Specialist Children’s Hospital in King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, under the directives of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, and His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, Crown Prince and Prime Minister.

Daily Trust reports that Hassana and Husaina had traveled to Riyadh in October 2023, where they underwent months of comprehensive medical examinations.

Doctors discovered that the twins were joined at the lower abdomen, pelvis and spine, sharing vital structures that made the case particularly complex.

After careful planning, a multi-disciplinary team of 38 consultants and specialists, including experts in pediatric surgery, neurosurgery, orthopaedics, urology, anaesthesia, and plastic surgery, embarked on the delicate procedure.

The surgery, which unfolded in nine stages, lasted approximately 14 hours. Each stage required precise coordination to safely separate the twins and reconstruct their individual systems. The successful outcome was hailed as one of the most challenging yet rewarding achievements of the Saudi program for separating Siamese twins.

The Consular General of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in Kano, Khalil Ahmed Al-Admawi, who was present at the airport to welcome the family, described the success of the surgery as a demonstration of the Kingdom’s commitment to humanitarian service.

He added that, “Saudi Arabia would continue to extend medical assistance and goodwill to countries in need through King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre, especially Nigeria with which it shares historic ties.”

On his part, Kano State Governor while receiving them pledged to take full responsibility of their welfare, education and other social amenities.

The separation of Hassana and Husaina marks the 65th successful operation under the Saudi Siamese Twins Separation Program, which has provided care for 150 sets of conjoined twins from 25 countries over the past 35 years. The program has become one of the most prominent medical humanitarian initiatives globally, showcasing Saudi Arabia’s expertise in pediatric surgery and its dedication to supporting vulnerable families.",https://dailytrust.com/gov-yusuf-receives-separated-conjoined-twins-after-surgery-in-saudi-arabia,https://dailytrust.com

"Air Peace pilots test positive for alcohol, drugs — Report","The Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau (NSIB) has released its preliminary report, indicting an Air Peace pilot and a Co-pilot for taking hard drugs and alcohol.

The accident investigators tested the crew positive for the substances after the aircraft they flew was involved in a runway incursion at the Port Harcourt International Airport on July 13, 2025.

This was contained in a preliminary report signed by the Director of Public Affairs and Family Assistance at Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau, Mrs Bimbo Olawumi Oladeji, made available to Daily Trust.

SPONSOR AD

Daily Trust had reported how an Air Peace aircraft, on 13th June, 2925, had a runway incursion after landing at the Port Harcourt International Airport, carrying 103 passengers.

The aircraft veered off the runway without any damage.

An aircraft incursion is the wrongful or unauthorised positioning of an airplane at the runway.

The NSIB said, “The aircraft, operating as a scheduled domestic flight from Lagos to Port Harcourt with 103 persons on board, landed long on Runway 21 after an unstabilised final approach. The aircraft touched down 2,264 metres from the runway threshold and came to a final stop 209 metres into the clearway

“All passengers and crew disembarked safely, and no injuries were reported.”

According to the report, the domestic flight, which took off from Lagos, experienced an unstabilised final approach before landing long on Runway 21.

The NSIB revealed that the aircraft touched down 2,264 metres from the runway threshold, well beyond the recommended touchdown zone, and eventually came to a stop at 209 metres into the clearway. While all on board disembarked safely, the incident raised immediate safety concerns.

The preliminary reports say toxicological test results conducted on the flight crew turned out positive.

The Tests indicated the presence of alcohol in the system of the crew, while another crew member also tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active compound found in cannabis, colloquially referred to as “India hemp.”

The NSIB noted that these toxicology results were being assessed within the scope of human performance and safety management, both critical factors in aviation incident investigations.",https://dailytrust.com/air-peace-pilots-test-positive-for-alcohol-drugs-report,https://dailytrust.com
"Flood hits Abuja city, Katsina LG","Many roads in Abuja, the nation’s capital, were flooded following a heavy downpour in the early hours of yesterday.

Areas affected included Asokoro, Guzape, Jabi, Kado and Wuse.

Also, over 1,000 residents have been displaced and houses destroyed following devastating floods that swept through several communities in Kankia Local Government Area of Katsina State.

SPONSOR AD

In Abuja, many motorists, who spoke to Daily Trust, said they could access major roads in Abuja’s Asokoro and Guzape districts during the heavy downpour.

A video shared on Facebook by one Prince Adebisi Adetunji showed torrents of water covering parts of the road in Asokoro, leaving motorists and residents struggling to navigate the area.

The flood disrupted movement, with vehicles seen wading through deep waters.

Residents allege poor drainage

Residents in the area said the poor drainage system worsened the situation.

A motorist, Musa Ibrahim, told our reporter that many roads in the two districts were difficult to navigate, causing traffic jams.

Another driver, Emmanuel Peter, said he and others had to wait for a while before they could find a safer road the area.

“The FCT Administration needs to find a solution to the poor drainage system in the nation’s capital,” Peter said.

According to him, the issue is not limited to Asokoro or Guzape, but occurs in virtually all districts when it rains heavily.

“This also happens in Jabi, Wuse, and even the Central Business District every year.

“Something needs to be done by those managing the city to address the drainage issue,” he added.

A section of the Obafemi Awolowo Way in Jabi District was also flooded during the downpour.

Many motorists were seen navigating through the flooded section of the road.

Alhaji Nuhu Ademola said his car was stuck in the water at a junction close to Jabi Motor Park.

According to him, he spent close to 30 minutes before the water receded and was able to move out of his car.

Alhaji Ademola called on the FCT Administration to find a lasting solution to the poor drainage system within the nation’s capital.

‘’Of course, we don’t need to be telling them as they can also see it. How do you expect the nation’s capital to be built with a careful and well-planned drainage system,’’ he asked.

Another motorist, who also got stuck at the junction, Madam Evelyn Danjuma, said she had to park by the road side after seeing the volume of water on the main road.

She also attributed the incident to the poor drainage system and called on authorities to find ways of addressing the annual occurrence.

Mallam Awalu Dahiru, a driver who plies Kado to Airport Junction, said the road from the Kado roundabout was flooded during the road.

According to him, many vehicles were stuck under the bridge shortly after the roundabout at Kado.

‘’This happens on this road after every rain. We have been appealing to the FCT Administration to do something about this but nothing is being done,’’ he said.

Our correspondent reports that there was a similar flash flood at the Life Camp area of Abuja as well as at Wuse District.

Town planners speak

An Abuja-based town planner, Lami Ayuba, attributed the flash flood being experienced on major roads in Abuja to both natural and human factors.

She said towards the end of every rainy season, the intensity of the rain is so high that it is difficult for the ground to drain it, causing the water to overflow the drainages.

She also noted that improper waste disposal often leads to blockage of drainages.

She advised relevant FCT agencies responsible to waste evacuation to be alive to their responsibilities by promptly evacuating them.

She also called on such agencies to always ensure constant clearance of the drainages within the city centre.

She advocated deliberate sensitization programmes for residents on waste disposal.

This, she said, should be done alongside providing alternatives for disposing of their refuse.

Another town planner, Adeyemi Iyanda, also attributed the flash flood on major roads in Abuja to infractions to the masterplan of the city.

He cited illegal construction of structures on waterways, calling for immediate action from the FCT Development Control Department.

He also blamed residents for indiscriminate dumping of refuse on drainages.

He asked regulatory bodies to ensure that building laws are strictly adhered to.

He said people are now building on the waterways, leading to overflow whenever it rains.

According to him, the Development Control Department of the FCTA must intensify the monitoring and enforcement functions to check illegal buildings, especially those in flood prone areas.

The town planner also suggested regular clearing of debris from drains and ditches as well as cleaning downspouts and the gutters.

He charged the FCT Administration to educate the citizens on the need to stop indiscriminate buildings and refuse dumping on waterways.

FCTA removes structures on waterways

An official of the FCT Department of Development Control, who spoke to our reporter yesterday, said the FCT Administration had set up a special taskforce to clear illegal structures, especially those on waterways and in flood-prone areas.

According to the official, who craved anonymity, the Director of the Development Control Department, Muktar Galadima, is leading the taskforce.

He said the task force, which started removing some of those structures in Garki, Durumi and Wuse districts of the city.

He said the flash flood in the city could not be immediately or entirely stopped because of the long-time infractions to the masterplan.

He, however, noted that efforts would be made to address the situation.

A staff member of the FCT Emergency Management Department, who also wished to remain anonymous, said that aside from the poor drainage system, some residents also contribute to the problem.

1,000 people displaced, houses destroyed in Katsina

In Katsina, a heavy downpour accompanied by strong winds on Tuesday has displaced over 1,000 people in Kankia Local Government Area, after the Kankia dam overflowed, destroying hundreds of houses.

Residents said the disaster, worsened by the dam’s poor state, reduced many homes to rubble. Some victims now squat with relatives, while others remain stranded.

Though no lives were lost, families were seen salvaging belongings and moving to safer areas.

One victim, Adahama Rabe of Kofar Yamma, said her house collapsed with over 20 people inside.

She appealed for urgent government intervention, stressing that dredging the dam would solve much of the problem.

The Katsina State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) pledged immediate support, including temporary resettlement and relief materials. Its Executive Secretary, Binta Dangani, urged residents to clear waterways and heed environmental warnings to avert future disasters.

The flood also submerged the 40-year-old JIBWIS Mosque in Layi quarters, forcing worshippers to relocate Friday prayers to an alternative mosque.

Similar flooding was reported in Shinkafi, Unguwar Alkali, Makudawa and parts of Kwado, where many residents lost homes and livelihoods, prompting calls for urgent government support.

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) Kaduna Operations Office, in collaboration with the Katsina State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) and the Nigeria Red Cross, has launched a joint flood assessment to determine the full scale of the damage in Kankia LGA.

In a statement on Thursday, NEMA said many of the displaced residents have taken shelter at Tashan Lado Primary School near the Kankia Local Government Council Secretariat, with about 200 people currently living in a camp, temporarily provided by concerned authorities.

The statement also said the assessment team observed that hundreds of houses in the Sabon Duniya community were destroyed, with some completely collapsed, leaving many residents homeless.

“The assessment team is facing challenges accessing some severely affected communities as a result of an early-morning rainfall in the area, hindering efforts to determine the full extent of the damage.

“However, NEMA, SEMA, the Red Cross and delegated community elders are working round the clock to provide support for a hitch-free assessment of the incident.

“Meanwhile, evacuations are ongoing, with many people already rescued and provided with temporary shelter,” the statement added.",https://dailytrust.com/flood-hits-abuja-city-katsina-lg,https://dailytrust.com

This journey into Fulani heritage uncovers how the deep bond between cattle and culture has defined their history, sustained their communities, and preserved their unique traditions amid the pressures of modern change.

How to Easily Access the Buscador de Estatus de las Becas Benito Juárez,"In Mexico, where millions of young people face economic difficulties, the Becas Benito Juárez program, managed by the CNBBBJ, remains a pillar of educational equity. More than just financial relief, it is a symbol of opportunity for those who aspire to study despite obstacles.

This year, the program has evolved with new technological approaches: the emphasis on transparency has gained relevance thanks to the Buscador de Estatus, a key instrument for ensuring real-time access to and tracking of support.

What’s New in 2025: Registration, Payments, Cards and Key Figures

Expanded Registration and Updated Figures

This year’s registration window ran from January 8 to March 31, allowing new applicants to join with documents such as their CURP, proof of address, and school enrollment. The CNBBBJ is now serving more than 10 million students at the basic, upper-secondary and higher-education levels, cementing its place as one of Mexico’s largest social programs.

SPONSOR AD

Updated Calendar and Payment Amounts

Payments are made every two months, from January–February through November–December. In July and August, no payments are issued due to the summer holidays.

Approximate amounts by level:

Basic and upper-secondary education: $1,900 MXN

$1,900 MXN Higher education: $5,150 MXN

Delivery of Banco del Bienestar Cards

In 2025, the only authorized method to receive the scholarship is the Banco del Bienestar card. Its delivery began at the start of the year and is carried out gradually at temporary locations (schools, community centers) across various states.

It is essential to consult the Buscador de Estatus, as it indicates the date, place, and time to pick up the card, along with the required documents.

What the Buscador de Estatus Offers Today

This platform allows students and families to verify their participation in the Becas Benito Juárez program easily and free of charge using their CURP (or application number).

Among its most useful sections:

Banking Process: Shows a “traffic light” system of the card delivery process and appointment details with the Banco del Bienestar.

Detailed Status:

“Active,” “Under Review,” “Withdrawn,” “Not Registered” — each status comes with clear guidance on how to act and what steps to follow.

The Human Side Behind Each Status:

Every word generated by the Buscador de Estatus carries real emotional weight.

Active allows planning: “Yes, my daughter will receive the support,” many parents may think.

creates anticipation: additional documentation may be requested. Withdrawn or Not Registered trigger urgency and doubts; they compel the user to check for errors or go in person.

Thus, the Buscador de Estatus de las Becas Benito Juárez goes beyond being just an information channel. It is a tool that provides certainty amid uncertainty, connecting state action with the tangible needs of students.

Ongoing Challenge in Digital Equity

Indeed, improved access through the Buscador de Estatus also underlines a reality: digital inequality. There are some rural areas or areas in bad infrastructure that may have restrictions in terms of internet access or some kind of device.

This contrasts with the fact that many young people who most need the support live in these contexts, which underscores the need to complement the digital platform with on-site or mobile strategies in the field.

Conclusion

The renewed Buscador de Estatus de las Becas Benito Juárez represents a major step toward faster, more transparent, more human-centered public policy. Bi-monthly payments, exclusive use of the Banco del Bienestar card, and an updated platform all reflect one clear goal: making sure support arrives quickly, easily, and without middlemen.

But its impact goes beyond how many CURPs are entered. It’s a direct link between the State and the family. It’s the reassurance that a scholarship will come, the clarity of knowing when and where it will be delivered. Above all, it’s an ally in the fight against school dropout and inequality.

The challenge now is to ensure that this digital tool not only informs but also inspires and leaves a lasting mark on the educational experience of millions of students.",https://dailytrust.com/how-to-easily-access-the-buscador-de-estatus-de-las-becas-benito-juarez,https://dailytrust.com

Israeli attack on Qatar may open perilous chapter in Gaza conflict – UN official,"The Israeli attack on Qatar potentially opens a new and perilous chapter in the Gaza conflict, seriously threatening regional peace and stability.

Rosemary DiCarlo, UN Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs told the Security Council in a press conference.

DiCarlo said Israeli airstrikes in Doha, Qatar, on Tuesday shocked the world.

It was an alarming escalation, especially since it targeted individuals who were reportedly gathered to discuss the latest U.S. proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, she said.

The sovereignty and territorial integrity of any country, including Qatar, a valued partner in advancing peacemaking and conflict resolution, must be respected, she added.

“Qatar, along with Egypt and the United States, has been working intensively to broker a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza , efforts aimed at ending the suffering and paving a path toward peace,” she said.

“We are deeply grateful for Qatar’s steadfast commitment and constructive diplomacy. All parties must act to preserve these efforts.”

Regrettably, she said, Israel’s actions came at the height of ongoing consultations with the parties.

“Any action that undermines the work of mediation and dialogue weakens confidence in the very mechanisms the world depends on for conflict resolution.

“Preserving the integrity of negotiation and mediation channels is crucial for fostering the trust that parties need to engage in meaningful dialogue.

“It is also vital for safeguarding the norms that underpin diplomacy and peacemaking,” said DiCarlo.

Durable and just solutions to the crises in the Middle East will not come out of more violence and more fighting, she said.

She called on all stakeholders to exercise utmost restraint at this sensitive time and recommit to diplomacy.

“The urgency of a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza has never been greater,” she said. “Strike a deal. Free the hostages. End the suffering of the people of Gaza.” (Xinhua/NAN)",https://dailytrust.com/israeli-attack-on-qatar-may-open-perilous-chapter-in-gaza-conflict-un-official,https://dailytrust.com
"New tax laws will raise air fares, shrink passengers – Operators","The New Tax Laws which would take effect by January 2026 have continued to generate mixed reactions across various sectors with the aviation industry expressing concerns over the negative impact of the new tax laws in an already “struggling” industry.

According to the operators, especially the airlines and the aviation service providers, the tax laws appear to be “inordinate” with the progress of the industry.

Daily Trust reports that President Bola Tinubu has signed four tax bills into law. The bills are the Nigeria Tax Bill (Ease of Doing Business), which aims to consolidate Nigeria’s fragmented tax laws into a harmonised statute; the Nigeria Tax Administration Bill, which will establish a uniform legal and operational framework for tax administration across federal, state, and local governments.

SPONSOR AD

Others are the Nigeria Revenue Service (Establishment) Bill, which repeals the current Federal Inland Revenue Service Act and creates a more autonomous and performance-driven national revenue agency— the Nigeria Revenue Service (NRS); and the Joint Revenue Board (Establishment) Bill, which provides for a formal governance structure to facilitate cooperation between revenue authorities at all levels of government.

New tax laws and aviation industry

For the aviation industry, the new tax laws reinstated the payment of value added tax (VAT) on airline tickets, aircraft, aircraft engines and spare parts.

The Federal Government, as far back as 2018, had granted VAT waiver on airlines’ tickets as well as VAT on newly acquired aircraft and parts; the decision that the operators applauded.

But the new tax laws have quashed the exemptions, subjecting airlines to payment of VAT on tickets bought by passengers as well on aircraft, aircraft engines and spares.

Recently, the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) through its Vice-President, Mr. Allen Onyema said airlines would begin to fold up as soon as the new tax laws become operational.

“I don’t know who put it there, that we have to go back to the regime of paying custom duties for imported aircraft, custom duties for imported spare parts, VAT of 7.5% for imported aircraft, and even ticket fares. The airlines would die within 48 hours. Within 48 hours. But I am happy that the Minister of Aviation, Mr. Festus Keyamo, has taken it up because if it is ever implemented from January next year, airlines would die. They would just die. It has never been done anywhere before,” he said.

Defending the new tax laws, the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) stated that airlines are taxed like every other company in Nigeria.

Speaking at a webinar on Nigeria Tax Act 2025 and the Aviation Industry convened by the Aviation and Allied Business Publication, An Assistant Director, Tax Policy and advisory Department, Mrs. Nkechi Umegakwe insisted that the airline sector is a service sector.

According to her, the decision to bring back the VAT on air tickets was “a well-considered decision based on the principle of VAT neutrality.”

“VAT is a levy on the consumers, not the airline company. Airlines are agents of collection. The airline company doesn’t bear the burden of VAT,” she added.

IATA kicks

But the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Area Manager for West and Central Africa, Dr. Samson Fatokun who was at the webinar said there were already levies stipulated within the aviation ecosystem.

He stated that any levy being introduced outside those levies would be in contravention of the various international treaties and obligations including the Supplementary Act of 2024 which Nigeria has entered into.

He stressed the need for Nigeria to adjust the tax laws to align with the ECOWAS Supplementary Act of 2024 which was signed by President Tinubu when he was still the Chairman of ECOWAS.

He said, “The aviation industry is a global business, if I’m selling maybe spare parts in Nigeria for example, all my activities may be limited to Nigeria only and everything as laws and regulations made in Nigeria applies to me but in an international sphere, there are treaties that at times regulate global nature of that industry.

“The aviation industry is subject to those regulations and there are treaties already made that govern the global aviation industry even the economic side, financial and the taxation side there are already hundreds of treaties that have already been signed, and Nigeria is a member of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) which is an organ of the United Nations and Nigeria is a full member, Nigeria is subject also to regulations with regard to taxation of aviation that are being made by those organizations like ICAO.

“So Nigeria is bound to respect that because Nigeria carriers have been flying out and also we have foreign carriers flying here and they are touching several jurisdictions at the same time. So Nigeria has signed those standards and regulations that have been issued by ICAO that apply to taxation.

“We have international transportation, and also domestic transportation. The government said henceforth transportation of passengers will henceforth be subject to VAT and the global regulations which Nigeria is also part of is that international transportation of passengers cannot be taxed, it’s not subject to taxation, Nigeria had signed that, Nigeria approved that.”

He recalled that ECOWAS established the Supplementary Act of 14th December, 2024 that stated that “no taxation should be on any transportation of passengers or goods by air in ECOWAS Countries effective January 1st 2026.”

“That was signed by our President and other Presidents of ECOWAS. So our President cannot sign a Regional Act and our own internal legislation counters it. It doesn’t speak well of us,” he said.

VAT and TSC/CSC will amount to double taxation

Aviation Consultant, Capt. Samuel Caulcrick stated that the 7.5 per cent VAT payment would amount to double taxation with the existence of Ticket Sale Charge and Cargo Sale Charge (TSC/CSC) which he noted is already choking the industry.

“Aviation should not pay VAT as long as the five per cent TSC and CSC are still there. Those two are the major revenues that drive the industry, all other agencies are all cost recovery. Nobody is putting money, only the passengers and the cargo sector and they are being taxed. It would amount to double taxation to bring back the VAT. Aviation industry should be exempted from paying any charge until TSC, CSC are expunged. I wonder why during the construction of these Bills, nobody mentioned the TSC or CSC.”

Prof. Adua Mustapha, First Professor of Aviation Law in Nigeria stated that the FIRS, by virtue of sections 22 and 23 of the NCAA Act, should consider their stance on VAT.

“The provisions state that no taxation can be deducted from the income of the NCAA Act. If that should be the case, will that now mean that the Federal Inland Revenue Service will now have authority to tax the income of Nigeria Civil Aviation Act, I think they have to review provisions contradicting one another.

“I want to equally refer you to the provisions of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Act 2022, that Section 23 also in incongruous with the provision of the Federal inland Revenue Act, as it would amount to double taxation,” he added.

Mrs. Nkechi Onyeso, Chairperson of Institute of Chartered Secretaries Association of Nigeria (ICSAN) Aviation Sectoral Group said, “There is need for further engagement with stakeholders and core aviation practitioners. Aviation is already a struggling business. It is pretty tight for everyone. They have very low passengers as it is now. The impact of the introduction of VAT on tickets would impact passengers’ flow. There are standard costs the airline has to pay and passengers would be impacted and the VAT would worsen it.

“Aviation business is already going through a lot of challenges due to dollar impact because of the depreciation of the naira. Reintroducing VAT would be a way of promoting the aviation industry. The reform in the tax system is not a bad idea. Change is the only thing in life but there is a need for more stakeholders’ engagement to understand the impact.

Chief Executive Officer of Overland Airways, Capt. Edward Boyo lamented that the aviation industry is “facing adverse taxation that is inordinate with the progress of the country.”

“It appears that aviation is not considered a priority industry or a priority sector, though no fault of anyone but we are not priority but we need to be a priority. The country’s economy is going nowhere without stimulating its aviation industry.

“There is zero input from the technology level of Nigeria for the aviation Industry. Everything you see is produced outside and we are in a drive to domesticate a fair percentage of input so that jobs will be created for our own people…”",https://dailytrust.com/new-tax-laws-will-raise-air-fares-shrink-passengers-operators,https://dailytrust.com
Crude oil theft drops to 2.04 million barrels in 7 months – NUPRC,"The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) has stated that the federal government was able to contain crude oil theft to 9,600 barrels per day, totalling 2.04 million, from January to July 2025.

A statement by the commission said this is a 50 per cent reduction from the 4.1 million barrels lost at a daily average of 11,300 barrels in 2024 alone.

The statement said Nigeria’s upstream oil sector is witnessing a dramatic turnaround, with crude oil losses from theft and metering issues dropping to their lowest levels in nearly 16 years.

SPONSOR AD

It added that the 9,600 bpd loss is the lowest figure since 2009 when losses dropped to an all-time low of 8,500 bpd.

“This progress marks a major leap forward in the commission’s relentless drive to eliminate all forms of crude losses across Nigeria’s oilfields and pipelines. Between January and July 2025, crude oil losses were contained at 2.04 million barrels, averaging 9,600 barrels per day over the seven-month period. This marks a clear departure from the high-loss years that have long plagued the industry.”

“By comparison, the entire 2024 calendar year recorded 4.1 million barrels lost at a daily average of 11,300 barrels. Remarkably, in just the first seven months of 2025, losses were cut by 50.2%, with only 2.04 million barrels lost over the period.”

It added that the figures for the period ending July 2025 also represent a dramatic 94.57% drop in crude oil losses compared to the full year of 2021, when Nigeria lost a staggering 37.6 million barrels at a daily average of 102,900 barrels.

“So far in 2025, only 2.04 million barrels have been lost, which is a reduction of 35.56 million barrels compared to the 37.6 million barrels lost in 2021, underscoring the scale of progress made in just four years. Crude oil losses in 2021 were the highest recorded in nearly 23 years, making it the peak year between 2002 and July 2025.”

It added that since the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act in 2021, Nigeria has recorded steady progress in reducing crude oil losses but in 2021, losses stood at 37.6 million barrels, averaging 102,900 barrels per day and by 2022, this dropped to 20.9 million barrels at a daily average of 57,200 barrels.

“The downward trend continued in 2023, with losses reduced to 4.3 million barrels at 11,900 barrels per day. Even more progress was made in 2024, as losses were further contained to 4.1 million barrels, averaging 11,300 barrels per day.”

It said the commission has adopted a balanced mix of kinetic and non-kinetic strategies in tackling oil losses.

“On the kinetic front, the commission has continued to collaborate closely with security agencies, operators and communities. On the non-kinetic front, NUPRC has implemented strategic regulatory measures to close systemic loopholes. One key initiative is the metering audit across upstream facilities to ensure accurate measurement of production and exports.”

“To further strengthen control, the NUPRC under the leadership of Engineer Gbenga Komolafe approved 37 new crude oil evacuation routes to combat oil theft.”",https://dailytrust.com/crude-oil-theft-drops-to-2-04-million-barrels-in-7-months-nuprc,https://dailytrust.com
FG targets 30% power from renewable energy in 2030,"The Federal government has disclosed that it is targeting 30 per cent power generation from renewable energy sources by the year 2030.

Director General of the Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN), Dr. Mustapha Abdullahi, made the disclosure in Abuja on Thursday at the Green Skills Bootcamp which had as the theme: “Spark the Green Economy,”

Speaking at the event, the ECN DG noted that Nigeria was the first African country to develop a National Energy Transition Master Plan which is a roadmap to net zero.

He added that around 90 million Nigerians do not have access to electricity, even though 140 million do. That is a huge gap. The United Nations has mandated energy security for all, and our current president is committed to ensuring every Nigerian has access to clean, reliable, and affordable electricity.

Last year, the Energy Commission unveiled the first gazetted National Energy Policy, along with the National Energy Master Plan, signed by the president in May 2024. This was not just another policy document. The president directed that Nigeria’s energy mix must change. By 2030, 30 percent must come from renewables, scaling up further so that by 2060, we can achieve net zero,” the DG said

Also speaking, Oladimeji Olawale, CEO, Sleekabyte Technologies, UK Ltd noted that the project being launched called the RoboVolts, is designed to make a real impact for MSMEs, which form the backbone of Nigeria’s economy.

“With fuel prices rising sharply over the past 18 months, our solution offers them a cheaper, cleaner alternative to diesel and petrol generators. This will cut costs and boost profits. We are training MSMEs and integrating AI into our system to help map generator use in communities, giving government data to phase out fossil fuel generators and transition to sustainable alternatives,” he explained Similarly, Abdul-Quayyum Gbadamosi, CEO of CitiBIM Nigeria Ltd stated that there is a need for deliberate shift to renewable energy by businesses, adding that the company has overtime keyed into different programmes that will boost MSMEs sustainability through the adoption of renewable energy.",https://dailytrust.com/fg-targets-30-power-from-renewable-energy-in-2030,https://dailytrust.com
"Customs in Apapa rakes in N20bn in 1 day, Onne generates N476bn","The Apapa Customs Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has achieved the collection of N20.1 billion in a single day, surpassing the previous highest daily collection of N18 billion.

The success can be attributed to the effective implementation of the Unified Customs Management System, also known as B’Odogwu.

Superintendent of Customs, John Tunde Ayagbalo, Public Relations Officer for the Command, in a statement put the actual collection at N20,156,077,098.56 as of Tuesday September 9, 2025, barely 24 hours after the Comptroller assumed leadership of the area.

SC Ayagbalo disclosed that the collection now stands as the highest daily revenue of any command in the Nigeria Customs Service using the Unified Customs Management System, also known as B’Odogwu.

On the recent N20.1b collection in a day, Comptroller Oshoba said it’s only the beginning of greater exploits and it’s not time for celebration because he foresees greater achievements for the flagship command of NCS under his leadership.

He described B’Odogwu as a necessity in the build-up to a more modern and efficient customs administration in Nigeria with potential to strengthen the country’s position as Africa’s largest economy noted for trade facilitation.

Meanwhile, the Nigeria Customs Service, has said that the area 11 command Command of the service has generated a total sum of N476 billion between January to August 2025.

He said: “For this year 2025, my target is N700 billion, as at the end of August, we had already generated N476 billion. This feat is a testament to hard work and dedication of officers and men.

“2024 was one of the best years concerning revenue generation. My revenue target last year was N618 billion, but we generated N639 billion.

“So far, more than N1.6 trillion has been generated under my leadership, my job was not limited to revenue generation, it also covers trade facilitation too.

"Mark, Aregbesola remain ADC leaders as court rejects suit","A Federal High Court in Abuja has declined an application seeking to restrain former Senate President David Mark and ex-Osun State Governor Rauf Aregbesola from parading themselves as national chairman and secretary of the African Democratic Congress (ADC).

The crisis stems from the recent adoption of ADC as the coalition platform for the 2027 general elections at an event attended by prominent politicians, including former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and former governors Peter Obi, Rotimi Amaechi and Nasir El-Rufai, alongside ex-ministers and lawmakers. Since then, the party has been locked in leadership disputes.

The ADC’s 2019 presidential candidate, Dumebi Kachikwu, had described the adoption as a “hostile takeover” that disregarded due process, while other aggrieved members went to court to challenge it.

SPONSOR AD

A former ADC governorship candidate in Gombe State, Nafiu Bala, went further to declare himself factional national chairman. He subsequently approached the court seeking to stop the new leadership from functioning.

However, Justice Emeka Nwite, in court documents dated September 10, rejected the application but ordered Mark, Aregbesola, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and ADC founder Ralph Nwosu to appear before the court to show cause why the application should not be granted.

The judge also directed Bala, a former deputy national chairman of the party, to put the defendants on notice before the next hearing fixed for September 15.

In his originating summons, Bala sought an interim injunction restraining Mark and Aregbesola from acting as chairman and secretary until he convenes a meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) to fill the positions vacated by national officers who resigned in July.

Through his counsel, Michael Agber, Bala also asked the court to restrain Nwosu from “recognising, dealing with, or continuing to deal with the 2nd defendant (Mark) and 3rd defendant (Aregbesola) as national chairman and national secretary of the 1st defendant (ADC), whose purported emergence… is ultra vires the constitution of the 1st defendant (ADC).”

Party faults misleading reports

Earlier on Thursday, some media outlets (not Daily Trust) reported that the court had restrained Mark and Aregbesola, relying only on the first page of Bala’s ex parte motion, which contained his prayers.

But a full copy of the court order obtained by Daily Trust confirmed that the court in fact refused the application. The document emerged less than 24 hours after INEC formally recognised the new ADC leadership, nearly two months after a coalition of opposition parties adopted the platform and assumed control of its structures. Reacting in a statement titled “No Injunction Granted Against David Mark and Rauf Aregbesola”, ADC described the reports as “#FakeNews and last resort of desperate political jobbers.”

The National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi, said contrary to misleading claims, the court ruling delivered on September 4 by Justice Nwite clearly stated that the plaintiff’s application filed on September 2 was refused.

He said, having failed to stop INEC from recognising the leadership change, “political jobbers are now resorting to fake news, misrepresenting court rulings in their desperate effort to sow confusion and undermine opposition parties.”

Abdullahi urged the media and the public to be wary of fake reports allegedly engineered by destabilisation agents linked to the ruling party.

Analyst sees political merchants at work

Commenting on the dispute, political analyst and development consultant Jide Ojo described the crisis as the handiwork of “political merchants” bent on distracting the ADC coalition ahead of 2027.

He told Daily Trust that the party could face a prolonged legal battle designed to weaken it as a credible opposition platform.

“Obviously, there are political interest groups that do not want ADC to pose any serious threat in 2027. The whole motive is to distract its promoters,” Ojo said.

He recalled that the earlier plan to float the African Democratic Alliance (ADA) failed after INEC withheld recognition, forcing opposition leaders to adopt the ADC. “But when you get involved in a political hijack of this nature, there will always be competing interests,” he noted.

Ojo added that figures like Dumebi Kachikwu could also be exploiting the crisis or acting at the behest of external political forces.

“The resort to court by some people may actually be a strategy to destabilise both ADC and the wider opposition. There are political merchants who profit from such crises, and there are always sponsors willing to fund them. They often use party members as fronts to weaken the platform from within,” he said.",https://dailytrust.com/mark-aregbesola-remain-adc-leaders-as-court-rejects-suit,https://dailytrust.com

Mikel Obi wants NFF dissolved if Super Eagles miss 2026 W’Cup,"A former Super Eagles captain, John Mikel Obi, has urged the Federal Government to dissolve the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) if the national team fails to qualify for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Speaking on the Obi One Podcast, the ex-Chelsea midfielder criticised the NFF for what he described as poor leadership and disorganisation, which he blamed for Nigeria’s struggles in the ongoing qualifiers.

“I feel for the people of my country. I feel for the people of Nigeria because they are going to be devastated right now. Again for the second time running we are not going to qualify for the World Cup.

“If we don’t make it to the World Cup, the whole board of the NFF—they need to go. They need to go. Sorry, they have to go if we don’t qualify for the World Cup,” he said.

Mikel recalled Nigeria’s failure to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and warned that history may repeat itself.

“We didn’t qualify for Qatar, and now it looks like again we are not going to make it. Honestly, I have nothing to say about it.

“I am saying it right now—they must go because it’s not acceptable. Twice we didn’t qualify for the World Cup. We are the biggest footballing country in Africa.

“I don’t care what anybody says—Mo Salah, Egypt, whatever. Nigeria is the biggest football nation in Africa. A drastic change has to be made.

"NPFL giants, Enugu Rangers, relish partnership with Afrinvest","The General Manager of Rangers International Football Club, Amobi Ezeaku, has described the club’s partnership with Afrinvest West Limited partnership as a turning point that has reshaped the “Flying Antelopes” fortunes both on and off the pitch.

It could be recalled that the Enugu-based club signed a shirt sponsorship with the financial firm in 2023.

Speaking at the firm’s 30th anniversary in Lagos, Ezeaku underscored the importance of the club’s sponsorship, stressing the deal was a huge trust and an affirmation of belief in the club.

SPONSOR AD

“For us at Rangers International FC, this celebration carries a special significance. In 2023, Afrinvest extended a hand of partnership to Rangers. That gesture was more than sponsorship, it was an affirmation of belief,” he said.

According to him, the firm’s support demonstrated belief in the power of sports to transform society, in the heritage and future of Rangers International, and in the dreams of millions of fans.

He noted that the outcome of the partnership has been far-reaching, attributing it as a critical enabler to lift the 2023/2024 NPFL title and expand the club’s administrative and business potentials.

“The collaboration also opened doors to additional sponsorships, strengthened the club’s digital presence, and birthed the Rangers Foundation and Rangers Academicals, initiatives focused on grassroots football and youth development.

“Further, the club created new pathways for players to reach national teams while enhancing its organizational structure, from upgraded offices to professional systems that ensure sustainability.

“All these milestones speak to one truth: Afrinvest’s decision to stand with Rangers has been transformative,” he said.

Ezeaku, therefore, congratulated the firm’s 30 years of impact, expressing confidence that the partnership will inspire generations to come.",https://dailytrust.com/npfl-giants-enugu-rangers-relish-partnership-with-afrinvest,https://dailytrust.com
3SC realise over N6m from ticket sales in draw against Ikorodu City,"Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) side Shooting Stars Sports Club (3SC) have disclosed that they made more than N6.6 million from ticket sales during their Matchday 3 clash with Ikorodu City, which ended 1-1 at the Lekan Salami Stadium, Ibadan.

The “Oluyole Warriors” announced that they sold 8,425 tickets for the fixture at the 10,000-capacity ground, making it one of their best-attended home games in recent years.

The breakdown showed 171 VVIP tickets at N5,000, 1,097 VIP tickets at N2,000, and 7,157 regular tickets at N500, generating a total revenue of N6,627,500.

SPONSOR AD

This marks the first time a Nigerian club has publicly released detailed revenue figures from matchday ticket sales, a move attributed to recent reforms in the club’s management. In a statement, 3SC expressed gratitude to their supporters.

“A big thank you to our incredible supporters for showing up in numbers on Matchday 3. With 171 VVIP, 1,097 VIP, and 7,157 regular tickets sold, you made the Lekan Salami Stadium electric. Your passion keeps us going, and together we’ll achieve more.” The strong turnout comes as the Ibadan giants, now under new coach Nurudeen Aweroro, continue their push to end a trophy drought stretching back to 1998. Despite failing to secure all three points, the club said the fans’ loyalty and financial backing will play a crucial role in their campaign.

Meanwhile, NPFL clubs have been warned to desist from taking part in any youth competition not approved by the league board.

In a statement issued yesterday, the NPFL directed clubs to withdraw from the “so-called N-Youth League,” stressing that the competition has no affiliation with the topflight.

According to the board, the NPFL already runs an official youth league, and allowing elite clubs to feature in unapproved tournaments would undermine its credibility.

“There is the NPFL Youth League, which is active. It will amount to demarketing it for clubs in the top division to take part in such alongside lower division and amateur teams,” the statement read.

The board further emphasized that it remains the only body authorized by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to organize youth leagues for NPFL clubs, warning teams to strictly adhere to this directive.",https://dailytrust.com/3sc-realise-over-n6m-from-ticket-sales-in-draw-against-ikorodu-city,https://dailytrust.com

Why Africa’s biggest dam is ruffling feathers along Nile River,"On Tuesday, Ethiopia officially inaugurated the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Africa’s largest hydroelectric project, marking the end of a 14-year construction journey and the beginning of a new chapter in Nile Basin geopolitics.

The dam, built on the Blue Nile near the Sudanese border, is designed to generate over 5,000 megawatts of electricity, enough to power millions of homes and transform Ethiopia into a regional energy hub.

Towering at 175 meters high and stretching 1,800 meters wide, GERD stands as Africa’s largest dam, with a reservoir capable of holding up to 74 billion cubic meters of water, more than the volume of Lake Tana, Ethiopia’s largest lake.

SPONSOR AD

However, while Addis Ababa celebrated the milestone with fanfare and regional allies, the ceremony was noticeably boycotted by Egypt and Sudan, whose longstanding concerns over water security remain unresolved.

For Ethiopia, GERD is more than an infrastructure project. It is a symbol of sovereignty, resilience, and ambition. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, speaking at the inauguration, described the dam as “a great achievement not only for Ethiopia but for all Africans,” emphasising that it was built to uplift economies, not to harm neighbours.

The dam was financed almost entirely through domestic sources, including bond sales and grassroots fundraising, reinforcing its status as a national triumph.

Located on the Blue Nile, the source of the bulk of the Nile’s downstream water, has made it a flashpoint in regional diplomacy. Egypt, which depends on the Nile for more than 90% of its freshwater, views the dam as an existential threat.

Cairo fears that the filling and operation of the dam could reduce water flow, disrupt agriculture, and exacerbate water scarcity during droughts. Sudan, while initially optimistic about flood control and energy benefits, has grown increasingly wary of the dam’s safety and the lack of coordination, especially after experiencing erratic water levels during earlier filling phases.

Hydropower, irrigation, and politics of water

The Nile River, which runs for 6,650 kilometres, is shared by 11 countries: Burundi, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.

The GERD dispute has been marked by years of stalled negotiations, failed mediation efforts, and clashing legal interpretations.

Egypt and Sudan have consistently called for a binding agreement to govern the dam’s filling schedule and operational protocols.

Ethiopia, however, has resisted such constraints, arguing that it has a sovereign right to develop its water resources without external interference.

Talks brokered by the African Union, the United States, and the United Nations have yielded no breakthrough.

In July 2025, Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty declared the end of negotiations, citing Ethiopia’s unilateral actions and accusing it of violating international law.

Kenya’s President William Ruto has since offered to mediate, but progress remains elusive.

At the heart of the impasse is the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement, which allocated 66% of the river’s flow to Egypt and 22% to Sudan, excluding Ethiopia entirely.

Addis Ababa rejects the treaty as a colonial relic, arguing that it does not reflect modern realities or the rights of upstream nations. This clash of legal frameworks has hardened positions and made compromise difficult.

Beyond the immediate water concerns, GERD has wider implications for regional stability and development. If managed cooperatively, the dam could serve as a model for shared infrastructure, powering industries across East Africa and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

Ethiopia has already begun exporting surplus electricity to neighbouring countries, positioning itself as a key player in the continent’s energy future.

But if left unresolved, the dispute could deepen mistrust, fuel nationalist rhetoric, and destabilise an already fragile region. Climate change adds urgency to the equation, with unpredictable rainfall and rising demand threatening to intensify competition over water resources.

Experts warn that unilateral actions could trigger a race to the bottom, where short-term national interests override long-term sustainability.

Civil society groups have called for greater transparency, environmental assessments, and inclusive dialogue. The African Union, as a continental body, has a critical role to play in facilitating these conversations and ensuring that development does not come at the expense of justice.

As the waters of the Blue Nile surge through GERD’s turbines, the dam stands as both a triumph and a test, a monument to Ethiopia’s aspirations and a mirror reflecting the region’s unresolved tensions.

Analysts say whether it becomes a beacon of cooperation or a source of conflict will depend on the choices made in the months ahead.",https://dailytrust.com/why-africas-biggest-dam-is-ruffling-feathers-along-nile-river,https://dailytrust.com
"South Sudan vice-president charged with murder, crimes against humanity","South Sudan’s Vice-President Riek Machar has been charged with murder, treason and crimes against humanity over an attack by an ethnic militia on a military base that killed more than 250 soldiers, the justice minister said Thursday.

A fragile power-sharing agreement between President Salva Kiir and his first vice-president, Machar, has been unravelling for months in the world’s youngest country.

In early March, a militia from Machar’s ethnic Nuer community, known as the White Army, attacked a military base in Nasir County, Upper Nile State, in the northeast of the country.

SPONSOR AD

The government said Machar was responsible and has now charged him and 20 others with murder, conspiracy, terrorism, treason, destruction of public property and crimes against humanity.

“These crimes were marked by gross violations of the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law, including the desecration of corpses, persecution of civilians, and attacks on humanitarian workers,” Justice Minister Joseph Geng Akech said, according to a read-out provided to reporters in Juba.

Kiir soon after issued a presidential decree stripping Machar of his government position, along with another co-accused, petroleum minister Puot Kang Choi, according to a statement on state television.

The military base in Nasir was overrun by the White Army between March 3 and 7.

Several senior officers, including a general, died, and a United Nations helicopter came under fire while attempting to rescue soldiers at the base, leading to the death of a pilot.

“This case sends a clear message: those who commit atrocities against the people of South Sudan, against our armed forces, and against humanitarian personnel will be held accountable, no matter their position or political influence,” the minister said in the statement.

Kiir had already been moving for months to consolidate power and sideline Machar, who was placed under house arrest a few weeks after the attack, while many of his allies have also been detained.

South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 but was quickly plunged into a devastating five-year civil war between Kiir and Machar that left some 400,000 dead. The war ended with a power-sharing agreement in 2018, but attempts by the international community to ensure a democratic transition have failed.

Israel’s strike on Qatar ‘criminal’ – Ambassador Dahiru,"A former Nigerian diplomat, Ambassador Suleiman Dahiru, has condemned Israel’s recent airstrike on Doha, the capital of Qatar, describing it as “criminal” and a deliberate attempt to sabotage peace efforts in the Middle East.

In an interview with Daily Trust, Dahiru, who served Nigeria across several countries, including in the Middle East, said the attack, which Israel claimed targeted senior Hamas negotiators, was a vindication of his long-held view that Israel operates “like a lawless country – behaving as a loose cannon.”

“Now, your question is whether I stand by what I have been saying about Israel as a lawless country. And I want to confirm that what Israel did yesterday (on Tuesday) by attacking Doha has confirmed everything.”

SPONSOR AD

The ambassador expressed outrage that the United States, which had assured Qatar of protection for Hamas negotiators, failed to prevent the strike.

“It is criminal, I repeat, it is criminal for Israel to do what it did. America confirmed that it had been alerted by Israel of the attack, but it didn’t prevent Israel from carrying it out.” He accused the US of enabling Israel’s aggression, stating, “America is not an honest broker of peace in the Middle East. America is blindly supporting Israel, behaving like a poodle of Israel.”

Dahiru warned that violence against Hamas would only fuel further resistance. “Any day you kill one Hamas, another Hamas is born.

“There is no way the Palestinians will continue to tolerate the egregious behaviour of Israel,” he said. On the implications, he lamented the Arab world’s failure to stand firmly with Palestine. “The Arab world has disappointed Palestine. And they have also disappointed the Muslim world. “Why should some Arab countries establish diplomatic relations with Israel? They are afraid of America.”

He praised Iran for resisting Western pressure, saying, “The only country that has commendably refused to kowtow to America and Israel is Iran.”",https://dailytrust.com/israels-strike-on-qatar-criminal-ambassador-dahiru,https://dailytrust.com
Trump deports first set of Nigerians through Ghana,"The first set of Nigerians deported from the US through Ghana have arrived West Africa.

President John Dramani Mahama of Ghana disclosed this to reporters late Wednesday.

“A group of 14 deportees including Nigerians and one Gambian have already arrived in Ghana, and the government facilitated their return to their home countries,” Mahama said at a press conference.

He said Ghana had already facilitated the return of the Nigerians to their country by bus while the Gambian was still being assisted to return home.

“We were approached by the US to accept third-party nationals who were being removed from the US. And we agreed with them that West African nationals were acceptable,” Mahama said.

“All our fellow West African nationals don’t need visas to come to our country.”

Mahama described Ghana-US relations as a “tightening situation”, citing the hiked US tariffs on Ghanaian goods and visa restrictions on its nationals.

He however said relations remained positive.

The Trump administration has approached a number of African countries to accept deportees as part of its push to deter immigration.

Some of those deported have been citizens of countries such as Jamaica, Vietnam and Laos, with rights groups arguing that this violated their basic rights.

Some countries have pushed back against the deportation strategy.

Nigeria, which has been a vocal opponent, has previously said it would not bow to pressure to accept third-country migrants from the US.

The Trump administration has approached a number of African governments about accepting deportees as part of its campaign to deter immigration through high-profile deportations to so-called “third countries.”

Embedding forensic protocols into the operations of governance,"In Nigeria’s governance landscape, promises often echo louder than tangible outcomes. Budgets are passed with great anticipation, policies announced with confident flair, and projects launched with ribbon-cutting fanfare. Yet, more often than not, the outcomes fail to match the optimism. What has long been missing in the machinery of government is not good intentions but verifiable accountability. A system where every Naira spent is linked to measurable progress. A system where public confidence is earned through evidence, not just oratory.

This credibility gap is not accidental, and it is far from new. In 2023, the Office of the Auditor-General for the Federation (AuGF) reported that over N300 billion remained unaccounted for across federal government Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs). In the same year, Transparency International ranked Nigeria 140th out of 180 countries on its Corruption Perception Index, despite the existence of fiscal laws and oversight mechanisms. By 2024, the national budget had crossed N27 trillion, but many states still struggle to complete even 30 per cent of their capital projects on time or within budget.

It is not the absence of legal instruments that sustains this dysfunction. Nigeria’s Public Procurement Act and Fiscal Responsibility Act are robust on paper, but enforcement remains weak. Too often, agencies submit compliance reports without supporting evidence, announce project milestones without scrutiny, and issue audit certificates that lack rigorous verification. The gap lies in institutional capacity to interrogate and verify precisely the gap that institutional forensics is designed to fill.

SPONSOR AD

We need a shift from paper-based oversight to science-based governance. This is where institutional forensics comes in. Rather than waiting for mismanagement to occur before action is taken, forensic governance embeds early detection, digital verification, and evidence-based review into the fabric of public service. It equips institutions not only to detect failures but to prevent them.

Across sectors, the need for this forensic approach is growing more urgent. Procurement fraud continues to plague development efforts, with inflated contracts and duplicate payments still recurring. Investigations into payroll fraud in several MDAs have uncovered thousands of ghost workers. The Fiscal Responsibility Commission, in its recent compliance review, highlighted over 100 agencies that failed to submit annual financial statements, a legal obligation. Meanwhile, cyber fraud in Nigeria cost over $500 million in 2022 alone, with weak systems making it easier to manipulate or mask digital trails.

To break this cycle, accountability must be embedded into the lifecycle of public expenditure. Projects should not merely be evaluated after implementation. They must undergo continuous, forensic monitoring from the planning stage through execution and reporting. Ministries that handle high-volume funds such as Works, Health, Defence, and Education, should have dedicated forensic units integrated into their internal operations. These units, staffed by certified experts, would examine procurement records, verify deliverables, and track fund flows in real time.

In addition, Nigeria must invest in and support the development of operational forensic laboratories and technical spaces equipped to examine documents, inspect digital records, test construction quality, and assess compliance. These labs should not exist in isolation, but form part of a national framework that supports real-time oversight. When matched with legislative backing and executive support, such an architecture would shift the country from performative audits to preventive controls.

Lessons from other nations underscore the urgency. In Chile and South Korea, forensic auditing and digital traceability have been institutionalised within the public finance system. Estonia, for instance, uses blockchain technology to track every transaction and ensure that public data remains tamper-proof. These innovations were not responses to crisis; they were proactive strategies to embed trust into governance.

Fortunately, Nigeria has made some progress, institutions like the Chartered Institute of Forensics and Certified Fraud Investigators of Nigeria (CIFCFIN), have trained a new generation of forensic professionals, with pilot forensic audits conducted in partnership with the Office of the Auditor-General for the Federation (AuGF), and the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) to expand its capacity for contract oversight. What is now required is a unified push to scale these initiatives nationally, with mandates for forensic reporting built into major public programmes.

This must be a top-down and bottom-up reform. Federal and state governments should mandate that all projects above a certain threshold, say N100 million, are subject to forensic oversight. Reports should be independently certified and published in a centralized database accessible to oversight institutions and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs). Furthermore, agencies should be compelled to present annual forensic compliance reports alongside their budget submissions. This would link future allocations to past performance, creating a feedback loop that rewards transparency and penalizes opacity.

I dare say that this is not about reinventing the wheel but about the will to act, instill professional integrity, and unwavering commitment to evidence-based governance. Without this, Nigeria will continue to suffer resource leakages, delay development, and disappoint its citizens. Indeed, a government that cannot verify its own performance cannot inspire confidence and a system that lacks forensic traceability will always be vulnerable to manipulation.

I want to state plainly that what is ultimately at stake is more than public funds; it is public trust. In an era of increasing fiscal strain and development urgency, promises are no longer enough. Nigerians deserve a governance system that tracks, measures, and delivers and a government that does not merely announce, but can prove. The future belongs to those who can back their words with facts, their budgets with results, and their intentions with verifiable action.

The path forward is clear. We must embed forensic protocols into the daily operations of governance. Not as an emergency response, but as a standard operating procedure. Not as a tool of punishment, but as a preventive measure. Not as a cosmetic reform, but as a foundational shift. This is how we can surely move from promises to proof, and from paper accountability to tangible progress.

Nigeria can no longer afford the luxury of guessing. It must know, with certainty; it must track, with precision; it must verify, with evidence. Only then can we in good conscience say that accountability has taken root.

Tinubu’s debt trap: Who pays tomorrow?,"Our country, Nigeria is in its economic journey under President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The mounting debt profile of his administration, built on an already precarious fiscal foundation left by his predecessors, raises urgent questions about sustainability, intergenerational equity, and the future of national development. While borrowing can be a legitimate tool for economic growth, the scale, speed, and opacity of Nigeria’s current debt accumulation risk shackling future generations with obligations they did not choose, for benefits they may never see.

In 2015, when late President Buhari assumed office, Nigeria’s total public debt stood at N12.12 trillion. By the time he left in May 2023, that figure had soared to N77 trillion, a staggering 535 per cent increase. Even more troubling is the structure of this debt: much of it was directed toward recurrent spending rather than productive investments. Nigeria’s external debt ballooned from $10.31 billion to $43.16 billion, with significant portions allocated to budget support and debt servicing rather than capital formation.

Then, enter President Tinubu, whose early tenure has not deviated from this debt-heavy trajectory. In just his first year, Nigeria’s public debt surpassed N100 trillion, representing an increase of over N24 trillion—nearly one-third of Buhari’s total debt over eight years. Major facilities include a $1.5 billion loan from the World Bank and a $1 billion Eurobond and many more, ostensibly for infrastructure and budgetary support. If this trajectory continues unchecked, the national debt could breach N150 trillion by 2027.

SPONSOR AD

Such rapid accumulation raises fundamental questions: What exactly are we borrowing for? Who is monitoring the outcomes? And, most importantly, who will pay the price?

The implications are not abstract. Nigeria’s population is overwhelmingly young, over 70 per cent are under the age of 30. Every billion Naira borrowed today becomes a liability for these young Nigerians, many of whom already face bleak employment prospects, inadequate public services, and fragile social infrastructure.

The debt repayment does not occur in a vacuum. It manifests in higher taxes, reduced fiscal space, cuts to social services, and inflationary pressures. For a country where public sector salaries, fuel subsidies, and debt servicing already swallow the bulk of government revenue, the margin for meaningful investment in education, healthcare, and innovation is rapidly eroding. In 2023, a shocking 96 per cent of Nigeria’s federal revenue went to servicing debt. This is not just unsustainable, it is reckless.

Compounding the debt dilemma is the issue of regional imbalance in the distribution of debt-financed projects. Nigeria’s federal character demands an equitable spread of development to promote national cohesion. Yet, evidence suggests a disproportionate concentration of federally-funded infrastructure in select areas, particularly Lagos and a few other urban centres.

Lagos has seen significant investments in rail lines, port expansions, and road infrastructure. While these may be economically justifiable, there are needs for comparable investments in other regions, particularly the Niger Delta and the insurgency-hit North East, areas that contribute substantially to national revenue or are in dire need of rebuilding. Such spatial inequality in the deployment of public investment not only undermines national unity but also defeats the purpose of borrowing in the name of “national development.” Any borrowing done in the name of Nigeria should reflect federal character in infrastructural development. It is not right for populations that have not benefited from borrowed funds to be made to pay for them, whether through taxation or otherwise. I am of the opinion that, any loan or borrowed funds by either states or central governments should be reasonably repayable within our lifetime, so as to avoid indebting the next generation of Nigerians.

A democracy is only as accountable as its institutions are empowered. In Nigeria, however, debt procurement is increasingly shrouded in opacity. Loan terms especially with respect to interest rates, collateral agreements, and repayment timelines are often not disclosed to the public. This raises fears of “hidden debts” with punitive consequences, as seen in other African countries that fell into the trap of opaque bilateral loans, particularly from China.

The National Assembly, constitutionally mandated to scrutinise loan requests, often rubber-stamps executive proposals with little or no rigorous debate. This democratic deficit erodes public trust and opens the door to mismanagement or abuse. The Debt Management Office (DMO), though competent, lacks the enforcement teeth to halt unwise borrowing when political interests override economic logic.

To avoid tumbling further into a debt abyss, Nigeria must urgently recalibrate its fiscal and borrowing strategy. Borrowing must align with the country’s actual revenue-generating capacity. Debt servicing should not exceed 30 per cent of government revenue a target already breached. Laws should be enacted or enforced to institutionalise such ceilings.

More importantly, borrowing should be tied strictly to projects with clear, measurable economic returns; power generation, railways, agro-industrial corridors not for consumption or recurrent expenditure. All loans should be subjected to pre-and post-impact assessments. The Constitution or a new fiscal responsibility act should enshrine a needs-based project distribution formula, factoring in population size, revenue contribution, and infrastructure deficits. This will ensure that no region feels excluded or shortchanged.

Citizens must also be empowered to track public borrowing and its impact. This can be done through simplified fiscal reports, regular debt scorecards, and budget town halls. A more informed populace is a more demanding and responsible electorate.

Nigeria is not alone in navigating the perils of sovereign debt. Ghana’s recent economic meltdown, driven by excessive Eurobond borrowing, led to a sovereign default, harsh IMF conditions, and deep public discontent. On the other hand, Indonesia’s post-Asian crisis recovery offers useful lessons. By combining strategic borrowing with strong fiscal discipline, infrastructure investment, and export diversification, Indonesia not only stabilised its economy but emerged stronger.

Nigeria must choose wisely: emulate countries that use debt as a lever for progress, or follow those that stumbled into financial servitude.

President Tinubu still has a chance to reverse course and define a legacy rooted in prudence, not profligacy. Tinubu himself a trained accountant should champion a generational accounting framework that evaluates every loan against its long-term impact on future Nigerians. This requires strengthening institutions like the DMO, depoliticising project selection, and utilising the newly reformed tax laws to boost domestic revenue without overburdening the poor ‘let the poor breath’.

President Tinubu must also heed the warnings of history. The path of unchecked borrowing is littered with examples of economies brought to their knees, currencies collapsed, and governments forced into humiliating bailouts.

Leadership is not measured merely by roads built or terminals commissioned today, but by the economic freedom preserved for tomorrow. Nigeria’s youth brimming with potential, energy, and hope, I think deserve more than to inherit a nation bogged down by compound interest and unfulfilled promises.

The question is no longer whether Nigeria can borrow more. It is whether Nigeria should, and at what cost. If Nigeria continues this way, the answer to “Who pays tomorrow?” will be painfully clear: the very people who never had a say in today’s decisions.

On good governance and accountability: Recipes for rescuing Nigeria (II),"“But an active despair has often triumphed over the assurance of indolent success”, Edward Gibbon

The sense of active despair is the only resort that Nigerians are left with, to exhibit their repudiation of their state of anonymity and conditions of restless search for solutions to their pathetic and abject nothingness. Having been reduced to the state of a herd owned by the masters of the country, the only course left for Nigerians is to cultivate the awareness that there are options available to them to bring about a change in their fortunes and conditions of debasement by successive regimes of uncoordinated and unresponsive governments.

According to globally established standards of effective governance, the ability to respond to emergencies and crisis at speed and scale is a critical measurement of the success of a country’s establishment. How ours is faring in the face of myriads of challenges is an open testament to what is generally lacking in our system. Good and accountable governance also entails the setting of clear goals and targets for the development of human and natural resources of the country as indicated by global best practices. This requires that there should be in place systems and processes towards securing the country and all its people and resources from unwarranted exploitation and overbearing influences of negative types.

In other properly functioning countries, where the citizens are accorded respect and treated not as herds but as the vital essences of the state and government, decency in governance, respect for authority and sensitivity to the people’s needs have been enthroned as the purposes of the government. In such cases, the rights of the people are paramount in any action of the government and the exercise of authority by politicians and civil servants servicing the country. The judicious and transparent allocation of resources towards promoting the welfare of the citizens is a primary responsibility of any self-respecting government.

This should ultimately entail that the business of government is always conducted transparently, objectively, efficiently and prudently without the enthronement of self-interest as the purpose of being in power. While it is reported that billions, if not trillions, of Naira have been spent on social protection and welfare measures over the lifespans of several administrations, the evidence of the transparency of such programmes and their impacts are not readily apparent.

In situations where the conduct of basic activities of government such as budgeting and expenditure, construction of infrastructure, the disbursement of monetary support to citizens and other vital undertakings are often opaque, unfiltered and generally unknown to the citizens, then the credibility of the system is put into question and the interests and enthusiasm of the public are vitiated. Whenever citizens insist that their governments and officials should conduct themselves in agreeable fashion and in consonance with best practices everywhere, they are simply asking for the barest minimum of behaviour expected of office holders everywhere.

It is, therefore not charity or a favour but a duty for elected and appointed officials of government to conduct themselves in accordance with the demands and expectations of the citizens of the country. To what extent have successive governments taken citizens into their confidence or respected their opinions in matters to do with the running of the country, is subject to debate in Nigeria. The general perception that our elected representatives and appointed government officials are there to cater for our needs and interests have failed the test of time and practice, going by the way country has been left adrift for so long.

The inability to check corruption and maladministration over several decades is an indictment of our system and the capacity of our governments to address such existential problems facing our country. Hardly a day passes by without one report or the other surfacing about incidents of corruption afflicting the government but hardly are Nigerians assured of the prompt reaction of the government to deal with such reports. Therefore, representing and supporting the overall interests and outlooks of Nigerians apparently are not among the important preoccupations of our governments or of our elected officials.

Democracy is not a performance of smokes and mirrors, whereby the electorate is deceived into believing that all is well in the country and the interests of the people are well taken care of. Democracy is much more than the superficial attachment of ideals and slogans or the regurgitating of empty promises. Democracy is a commitment solemnly entered into between the governed and those in government, and the discharge of high responsibilities of state and administration based on approved good sense and judgement of both the people and those in power.

Where such ideals are not obtainable or the trust that binds the people and their government is broken by abuses and willful negligence of duties by elected or appointed officials, then the people should be allowed to exercise their rights and prerogative to bring about an alteration in the way they are led. This is the only way we can overcome the apathy of indolent success and unmerited disappointment that seem to have become the lot of Nigerians and the mean inheritance of our country.",https://dailytrust.com/on-good-governance-and-accountability-recipes-for-rescuing-nigeria-ii,https://dailytrust.com
On good governance and accountability: Recipes for rescuing Nigeria (I),"“In each successive revolution, the patient herd becomes the property of its new masters”, Edward Gibbon

The methodology involved in rescuing Nigeria from its state of listless drift and self-inflicted disaster, is to bring Nigerians back to their senses and to respect the tenets of good and effective governance that are obtaining elsewhere, as well as observing the principles of accountability of both elected and appointed officials of government. It is a sad indictment and a self-evident defect, that with each successive election, we end up becoming the patient herd that is the property of those we voted to be in power and exercise authority over us. All Nigerians, regardless of our places of origin, our ethnic or religious backgrounds, our social and economic situations, or our political persuasions, have been reduced to the condition of anonymity and uniform despair by the arbitrary power being exercised over us.

SPONSOR AD

Although we are supposed to be practicing a democratic form of government, we have no practical means to effectively redress our situation of abject hopelessness and despair, but we are forced to resign ourselves to a dismal fate of unmitigated disaster and disappointments. We have become captives of an arbitrary rule of elected officials and a pervasive and unproductive bureaucracy that have sat on our progress and fortunes like an incubus for so long. There is no disputing the fact that what Nigeria continues to suffer from is the apparent shortfall in good governance at all the three levels of administration namely local, state and federal. This defect has fundamentally and manifestly affected the country’s development trajectories and even its democratic credentials adversely.

The consequences of this is lack of accountability to the electorate and the apparent disregard for the rule of law seemingly everywhere. These in turn, have bred a myriad of ills in our country ranging from insecurity, poverty, high cost of living, corruption, bloated cost of government, lack of democratic participation, apathy towards governance, immature political systems, to many other observable defects that have retarded the country’s progress. If we are to make any headway along the development trajectory and regain the opportunities that have been lost over several decades of misrule and bad administration, we as a people must rethink governance in our country and insist on the observance of the basic and unavoidable practices that make for good government everywhere.

Nigerians must realise that they are not alone in this world or an island unto themselves. There are 192 other nations beside us, therefore, we cannot allow it be seen that we have failed as a country or a people, or that we simply do not have the capacity and wisdom to rule ourselves competently like others are doing. Insisting upon having good government in our country therefore, at this point in time in our history, is the most rational and even the most patriotic thing that we can do. So what is good governance? There are various definitions or approaches to this concept, which have been globally accepted as the standards for the measurement of a civilised system of administration of a nation. The Brookings Institute and the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) conducted a project which studied 200 countries between 1996 and 2020 covering six dimensions of governance. These are:

Voice and Accountability (citizens participation in the selection of their leaders and government, freedom of expression, association, of the media, etc) Political Stability and absence of Violence/Terrorism (likelihood of the government becoming destabilised or violently overthrown and the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies) Government Effectiveness (service delivery abilities, quality control and supervision, oversight of projects, quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from interference and political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, the credibility of the government’s commitment to such policies) Regulatory Quality (the ability of the government to formulate and implement policies that create conducive environments for private sector enterprises to thrive and for individual initiatives to succeed, and the respect of citizens and the state for the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them) Rule of Law (conduct of agents of the state and government, ability to enforce laws and regulations such as in contracts and agreements, respect for property rights, effective policing and administration of justice, control of levels of crime and violence) Control of Corruption (the extent to which public power is exercised for private gains, abuse of the state power by elites in power and their associates in the private sector).

According to the WGI report, “governance consists of the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised”. The idea of the exercise of authority is, therefore, very crucial. This entails above everything else responsibility, transparency, control, inclusiveness, observance of rule of law, respect for laid down processes and procedures, self-control and discipline while in power, and transparency in decision-making. The report went on to note governance “includes the process by which governments are elected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement policies; and the respect of citizens and the state for the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them”. We should remember that good governance is not an attribute reserved only for national governments. Even enterprises and private organisations are expected to imbibe and incorporate certain principles of governance. According to the Scottish Government Social Enterprise Strategy Governance Guiding Principles, governance is about following certain principles and rules that consist of established and approved systems and processes, as well as ensuring the effective and competent direction, supervision and accountability of an organisation. The Governance Guiding Principles noted that “governance is fundamentally about people and the way they perform their respective roles and responsibilities in order to achieve the outcomes of the organisation.

The report identified seven principles that are essential for effective governance namely Leadership, Ethics and Integrity, Stewardship, Accountability and Transparency, Effectiveness, Roles and Responsibilities and Participation. Moreover, from my study of the OECD Governance Guidelines Indicators (GGI), the following can be summed up as the essential requirements of good governance: Strong anti-corruption laws and enforcement abilities, efficient, transparent and accountable budgeting and public expenditure procedures and processes, strong infrastructure governance procedures, digital governance methods, innovative governance leading to efficiency in service delivery and accountability, open governance or transparency policies, policy coherence and sustainable development, public employment and management systems, strong, effective and transparent public procurement systems, strong and all round regulatory policies and supervision, emplacement of risk mitigation strategies in policies and programmes, gender, youth and inter-generational policy mainstreaming, and quality of leadership in government.

In the wake of the above indicators, it is logical to advance the preposition about good governance to include all attributes and possibilities that could be aggregated to bring about noticeable and incremental development of a country, and the establishment of conditions that conduce towards the attainment of peace, harmony, sustainable development, progressive increase in the quality of life of citizens, as well as enhancement of the prestige of the country. If a government is incapable or unable to provide such scenarios or possibilities, then the idea of its reorientation or replacement must be a choice to be made available to citizens of a country. This is what essentially democracy and elections are all about.",https://dailytrust.com/on-good-governance-and-accountability-recipes-for-rescuing-nigeria-i,https://dailytrust.com
"4% FOB charge, needless burden on Nigerians","The recent reintroduction of a four per cent charge on the Free-on-Board value of imports coming into the country by the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) will further exacerbate the burden on Nigerians. It has sparked a national outcry from the business community, especially the manufacturing sector, for self-evident reasons. For a populace that is already weighed down by the high cost of items, this new measure will only add to their burdens.

This policy was first introduced six months ago, precisely in February 2025. However, the government was quick to suspend the implementation of the policy following a similar outcry that greeted its introduction. Suddenly, it was introduced in July, and its implementation commenced on August 4, 2025.

In place of this measure, MAN wants the government to revert to the previous system of one per cent of the Comprehensive Import Supervision Scheme and a seven per cent cost of collection fee. The group argues that this system balances revenue generation with industrial competitiveness.

SPONSOR AD

Further, the government should note that this potentially harmful policy is coming on the heels of reports about rising stocks of unsold goods, with many of them expiring while in distributors’ shops or producers’ warehouses. Traders and manufacturers blamed this development on consumer resistance in response to the high prices of goods.

In January 2025, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) disclosed that its members recorded unsold inventory worth a staggering amount of N1.4 trillion. These high prices, according to the producers, are occasioned by the high costs of production across all sectors of the economy. MAN identified high inflation, a depreciating Naira, rising interest rates, escalating electricity tariffs, record low sales, multiplicity of taxes and levies, and insecurity as factors contributing to the high production costs. Most of the factors above are still at play in the economy, despite the reported downward trend in inflation for some months. For instance, CBN’s Monetary Policy Rate remains at 27.5 per cent, which means that manufacturers still pay much higher rates to access funds for business.

This policy may indeed be counterproductive as it could force some manufacturers to fold up due to rising costs of production, and importers prefer other ports in the sub-region. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has just published the July 2025 Purchasing Manager’s Index, a measure of changes in the level of economic activities within a period. Although the July PMI showed that the three sectors covered – Agriculture, Industry, and Services- recorded expansion for the eighth consecutive month, the expansion in industry was just marginal, with a PMI of just 51.1 points. The significance of this performance becomes clearer when it is noted that an index above 50 points shows expansion, while any index at 50 points indicates no change.

The government should be guided by dynamics in the economy, especially intelligence provided by economic indicators.

A significant portion of the imports that come into Nigeria is raw materials or equipment used to produce goods. Nigeria imports such goods because the country does not produce them. Logically, subjecting intermediate goods to this additional charge in this high-cost environment can only force the importers, being manufacturers, to pass the resultant high costs to consumers by way of higher prices for the goods.

We call on the government to implement its policy of Nigeria First, which says that the government would give priority to locally made goods in the procurement of materials by its ministries, departments, and agencies.

The government should encourage our local industries to produce most of the goods we consume locally. This can be achieved by pursuing industrial policies that will offer quick wins for the country’s industrial sector by stimulating local production, including most of the raw materials currently being imported. Daily Trust believes that Nigeria, as a country, should be able to produce most of the raw materials locally.

This calls for a commitment to the Nigeria First policy, which aims to promote local production and reduce reliance on imports. The government says it is attracting foreign direct investment into the economy, which must be pursued strategically. It calls for the appropriate sequencing of policies. Without first strengthening the capacity of the local industrial base, introducing this type of charge on imports will surely lead to higher prices.

The government should also be aware of the fact that due to the rising cost of imports, the level of uncleared goods at the nation’s ports has shot up, with the demurrage on such goods rising as well. The increased cost of imports has led to a surge in uncleared goods at ports, with over 5,000 cargoes stuck, incurring over ₦2 trillion in demurrage costs. This does not synchronise with the picture of rising economic activities in the industrial sector as shown by the PMI for July.

Finally, a policy such as this should be based on comparative analysis. As MAN pointed out, West African countries like Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, and Senegal maintain lower import levies, ranging from 0.5 per cent to one per cent of the FOB value, with higher levies only on luxury or non-essential imports. With this, the new policy will make Nigerian ports less competitive.",https://dailytrust.com/4-fob-charge-needless-burden-on-nigerians,https://dailytrust.com
Concrete action required to save Africa,"The three-day African Chiefs of Defence Staff Summit ended in Abuja on August 27, 2025. Attended by military representatives from 36 out of the 54 African countries, the summit served as a critical platform for dialogue about shared security challenges and exploration of strategic insights on enhancing sub-regional and continental defence cooperation.

Furthermore, the summit was to advance regional stability and promotion of cost-effective, African-led solutions that enhances the continent’s military ability to address a collective security which tackles the challenges of Africa’s defence landscape, including rising insurgencies, extremist threats, and cross-border terrorism.

And this landscape is unenviable. For example, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, former Minister for External Affairs and Nigeria’s former Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UN) said over 1,000 insurgent groups are currently operating within the African continent with the majority of them deadly. And this explains why Africa, particularly the Sahel and neighbouring regions, is widely considered the epicentre for global terrorism and banditry, experiencing 43 per cent of global terrorism deaths in 2022. In fact, global terrorism deaths and attacks, especially in West Africa’s coastal states surged by 250 per cent in just two years. This is perpetrated by groups including Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram and its splinter Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), al-Qaeda affiliate Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimeen (JNIM) and the Islamic State affiliate Islamic State Sahel (ISIS-Sahel) and other groups operating in other parts of the continent.

SPONSOR AD

There are also organised crimes on the territorial waters that feed the violence on land. In the Gulf of Guinea, piracy and illicit trade are funding terrorism.

Perhaps, many expected the summit to marshal out concrete action plans that could change the narrative of an African landscape dominated by violent extremism and deadly transnational armed groups. But for now, the summit was great in conception and rhetoric as there is yet a specific actionable programme of implementation.

Daily Trust believes that Africa has had enough of these summits. There had been several U.S.-sponsored African Land Forces Summits. The U.S. African Command (AFRICOM) had also sponsored the African Chiefs of Defence Conference (ACHOD) in 2024 and 2025.

Even the African Union (AU) has been hosting theirs. The most notable, the third meeting of African Chiefs of Defence Staff (ACDS) held in Addis-Ababa, from May 15-16, 2003, kicked off the adoption of “The Policy Framework Document on the Establishment of the African Standby Force (ASF) and of the Military Staff Committee (MSC).” With the AU summit held in 2003 in Maputo, Mozambique ratifying it, the Peace and Security Council Protocol created the African Standby Force (Article 13) which was signed and adopted by member-states in 2004.

In 2013, the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crisis (ACIRC) was set up as a temporary rapid intervention force until ASF was ready. In the end, ACIRC too, was never deployed. In 2019, the AU integrated ACIRC into the ASF framework envisaged to operate with five regional brigade-sized standby forces, each in east, west, central, north and southern Africa. Each brigade was to have about 5,000 members for an overall strength of 25,000 personnel.

The only good the ASF initiative achieved was to use the force’s capabilities to deploy the ECOWAS mission to The Gambia, while the Southern African Development Community (SADC) deployed a similar mission to Lesotho. Under this, SADC also deployed missions to Mozambique in 2021 and the botched Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 2024. Likewise, the East African Community deployed a similar force in eastern DRC in 2022. Other similar arrangements include the Joint Force of the Group of Five for the Sahel, the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) against Boko Haram/ISWAP in the Lake Chad Basin, and the AU Regional Task Force against the Lord’s Resistance Army in Uganda.

But these were stop-gap interventionist forces. Therefore, Daily Trust calls on African leaders to stop being shy of taking action. Arising from the summit, the continent’s military leaders should move beyond the current ad hoc troop coalitions and mobilise their militaries especially as the unipolar world today does not favour Africa in terms of growth and stability, which explains the myriad of wars and crises within it.

Perhaps, it is pertinent to remind African political and military leaders again to take ownership the continent’s security architecture. The only way for Africa to escape the scourge of terrorism, civil and predatory wars, organised crime, and other forms of insecurity is operationalization of coordinated continental response. It is not in summits and issuance of communiques. The era of endlessly waiting for bilateral and multilateral partners to bail Africa out of its insecurity has become mere wishes.

Moreover, African leaders should strengthen their local Defence industries, using modern technologies to source the weapon systems for tackling the threats in order to guarantee human security. Each nation should secure itself before securing their sub-region and continent.

The militaries should mobilise and deploy new technologies like unmanned aerial systems and improvised explosive devices to counter threats against the people. Every African deserves to live in safety and dignity and this can only be achieved through a united approach.

Also, the idea of regional and continental standby force should move beyond declarations. The much talked about African Peace and Security Architecture must stop being a mere proposal but operationalised with specific modules and deployment concepts. This is supposed to be the essence of the summit.",https://dailytrust.com/concrete-action-required-to-save-africa,https://dailytrust.com
"FG to enroll 500,000 out-of-school children","The Federal Government has kicked off a new initiative aimed at reducing the number of out-of-school children and tackling literacy challenges across the country.

Through the National Commission for Mass Literacy, Adult and Non-Formal Education (NMEC), the government on Tuesday in Abuja began a two-day training for enumerators on the use of automated data collection tools.

Acting Executive Secretary of NMEC, Dr. John Onimisi, who is the coordinator Needs Assessment Team, explained that the programme is targeting the enrollment of over 500,000 learners in its first phase.

SPONSOR AD

He said the exercise would capture data on youths aged 15 and above who either dropped out of school or never had the opportunity to continue formal education.

According to him, the programme will not only focus on literacy but also vocational training, enabling learners to transition into skill acquisition programmes after completing the non-formal learning cycle.

“Our goal is to ensure that these learners are enrolled into non-formal education centres and supported to complete the programme successfully. Some will also move into vocational training afterwards,” Onimisi said.

He disclosed that the scheme would cut across the 774 local government areas in the country, with 376 enumerators drawn from the 36 states and the FCT already trained, while 250 facilitators would drive the exercise in Abuja.

To ensure transparency, Onimisi noted that data monitoring would be done in real-time through a dashboard linked to the National Identity Management System (NIMS), allowing for proper tracking and follow-up of learners.

“This is the first large-scale literacy data exercise by NMEC since the 2010 National Literacy Survey, and the delay has been due to funding limitations. The current intervention signals the government’s renewed commitment to bridging literacy gaps,” he said.

The first literacy cycle of the programme is expected to last between six to nine months depending on contact hours.

Onimisi commended the Minister of Education, Dr. Tunji Alausa, and the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) for supporting the intervention.

Also speaking, NMEC’s Director of Programmes, Mr. Samuel Aziba, said the training would equip enumerators with digital tools for data collection, adding that a pilot phase will begin in four FCT locations before the national rollout.

NMEC estimates that Nigeria had more than 30 million non-literate adults as of 2021, underscoring the urgency of the government’s intervention.",https://dailytrust.com/fg-to-enroll-500000-out-of-school-children,https://dailytrust.com
How water threatens girl-child education in Kano,"For decades, residents of Dutsen Bakoshi village in Shanono Local Government Area of Kano State have been battling a long-standing water crisis that has left them struggling to access clean water for daily household use, a situation that has continued to threaten the community’s economic development.

In a twisted fate, not only is the lack of potable water threatening the development of the community, it has ironically taken a negative toll on the education of the girl-child as many young girls have been forced to drop out of school due to their continuous daily search for water for their various families.

Findings by Weekend Trust showed that with a population of over 40,000 people spread across the 21 villages in the community, more than half of the residents, mostly farmers and their livestock, depend solely on seasonal dams that bear water only during the rainy season for their daily water needs.

SPONSOR AD

Findings also showed that residents, especially girls of school age, battle several hurdles to get water during the dry season as access to clean, potable water remains a daily challenge in the community.

Dutsen Bakoshi community is named after its legendary founder who reportedly discovered a large rock in the area, which is a major characteristic of the community that cannot be missed by any visitor in the area. However, ironically, this edifice, which is supposed to be a plus in terms of tourism for the community, is said to be one, if not the major factor responsible for the water shortage and sometimes lack of water in the area.

Despite its size and the number of surrounding villages, clean water remains a scarce necessity to come by in the community.

Weekend Trust’s visit to the community showed a community where girls of school age fetch water from available earth dams during school hours, a sight that has become a norm in the community.

Malam Musa Isyaku, a resident in the community, explained what waking up daily in the community means, especially for the girl-child. He noted that it means a continuation of daily struggle in search of water. He explained that due to lack of water in the community, many children, especially their daughters, could not fully attend school because everyday, they have to trek long distances in search of water for domestic use, especially during the dry season when the dams become dry.

“Every morning, our children have to leave in search of water; and you know that water is life. Every child has to ensure that his or her home has water for daily use before thinking of doing any other thing. This is our daily routine, especially during the dry season. Our children cannot afford to attend school fully because no matter what, they have to miss classes every day of the week. We are pleading with the government and anyone who can assist us to help bring an end to our suffering,” he said.

Another resident, Malama Maryam Tijjani, said earth dam had been their only source of water in the area, and after it dries off during the dry season, the hurdle of getting water begins until another rainy season. According to her, although the earth dam water is not clean, it has been the easiest way for them to get water for the community’s daily use.

“We are not oblivious of the fact that the available water is not clean for consumption but we do not have a choice. Our greatest trying moments every year is during the dry season because water during that period is equal to gold.

“Despite the fact that we have to use other means of water purification for the available water during the rainy season, as you can see, the water is still not clean. We use alum to treat it before we can use it,” Maryam said.

It was gathered that during dry season, members of the community cover many kilometers before they can get water, and those who cannot go to that extent rely on water vendors. A 25-litre container of water is sold at N500 for those that can afford it.

“A jerry can of 25 litres of water costs N500 during the dry season. This has put many families in this area under a lot of pressure. If you require 100 litres of water daily in your home, it means you need N2,000 daily for water, meaning that in a month, you will spend N60,000. This is what we have been going through, and that has made us to allow our children to fetch water for us despite the distance and the fact that they will miss school every day. We want our children in school but there’s hardly time. We are struggling to find both food and water,” Habiba Tijjani narrated.

‘Sad to see our daughters stop school for water’

Malama Asma’u Umar, a mother of four, said although as mothers they hate it when their children miss their classes or stop going to school, they had no option, especially during the dry season as the search for water is top priority for most families in the community, and as such, issues of schooling has no place.

“Our children, especially daughters, walk long hours to get us the water we will use. Not every family can afford to buy water from water vendors. The government should assist us to get water so that our children can go to school,” she pleaded.

One of the community leaders in the area, who is also a father, Malam Saidu Turaki, said it’s unfortunate that members of other communities blame them for their inability to send their children to school, not knowing that the issue is deeply rooted in the community’s lack of water.

He explained that as parents, their wish is to see that, like other children in cities, theirs would also prosper in life by getting good educated. He called on the authorities concerned to, as a matter of urgency, come to the aid of their community by providing water.

“People often blame parents for their children not going to school, but it is mostly due to the water crisis, especially given our large population. We want our children to go places and make us proud as parents too, but we are faced with an issue that requires urgent attention from the government. We have done our best at the community level, but as you can see that our best is not enough,” he said.

Malam Shuaibu Mustapha, a father of seven, noted that the community was well informed on the importance of education but said there’s equally a need for them to survive as a family. According to him, water scarcity in the community has become an issue they have to contend with, especially during dry season. He called on the state government to assist the local government in establishing an alternative source of water for the community.

‘Search for water hinders our education’

A 15-year-old Sadiqa Tijjani who lives with her parents in the community stopped going to school from JSS2 due to the responsibility to go in search of water for her family. She told Weekend Trust that she wanted to go to school and study but the search for water on a daily basis, especially during the dry season, posed a threat.

“Getting water is extremely difficult. It takes so much of our time. We can’t even go to school because during the dry season, there’s no water at all and we have to look for it to survive. Many girls like me are currently not in school because we have to look for water for our parents,” she said.

Sayyada Abdu, another 16-year-old girl who also stopped going to school at primary five, said she really missed studies, adding that the long search for potable water forced her to abandon her dream of getting good education.

She noted that many girls in her community had since abandoned school just to assist the family in search of water for their daily needs.

Reason for water shortage

The ward head of Dutsen Bakoshi, Ibrahim Ahmed, explained that the lack of potable water in the area had its root in the community’s geographical location. According to him, findings showed that the area lies beneath rocky plains that make it difficult for households to dig wells for water supply. He added that individuals in the community had tried to drill boreholes but the task was beyond their capacity.

He pleaded with well-meaning Nigerians and the state government to come to the aid of the community by providing potable water for the people.

Similarly, the councilor representing Dutsen Bakoshi, Abba Muhammad Idris, said that on many occasions, the local government had made several attempts to drill a borehole in the area but their efforts kept failing because of its topography.

“The government has made several attempts but our land is rocky. We have drilled as deep as 150 to 200 meters without finding water. This dam is our neFrom Abdulazeez Ibrahim, Kano

He called on the state government to assist the local government in establishing an alternative source of water for the community.

‘Search for water hinders our education’

A 15-year-old Sadiqa Tijjani who lives with her parents in the community stopped going to school from JSS2 due to the responsibility to go in search of water for her family. She told Weekend Trust that she wanted to go to school and study but the search for water on a daily basis, especially during the dry season, posed a threat.

“Getting water is extremely difficult. It takes so much of our time. We can’t even go to school because during the dry season, there’s no water at all and we have to look for it to survive. Many girls like me are currently not in school because we have to look for water for our parents,” she said.

Sayyada Abdu, another 16-year-old girl who also stopped going to school at primary five, said she really missed studies, adding that the long search for potable water forced her to abandon her dream of getting good education.

She noted that many girls in her community had since abandoned school just to assist the family in search of water for their daily needs.

Reason for water shortage

The ward head of Dutsen Bakoshi, Ibrahim Ahmed, explained that the lack of potable water in the area had its root in the community’s geographical location. According to him, findings showed that the area lies beneath rocky plains that make it difficult for households to dig wells for water supply. He added that individuals in the community had tried to drill boreholes but the task was beyond their capacity.

He pleaded with well-meaning Nigerians and the state government to come to the aid of the community by providing potable water for the people.

Similarly, the councilor representing Dutsen Bakoshi, Abba Muhammad Idris, said that on many occasions, the local government had made several attempts to drill a borehole in the area but their efforts kept failing because of its topography.

“The government has made several attempts but our land is rocky. We have drilled as deep as 150 to 200 meters without finding water. This dam is our nearest source. Once it dries up, we walk for hours to get water or buy from vendors. The case is before the council and I am sure that something will be done soon,” he said.

Govt’s effort

Also speaking on the issue, the council chairman, Abubakar Barau Shanon, said they were making efforts to ensure that the community has access to potable water. He said the council was trying to partner with the authorities in the state and other water-providing agencies to ensure that a lasting solution to the water problem is provided.

“At the local government level, we plan to conduct another site survey this week. While we haven’t found a suitable location within the town, we identified a viable spot some distance away. Unfortunately, this means that people will have to go a little far distance to access it, so the water challenge within the town remains. Last year, during the dry season, those who attempted to use water for irrigation farming could not do so because the people and livestock needed the water,” he said.arest source.

"NUC, academic leaders call for innovation in Nigerian universities","The Executive Secretary of the National Universities Commission (NUC), Prof. Abdullahi Yusuf Ribadu, has urged Nigerian universities to embrace innovation in order to be relevant in the 21st century, stressing that universities must evolve from being just degree-awarding institutions to being drivers of innovation, skills and national progress.

Prof. Ribadu made this call recently while delivering his goodwill message at the 4th Public Lecture of the African School of Economics (ASE), Abuja, delivered by Prof. Moses Ochonu of Vanderbilt University, United States.

The Executive Secretary, represented by the NUC Director of Skills Development and Entrepreneurship, Mr Ashafa Ladan, stated that Nigerian universities of the 21st century, “like the African School of Economics—the Pan-African University of Excellence—must be radically different” from their 20th century predecessors, adding that they must be “a hub of innovation, a crucible for problem-solving and a launchpad for global competitiveness.”

Prof. Ribadu said graduates of the Nigerian university system “must not only be adaptable, entrepreneurial, and ethically grounded while the research coming from universities must not only inform but also transform, contributing to national development, technological advancement and social wellbeing.”

In his goodwill message, the Secretary-General of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors of Nigerian Universities (CVCNU), Prof. Andrew Haruna, commended ASE Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Mahfouz Adedimeji and the institution for “their unwavering commitment to advancing knowledge.”

He noted that universities are at a crossroads of rapid global transformation and local imperatives, which require that they must critically re-examine their structures, values, and systems to serve better the aspirations of our nation and continent.

Prof. Haruna said Nigerian universities must confront the challenges of infrastructural deficits, funding limitations, brain drain, curriculum relevance and graduate employability.

He also stressed the importance of envisioning a future where universities become hubs of innovation, inclusive excellence and socio-economic transformation.

“Let me commend the African School of Economics for its initiative and bold vision. ASE has already shown a strong sense of purpose in boosting the capacity of African youth and aligning higher education with the needs of the Fourth Industrial Revolution,” he said.

In his lecture with the theme, “The 21st Century Nigerian University: Pitfalls and Pathways”, the Guest Speaker, Prof Ochonu, charged Nigerian universities to embrace change, integrate multidisciplinarity and shun academic inbreeding to remain relevant in the challenging 21st century.

According to him, universities all over the world are going through many challenges as the global economy convulse under the influence of overlapping technological and digital revolutions in knowledge, research and learning. Nigerian universities, he emphasised, are not excluded from these pressures.

Prof. Ochonu decried the subversion of foundational cosmopolitan ethos of higher education in some public universities which makes them to become “appendages of parochial projects of exclusivity” arguing that intellectual pluralism is being replaced by academic inbreeding.

While acknowledging that the age-long struggle of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) had secured some basic dignities for the academic workplace, he noted that the struggle had also become part of the problem, adding that “many lecturers continue to skip classes; poor or non-existent supervision and mentorship of postgraduate students persisted; and many lecturers continued to teach from outdated lecture notes, making no effort to update their instruction” while others patronise pay-to-publish predatory journals.

He recommended a Student Bill of Rights to protect students in their academic, supervisory, and mentorship relationship with lecturers.

Prof Ochonu equally canvassed revamping the craft of teaching, stressing that universities should establish centres of teaching and institute awards for teaching excellence in order to boost quality instruction.

The award-winning scholar also advocated for a system that allows professionals and workers in society to acquire new skills, upskill in emerging areas and satisfy their curiosities through single course enrolments while stressing the need for curriculum reform.

Earlier in his address, “Ideas Change the World”, Prof. Adedimeji traced the establishment of the first university in the world to 859 through the University of Qarawiyyin in Fez, Morocco, which made Africa the cradle of higher education.

He noted that university education had grown in Nigeria to over 300 universities while debates continued to centre on the issues of quality, quantity, access and relevance.

He encouraged Nigerian universities to consider their challenges as opportunities while clamouring for collaboration.

“My call is for more synergy, more collaboration and more partnership among our universities for all-round development and a radical departure from working in silos,” he said, reiterating the imperative of leveraging technology and partnerships to address issues.

Citing a study by the University of Lincoln, Prof. Adedimeji identified the 10 grand challenges of the 21st century as changing economic powers, living in a global society, void of vision and foresight, technological disruption, migration and mobility (which manifest in what we call the Japa syndrome in Nigeria), conflict and war, civic disaffection, increasing inequality of wealth and income, mitigating environmental and ecological damage as well as identities and changing norms in the society.

He explained that addressing these challenges required functional university education and urged universities to come together to overcome those challenges as well as the national ones.

“I, therefore, call for concerted efforts of the Triple-Helix, the government, the academia and the industry/society in according the university its pride of place by doing what is right at the right time. It is said that one can travel fast alone but can only travel far together,” he said.",https://dailytrust.com/nuc-academic-leaders-call-for-innovation-in-nigerian-universities,https://dailytrust.com
WASSCE: Knocks for WAEC over late night exam,"Parents, teachers and other stakeholders have criticised the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) over its handling of the delay in conducting English Language Paper 2 in the ongoing 2025 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) on Wednesday evening.

This is coming after some disturbing videos and pictures emerged where candidates were shown writing the examination late at night, with some centres without good electricity and candidates had to make do with touch lights and mobile phone flashlights.

English language is one of the core subjects a student must obtain credit in to secure admission into higher institutions and thus, the examination is a must for every student who wishes to further his or her education.

SPONSOR AD

Those who spoke with the Daily Trust blamed the development on the reprinting of question papers after a reported leak a few days before the exam day.

WAEC confirmed this in a statement on Thursday, apologising for delay in conducting English Language Paper 2, stating that it faced considerable challenges primarily due to its major aim of preventing leakage of any paper.

However, many parents and other Nigerians took to social media platforms to report the incidents in some states across the country and criticised the exam body for putting the life of candidates at risk.

A parent, Dorathy Makir, while speaking on the delay, said it was unacceptable for WAEC to put the lives of candidates at risk.

She said the least the council could have done was to reschedule the examination, rather than subjecting the candidates to unnecessary suffering.

“My child wrote the English language examination up till 8pm on Wednesday. It rained heavily at about that time and we all know how the state currently struggles with insecurity. This is not right,” Makir said.

Another parent, who does not want to be named, said she had to leave what she was doing at home to go to the school to wait for her daughter.

“If not that English language is an important subject, I would have taken my child home because that was a risky thing to do. Children were all tired and who knows if they still remembered what they had studied. WAEC needs to do better to avoid such occurrences again,” she said.

Reps panel issues WAEC 24-hour ultimatum to appear before it

The House of Representatives Committee on Basic Education and Examination Bodies has given WAEC a 24-hour ultimatum to appear before it today to address concerns over its ongoing WASSCE.

Chairman of the Committee, Hon. Oboku Abonsizibe Oforji, issued the ultimatum on Thursday following WAEC’s failure to honour an earlier invitation to appear before the panel.

According to Oforji, the committee had invited WAEC to provide explanations over widespread complaints and irregularities observed during the ongoing examinations.

In a statement, Oforji recalled that the committee extended an invitation to WAEC on Tuesday, May 27, 2025, seeking clarification on various issues disrupting the conduct of the exams across the country.

He expressed disappointment at WAEC’s absence during the scheduled hearing on Thursday, May 29, describing it as unacceptable given the scale of public outcry over the conduct of the ongoing exams.

“The examinations have been riddled with serious irregularities. We’ve received reports of students writing exams as late as midnight in some centres across the country.

“The House felt it necessary to summon WAEC to explain these developments and the trauma candidates are currently facing. However, WAEC responded this morning, saying they couldn’t appear due to their involvement in the ongoing exams. Ironically, this is the very reason we are asking them to appear,” he said.

Oforji emphasised that the committee expects WAEC to appear before it on Friday, warning that failure to do so would compel the lawmakers to invoke the constitutional powers of the House to ensure compliance.

“Our intention is not to witch-hunt WAEC but to seek answers that will calm public tension and prevent a recurrence of these challenges. WAEC has been conducting exams for decades, and we have never experienced this level of disorganization,” he said.

‘WAEC has done injustice to students with special challenges’

A teacher at the Community Secondary School, Apir in Benue State who preferred anonymity, said the essay question papers arrived late and that was why the examination was taken at night.

“We were told the materials were brought from Enugu. The students began writing around 5pm and ended at 7pm. But the school provided a generator to supply electricity in the classrooms,” the teacher said.

In Ogun, a school principal who pleaded anonymity said questions were reprinted in Abeokuta and sent across different parts of the state.

The question papers didn’t arrive at some schools in rural areas until 8pm, it was gathered.

A teacher at Igiri High School, Ijofin, in Ipokia Local Government Area of Ogun State, said the development affected English paper.

“They have written the Paper I which was Objective, but before they (officials) brought Paper II, it was around 8pm,” the teacher said.

According to him, the crisis also affected Community High School, Tube and other schools across Ipokia Local Government.

The teacher explained that the students wrote the exams using torchlights.

“Of course, the condition in which they wrote the exams would definitely affect their performances.

“Again, you know the examination body is trying to fight malpractice. Under such conditions, for me, the exam has lost its credibility.

“Secondly, we have students with special challenges like eye problems who could not read or write well at night. WAEC has done injustice to them.

“We have solar light donated to the school by the government with six bulbs. That’s what we used.

“Some parents came to the school to look for their children and later went back home to bring torchlights upon learning that they were going to write the exams towards the night. They gave their children torchlights and returned home, while others waited,” he said.

Another teacher in Ifo, Ifo Local Government Area of Ogun State, said students concluded their exams around 10pm.

Some candidates who spoke to Daily Trust expressed distress after having to wait for hours to commence the examination.

One of the candidates, who identified herself as Mariam described the experience as distressing.

“I sat for the examination at Community Secondary School, Apir, on the outskirts of Makurdi metropolis. We completed the first section of the paper around 1pm, then waited without any explanation until 5pm to start the essay part. We didn’t finish until after 7pm,” she said.

Like many other students, Mariam expressed fear that the extended delay and fatigue may affect their performance in the crucial subject.

She said, “Because of the anxiety of waiting too long for the examination to begin, I’m not quite certain of getting a good credit. At one point, the school provided light in the examination hall for our use.”

Similarly, Terna Kusu, another candidate who sat for the examination said he was able to complete writing his paper at 7:15pm while the rains came down heavily and everywhere was dark.

Kusu said, “I can only hope to pass the examination because the stress was much.”

“I was only stressed, but I answered all the questions, so I am not sure if it will affect my results,” he said.

In Lagos, a candidate who wants to be identified only as Tunde said he finished his exams at 8:30pm, adding that he felt tired between the hours he ended the English language paper 1 and the time to start the paper 2.

“We ended the objectives section in the afternoon, then waited till past 6pm before we started the theory,” he said.

Another candidate, Taiwo Omisakin, expressed surprise, saying she started with objective questions before writing theory, describing it as a detour from previous exams.

She said she was confident in her answers, adding it won’t affect her results despite the exams ending late in the night.

“It was a bit stressful, but I answered all the questions, so I am not sure it will affect my results,” she said.

In Abeokuta, some students were lucky to have concluded the exam between 6pm and 7pm.

In Kisi, Oyo State, a similar scenario played out but students in schools in the community were done with their papers around 7pm.

Victor, a student of Baptist Heritage High School, Kisi, said, “We finished the exam past 6pm. We learnt it was due to a change of questions.

“If not for the delay, we ought to have concluded the exam by 4pm.”

A candidate in one of the public schools in Osogbo said: “Our school does not have electricity supply but our teachers hired a generator, yet the lighting in the hall was poor.”

Another student, who noted that the school made use of generator to ensure uninterrupted supply during the examination, said: “That was my first time writing an exam in the night. It was not conducive enough. We were even exhausted at that time. It wasn’t ideal.”

Educationists advise against reoccurrence

An educationist, Michael Sule, said what happened was unfortunate and tested our ability to take favourable decisions on examination.

“If WAEC found out that the paper leaked and they tried to change it. The best decision would have been, the moment they realized they were running against time, they should have shifted it to another day instead of putting candidates in distress,” he said.

Sule said he understands that the government is working to stop malpractice, but still going ahead with the examination at night is unacceptable considering the state of most of our schools that lack the necessary infrastructure for such an emergency, adding that such should not repeat itself again.

Another educationist, Architect Goke Omigbodun, said the exam body should guard against reoccurrence of night examination because many schools may not have electricity supply.

Abdulraheem Adekoya, HOD Humanities Department at Sanya Senior Grammar School, Lagos, described the situation as a decline of moral decadence in education, blaming it on parents, teachers and guardians who want better results for their wards at all cost.

Adekoya, whose daughter finished her exam late in the night, berated the examination body for the delay in changing the questions that leaked, calling for reforms in the country’s education sector.

“This is a national disaster. I think the way forward is when we all resolve to bring a lasting solution to it. If not, it will continue like that.

“So, I am advocating what we call educational reform, not just on paper, that would be pragmatic, that would be practical. And from the reform, it should be strongly stipulated that anyone that is caught, anyone, schools, authorities, institutions caught engaging in such should be seriously and severely dealt with,” he said.

Oladejo Abiola, a director of education in Lagos Ministry of Education whose daughter wrote her exams in Ota, Ogun, commended the effort of the examination body to halt examination malpractice.

Students trapped as classrooms collapse during exam in Taraba

Meanwhile, on the same day, hundreds of students escaped by the whiskers when the classrooms in which they were sitting for the Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination caved in.

The incident happened at Government Secondary School, Namne, Gassol Local Government Area of Taraba State.

The classrooms collapsed during a heavy rainfall which was accompanied by a windstorm.

The students and their invigilators were trapped in the collapsed classrooms for hours before some residents rescued them.

A resident, Alhaji DanAzumi Lauris, told Daily Trust that it was the second set of students that the classrooms collapsed on, as the first set had finished their exams and left the school premises.

He said the incident occurred around 6pm on Wednesday.

DanAzumi stated that the injured students and teachers were moved to Primary Healthcare Centre located a few meters away from the school to receive treatment.

He said apart from the school, the storm destroyed many houses in the community.

In Jalingo town, many students went back home after 1am as a result of heavy rainfall which started when they were writing their exams. The rainfall lasted hours, preventing many of them from going back home till after 1am.

Atiku wants re-sit for affected candidates

Also, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar took to his Facebook page to lend his voice to the issue.

He wrote: “The recent report of students sitting for the West African Senior School Certificate Examination in appallingly dark and unfit conditions across the country is nothing short of a national disgrace. That this outrage occurred just a day after the world marked International Children’s Day only deepens the shame.

“This is not merely an unfortunate incident — it is a damning indictment of our systemic failure to uphold the most basic standards in public education. It is unacceptable, unjustifiable, and utterly indefensible that in 2025, our children are forced to write critical national exams in pitch darkness like second-class citizens.

“This incident must awaken our national conscience. It must compel immediate and sustained investment in critical social infrastructure, with education as the foremost priority — not in rhetoric but in tangible action.

“I therefore demand, unequivocally, that the affected examination paper be retaken in all compromised centres. Anything less would be a grave injustice to the students whose futures hang in the balance.

“Examination preparedness is a shared responsibility between students and the examination authorities. In this case, it is glaringly evident that the latter have failed spectacularly in their duty. It would be utterly unjust to allow students to suffer the consequences of such gross institutional negligence.

“Going forward, it is imperative that relevant authorities establish and enforce minimum environmental and infrastructural standards for all high-stakes national examinations. We must never allow such a shameful scenario to repeat itself — not under our watch,” he concluded.

WAEC apologises for delay

In a statement signed by Moyosola Adesina, Head, Public Affairs, West African Examinations Council, the examination body apologised for the inconveniences that stemmed from the delay in the examination.

“WAEC acknowledges the challenges currently being faced during the conduct of WASSCE for school candidates 2025, including the delay in the timely conduct of English Language Paper 2.

“While maintaining the integrity and security of our examination, we faced considerable challenges primarily due to our major aim of preventing leakage of any paper. While we successfully achieved our objective, it inadvertently impacted the timeliness and seamless conduct of the examination,” the statement read.

The examination body also said plans are underway to collaborate with security agencies in an attempt to prevent similar incidents.

“Despite our best efforts, we encountered logistical hurdles, security concerns, and sociocultural factors that negatively influenced our operations. In order to forestall future occurrences of this nature, the council is currently collaborating with security agencies.

“We recognise the importance of timely conduct of examinations and the impact of this decision on the candidates, their schools and parents, and we sincerely apologise for any inconveniences caused.

“The West African Examinations Council appreciates the understanding and support of all stakeholders during this period. We remain committed to upholding the highest standard in the conduct of examinations and shall continue to promote academic excellence,” the statement reads.",https://dailytrust.com/wassce-knocks-for-waec-over-late-night-exam,https://dailytrust.com
Leadership crisis rocks Katsina varsity again,"The Federal University, Dutsin-Ma (FUDMA), Katsina State, is again embroiled in a leadership crisis following controversies surrounding the selection process for the vice-chancellor position.

The crisis erupted after the university’s governing council shortlisted candidates for interview for the VC role. Some aspirants criticised the process, accusing the outgoing vice-chancellor, Prof. Armayau Bichi, of manipulating the exercise to favour his preferred candidate.

These allegations have drawn widespread attention, particularly within academic circles, prompting two aggrieved contenders to file formal petitions challenging the process.

SPONSOR AD

However, Prof Bichi denied the allegations, saying the selection process was conducted with utmost integrity.

Petitions against outgoing VC

One of the contenders, Prof. Sadiq Radda, submitted a petition to the Minister of Education, Tunji Alausa, alleging a deliberate plan to compromise the process and exclude him from consideration.

Prof. Radda, a professor in the Sociology Department at Bayero University, Kano, claimed that several qualified candidates were dropped without justification despite fulfilling all the advertised requirements.

He accused the outgoing vice-chancellor of attempting to impose a less qualified candidate.

In his petition dated April 25, which was also copied to the Minister of State for Education, Suwaiba Ahmad, the Chairman of the Governing Council, and the ASUU chapter at FUDMA, he wrote: “I am one of the applicants for the post of Vice-Chancellor, Federal University, Dutsin-Ma. I complied with all the criteria outlined in the university’s advertisement. The Council met and conducted a selection process. Shockingly, many of us were eliminated without any valid explanation.

Another contender for the position of vice chancellor, Professor Usman Aliyu Dustinma, has filed a petition to the institution’s Governing Council, alleging bias, irregularities, and a lack of transparency in the ongoing selection process.

In a letter dated April 28, 2025, and copied to the Minister of Education, Tunji Alausa, Prof. Dustinma criticised the process, claiming that merit and due process were being compromised in favour of certain preferred candidates.

He alleged that the exercise was skewed to benefit a specific applicant, in contravention of the advertised criteria and standard procedures guiding the appointment of vice chancellors in Nigerian federal universities.

Both aggrieved candidates expressed satisfaction with the federal government’s prompt intervention in the matter, calling on the Minister of Education to review the entire process in the interest of fairness and institutional integrity.

In a separate open letter to the minister, a legal practitioner, Sulaiman Muhammad Namadi, from Dutsin-Ma, raised additional concerns about the selection process.

Namadi alleged that the outgoing vice chancellor was attempting to impose a preferred successor, potentially at the expense of more qualified candidates.

He called for an immediate investigation and ministerial intervention to ensure a fair and transparent recruitment process.

Lingering leadership tussle

FUDMA in Katsina State is one of the twelve federal universities established by the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan in 2010. It was notably the first among them to matriculate students and commence academic activities in July 2012.

However, since its inception, the university has been embroiled in persistent leadership crises. The first vice chancellor, Professor James Ayatse, was the subject of several petitions, which reportedly prompted the federal government to constitute a visitation panel. The panel’s findings culminated in the termination of his appointment alongside others.

Professor Haruna Kaita was appointed as Ayatse’s successor but soon found himself at odds with the university’s governing council, led by Dr. Marliya Zayyana. Despite Kaita’s efforts to address key challenges at the institution, mutual accusations of undermining authority marred his tenure. The situation escalated when Dr Zayyana convened a meeting that led to Kaita’s suspension based on allegations of financial mismanagement.

According to a dismissal letter dated April 13, 2017, Kaita was accused of unilaterally dismissing 160 staff members and reappointing others without council approval, along with other allegations of financial misconduct. Kaita denied the accusations and challenged his suspension at the National Industrial Court.

Following his removal, Professor Armayau Bichi was appointed in an acting capacity, although such appointments are legally limited to six months. Bichi remained in office for about two years before stepping aside under pressure. He was succeeded by Prof. Baba Kutigi, who also served for six months, after which Dr Babangida Dangani took over as acting vice chancellor.

During this period, an advert was published to fill the substantive VC position, but the process was halted by a court due to pending litigation. In total, FUDMA has had five vice chancellors, including four in an acting capacity, leading to institutional instability.

At various times, these developments prompted intervention from the National Assembly’s Senate and House Committees on Tertiary Education.

Despite attempts by the National Universities Commission (NUC) and the Federal Ministry of Education to mediate, the leadership crisis has persisted.

30 professors failed screening test – Prof Bichi

Efforts to reach the Vice Chancellor, Professor Armaya’u Hamisu Bichi, were unsuccessful, as he neither answered calls from our reporter nor responded to a text message sent to him.

However, in a recent interview with another newspaper, Professor Bichi revealed that 30 out of the 36 professors who applied for the position of Vice Chancellor failed to meet the required selection criteria.

He explained that the selection committee conducted the screening process with utmost integrity and fear of the Almighty Allah. Only six candidates, he said, successfully passed the screening.

The outgoing Vice Chancellor also noted that three of the applicants were from Katsina State. However, he stressed that their origin did not influence the outcome, as they were unable to meet the 10 essential criteria set by the committee.

Professor Bichi further alleged that some of the applicants submitted petitions against the committee even before the screening report was released, apparently in anticipation of not passing the process.

FUDMA appoints new acting VC

The Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academics), Professor Aminu Ado, has been appointed as the new acting vice chancellor of the university.

According to a special bulletin signed by the Director of Information and Protocol, Nasir Abdul, Professor Ado was elected during the 130th Special Senate Meeting held on Monday, May 5, 2025.

“Although he was the sole nominee for the position, his nomination was subjected to a vote, in which he received 92 votes in favour and 2 against,” the bulletin said.

Professor Ado will assume office following the expiration of the tenure of the current Vice Chancellor, Professor Armaya’u Hamisu Bichi, on Monday, May 12, 2025.

The bulletin further noted, “In his opening remarks, the Vice Chancellor, Professor Bichi, explained that the Special Senate Meeting was convened to elect an Acting Vice Chancellor who would serve pending the conclusion of the selection process for a new substantive Vice Chancellor.”

Professor Ado brings a wealth of experience to the role, having previously held several key positions in the university. These include Head of the Department of Microbiology, Dean of the Faculty of Life Sciences, Acting Provost of the College of Health Sciences, and both External and Internal Examiner.

Similar VC crisis

The University of Abuja recently witnessed a leadership crisis over the appointment of Professor Aisha Sani Maikudi as Vice-Chancellor.

Forty-three professors petitioned President Bola Tinubu, claiming her appointment violated the 10-year professorial experience requirement, as she had only served two years.

The Governing Council defended the process, citing legal compliance.

However, on February 6, Tinubu removed Maikudi and dissolved the Council, appointing Professor Patricia Manko Lar as acting Vice-Chancellor for six months.

Days later, ten other professors petitioned the president, calling Maikudi’s removal unconstitutional and demanding a reversal of the decision, thereby deepening the controversy.",https://dailytrust.com/leadership-crisis-rocks-katsina-varsity-again,https://dailytrust.com
"Maize, rice prices soar as floods submerge Taraba farms","The prices of rice and maize have surged in Taraba State following floods that destroyed crops worth millions of naira in farming communities along the River Benue. The disaster, which affected five local government areas, submerged over 2,500 rice and maize farms.

Before the flooding, the prices of paddy rice and maize had been on the decline. However, they spiked sharply after the calamity. A 100kg bag of maize, which sold for between N25,000 and N27,000 days before the floods, now costs up to N40,000. Similarly, the price of a 100kg bag of paddy rice rose from N34,000 to N40,000, Daily Trust gathered.

This year’s flooding which has been described as the worst in recent years also damaged residential buildings in several communities. The worst-hit areas include Kunini in Lau LGA, Mayoreniyo in Ardo-Kola LGA, parts of Mutum Biyu in Gassol LGA, and several communities in Karim-Lamido LGA.

Umar Muhammad Lawal, a farmer in Mayoreniyo, said more than 800 rice and maize farms were destroyed in villages such as Jiro Kufayi, Jiro Kiriga, Jiro Sabongari, Jiro Dauda, Jiro Nabari, Kiriga Boya, Bendo Tugge, and Fataki. Others include Gurbi Zangai, Salo Bani, and Mayoreniyo, all in Ardo-Kola LGA.

He explained that most of the farms were located close to the River Benue. “I lost four farms to the flood, while other farmers lost rice and maize worth millions of naira,” he said.

According to him, the flood came earlier than expected. “Each year, flooding usually occurs around late September, after most farmers have harvested their crops. But this year, it came too soon. Days before the disaster, a bag of maize was N20,000. A few days after the flood destroyed nearly 80 percent of rice and maize farms, the price jumped to N40,000,” he lamented.

He warned that the disaster would lead to a shortage of grains, especially in riverine communities where harvests have been wiped out.

In Karim-Lamido LGA, Sale Binnari told Daily Trust that hundreds of farms were submerged. The worst-hit areas include Binnari, Gorowa, Didango, Shimiyel, Nahuta, Belengo, and Mariyo.

Similarly, in Gassol LGA, farming communities affected include Baranda, Maigoro Kwatan Nanido, Mutum Biyu, Sheka, Hassan Kwatan Ibrahim Kiriga Jen, Zip, Kambari, Amar, and Sansani.",https://dailytrust.com/maize-rice-prices-soar-as-floods-submerge-taraba-farms,https://dailytrust.com
Export ban: FG to commence mapping of shea tree areas in 2 weeks,"The Raw Materials Research and Development Council has said it will commence the mapping of shea tree areas in the next two weeks, following the federal government’s six-month export ban.

Director General/Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Raw Materials Research and Development Council (RMRDC), Prof Nnanyelugo Martin Ike-Muonso, while interacting with journalists in Abuja recently, said the president has taken the right decision, which the council has always advocated.

“When I took over as the DG of the RMRDC, one of the things I started campaigning for was that you do not export raw materials without adding 30 per cent value to them. And we took it to the National Assembly, it went through first, second and third readings at the Senate. So, the president took the right step on this goal that we are pursuing because it is in the overall interest of the country.

“Instead of talking of volumes of exported raw materials, we should be talking about the value of exported semi-processed raw materials or even fully processed raw materials, because in that, employment is created. Even our currency gets strengthened,” he said.

He said the studies the council has done internally show that the country produces more than a million metric tons, adding that, “you can easily get a million metric tons of shea nuts from 21 states.”

“And over 90 per cent of this output is exported. So basically, what we do is think in terms of the volumes of export of shea nuts. And this is a highly demanded raw material. But we just basically throw it away. Counting volumes of what we’ve exported without also thinking in terms of the value that we would have gained in terms of foreign currency and the employment it would generate locally,” he noted.

Next steps

The DG said the first step is to bring together stakeholders to review the existing roadmap, to ensure sustainability by ensuring that there are enough and adequate supplies of shea nuts for utilisation by other processors that will be coming up.

“The second thing that we are going to do is to map, to conduct a special mapping of shea trees in the country, based on the quantity available and also the qualities. You know, the shea tree that is in Niger is significantly different in terms of its quality and characteristics from the shea nuts that you see in Sokoto. And each of those varieties also has what they are more relevant for, the kind of products and, you know, the value chain they support, the better. So, with that mapping, which we are going to commence almost immediately, is going to support those who are going to invest by following the trail of the federal government’s decision at this time.

“So that they have the information required to make investments in the shea processing business. We are going to commence that effort in the next two weeks. At present, we have started discussing with researchers and enumerators, and those are going to help us collect this data across the 21 states that are actively growing shea trees.

“In the next two weeks, we are going to be rallying all stakeholders for a review of the five-year roadmap, which has now elapsed. That roadmap was developed in 2019. It’s now elapsed.

So we are going to be reviewing that roadmap to ensure that there is adequacy of shea nuts because as more interest in the shea industry is encouraged by this decision of the federal government, the supply chain is also effectively sustained,” he said.

Prof Ike-Muonso said the third thing the council will do is to launch a national women cluster cooperative to engage and train women.

“The biggest problem is in collection because it’s grows in the wild and women need to be trained on safety, but also how to pick the best quality shea nuts, and also in some processing, because even for smallholder processors, the quality needs to improve. So, this capacity building would be launched across the country simultaneously in the next two weeks.

“We are also going to seek the support of state governments and other agencies, collaborate with them, to see how we are going to roll out processing equipment at the cluster level too. To enable smallholder operators to also engage, participate in this new industry. That way, we can all work together to activate and make sure that the intentions of the president and the federal government are realised.

“SOther things we intend to do are the cultivation. We are going to be talking and working with other state governments to quickly launch and see how we can get them to participate by also donating significant acreages for planting of shea trees,” he said.

He said the council has also developed a mechanism for reporting back to the presidency, on regular updates on capacity utilization, the jobs created, foreign exchange saved, on account of the FG export ban decision, adding that “we feel and we believe that this is a critical role to play, to encourage the presidency to take additional decisions, that support the processing of raw materials before export.”",https://dailytrust.com/export-ban-fg-to-commence-mapping-of-shea-tree-areas-in-2-weeks,https://dailytrust.com
‘How AI can boost livestock farmers’ income’,"Mr. Emmanuel Nnoko is the Managing Director of Livestock Genetics Africa. He has spent nearly three decades in Europe, particularly in Sweden, where he gained invaluable experience and expertise in the field of livestock genetics. This extensive exposure to European agricultural practices and technologies has equipped him, enabling him to apply innovative solutions to Nigeria’s livestock needs. In this interview with Daily Trust, he explains how Artificial insemination (AI) can benefit Nigerian livestock farmers. Excerpts:

You have been focusing on helping farmers improve their cattle breeds for better productivity. What informed your decision?

SPONSOR AD

I’ve spent a lot of time in Europe, notably Sweden, but after witnessing the benefits of agriculture, particularly with regards to cattle, I decided to come back home. In light of this, we founded Livestock Genetic Africa. We represent a breeding company in Denmark that uses Viking genetics. Viking is a well-known breeding company worldwide.

I saw that the country’s livestock has potential, but although there are over 20 million cows, the productivity of our cows is extremely low. While we do have a large number of cows, the output of that product is extremely low because, in a typical local setting, the cows produce one to two litres of milk per day, whereas in a normal setting in the West, the cows produce at least 20 to 40 litres. This is a significant difference, which is why I came back to Nigeria to improve our local breed so that we can produce 20 to 35 litres of milk per day.

Have farmers adopted and utilised the technology you brought into the livestock sector since you came up with Genetic Africa in 2022?

Yes. The first farm we used as a trial farm was that of the current Minister of Livestock, Idi Muktar Maiha. He is the first farmer to use our semen, which we offer along with other embryo transfers, and we had a 70-75 percent success rate on his farm.

We have continued to operate on various farms since then. Another large farmer in Kaduna is Arla Farm, which we service. We have about 80 percent success on their farm. There are several farms where we are currently operating as a result of our work on other farms. We’re in Jigawa. Some farmers who used the technology from us have given us positive feedback on our semen’s mobility and ability. The most significant reason for saying this is that the only thing that can propel Nigeria forward is the genetic development of livestock. Without genetic enhancement, we cannot scale up to produce the grade of animal that will provide you with that type of milk or meat. That is why we currently service both cattle and dairy farms. We also collaborate with states. We provide services to farmers in Niger State. We are working on certain initiatives in Taraba State, specifically the Sadauna Animals Transformation Programme, and we have organised some farmers who have agreed to participate in the project to enhance their animals.

Which breeds do you supply to farmers?

In the dairy industry, for example, there are three different breeds to consider. We have the Jersey, the Holstein, and the Ayrshire. The Holstein is the most versatile breed because it produces the most milk; you can make up to 20 to 40 litres of milk. When it comes to Viking Jersey or Viking Red, they give up to 30 litres. What is most important is the fat content because they are very good for cheese and other things, so the fat content is very high.

When it comes to beef, today we have six types of beef breeds. We have Simmental, Charolai, Angus, Hereford, Belgian Blue and Limousin. When it comes to the kind of breed we have in Nigeria today, the meat is so hard, and it takes a longer time for the animal to mature, to get that body carcass, which is up to maybe 300 to 400kg. But when it comes to our Viking breed, in six months, you can already scale the body carcass to up to 800 to 700 Kilogrammes. The meat is softer, and there’s a lot of benefit when you can upgrade. In a local setting, these local cows take maybe three to four years to mature, while in a local Viking breed, it takes from six months to one year to mature for the purpose you want to use it for.

Dairy needs lots of finances. Do you have a program that takes care of small-scale farmers or community people who want to set up a dairy or beef farm?

Part of our concern as an organisation is looking at the social corporate responsibility and then supporting individual farmers, especially the smallholder farmers, so that they too can benefit from this. Normally, by the settings, due to awareness and financial capacity, most of the people that go for this at this level are basically the elites. Now, the question about having concern and special consideration for community-based approach and people that are the smallholder farmers is really part of what the Livestock Genetics Africa is having as a roadmap that is supporting this. So our approach is highly accommodating for them, especially when they are coming in as a group in the form of a community, or whether they are being supported by a government or by any organization so that they can have this catch. We realize that the only way for us to have massive value generation in the sector is when the communities and individual smallholder farmers are involved, because operating with the elites only limits the value to that top cycle. So definitely, we have special consideration that comes based on the available situation, and we can collaborate with relevant stakeholders to empower these people through this new breeding system so that they can, in their own way, have a very sustainable economic system while supporting the general value chain for both the beef and the milk.

We have different agroecological zones here and we are told some of the breeds might have challenges surviving here. Do you consider that when you do insemination across the country?

Yes. We consider things like the kind of semen we bring in. We have to have a high rate of calf survival, easy calving, good health, and the adaptability of this environment. So, that is why we select the best because when you inseminate the local breed and the foreign breed, it has the gene of 50-50. So, the gene of that 50-50 has made the F1 generation of that calf become adaptable to the environment. The disease resistance is very good. All these things are being put into consideration.

How affordable would this be for some farmers or even young people who want to start a dairy farm?

We are not too rigid about pricing. Like we said, we are doing a business that is service-based, and we consider the development of the sector more important than profit. And because of that, it is very, very affordable, especially when you are coming as a group.

When you are coming as a group, not as an individual farmer, of course, it means then you are going to have a higher volume of segments and service needs. Then, definitely, you’d have a good subsidy. So, nobody should be scared about pricing here, because the most important thing to consider is the value that you would derive from this, not even the price.

For instance, imagine going to these Western countries to purchase a bull, transport it to Nigeria, offload it, take it to your own farm, and then look at the possibility of it adopting the ecological system in Nigeria. Now, do the calculations and see. So it’s highly affordable, especially looking at the value that comes out with that.

For the youth, having one cow can help you to pay your school fees, even as a woman who has one cow in the backyard, and gets 20 litres of milk every day. When you sell 20 litres of milk, it can help you to cover lots of bills for the family. When you come to Livestock Genetics Africa, we encourage you, we train you, we guide you in different ways, especially the local farmers, the women, and the youth, so that they can see livestock farming as very constructive and interesting.

It’s not so difficult. You don’t need much education, or a lot of equipment. It’s just something you can do from your backyard. You can do it from anywhere; with the very small space you have. And that’s why we encourage you to do it.

What does a farmer need to set up a livestock farm for either dairy or beef?

Once you get in contact with Livestock Genetics Africa, you will be guided properly on what you should do. What we do is not only about profits. We are not only a profit-centered organisation, but we are a service provider that works with passion to help the country develop its livestock system, compared to the global developed system that we’ve come from. Our support is not only about our profit, but it’s also for the general development of the system. And then we want to change the understanding and people’s perception that livestock is for a particular segment of the people in society. This livestock is an economic venture that can be done by anybody, irrespective of their tribe, geographical location or gender. If you have one cow in a modern backyard, it can serve you a lot. You don’t need a big space once you are doing a modern system.

So, we are here to support the government and individuals to achieve these things in a way that is sustainable and beneficial. We supply not only the semen, but the expertise, the knowledge, so that people are guided on the modern system. As stakeholders in the Nigerian livestock project, we must support the system, especially with the coming of the Ministry of Livestock Development.",https://dailytrust.com/how-ai-can-boost-livestock-farmers-income,https://dailytrust.com
How Nigeria can generate $300m from shea nuts,"By Vincent A. Yusuf (Abuja) & Abubakar Akote (Minna)

Nigeria is the largest producer of shea butter in the world, with an annual production of 500,000 metric tonnes.

The global shea butter market, which is growing rapidly, is estimated at $5 billion by the end of this year.

SPONSOR AD

Nigerian shea nuts are highly sought after globally, particularly in cosmetics and food. Major importers include the US, UK, Germany, Japan and eastern Europe, notably Poland and Russia, which are growing markets.

Shea butter is used for chocolate, pastries and confections (as an alternative to cocoa butter), body creams and cosmetics, soaps, margarine, baking fat, cooking oil and candies, in addition to being a component of numerous pharmaceutical medications.

Shea trees grow naturally across Kwara, Niger, Kebbi, Kaduna, Kogi, Benue, Adamawa, Borno, Kaduna, Sokoto, Taraba, Ogun and Oyo states.

Although the country produces nearly 45 per cent of the global shea nut, it accounts for only 1 per cent of the market share of over $5 billion.

To address this imbalance, the federal government has been compelled to intervene to safeguard the domestic industry and increase the country’s advantages.

A few days ago, the federal government approved a six-month temporary ban on the export of raw shea nuts to curb informal trade, boost local processing, protect and grow Nigeria’s shea industry.

The ban, which is with immediate effect, is subject to review on expiration and specifically aimed at boosting Nigeria’s shea value chain to generate about $300 million annually in the short term.

Vice President Kashim Shettima, who announced the president’s directive on Tuesday, said the current situation is “unacceptable,” adding, “We are projected to earn about $300 million annually in the short term, and by 2027, there will be a 10-fold increase. This is our target.”

To make shea butter, which is highly sought after worldwide, shea kernels are utilised. After the butter is extracted, shea nut cake is produced, and is being utilised more and more as animal and poultry feed.

Going beyond ban

While stakeholders applauded the federal government for taking what they described as a “bold step” towards empowering the populace in the shea nut production sector, they said much needed to be done to process the shea nut so that it could meet the international market standards.

Ibrahim Akibu of the Regional Centre of Expertise, one of the stakeholders in the training of shea nut processors in Niger State, said unless the federal government backs the ban with a policy direction and provides necessary support to shea farmers, collectors and processors, the decision would not bring about any positive outcome.

“Our local processors need to be trained on international best practices to yield the desired results because it is not just about processing and export; there are high standards attached to some of these things, and international standards must be adhered to. And because our people don’t understand this, they would pack the raw nuts and sell them to our counterparts in Ghana, who understand these standards and follow them in processing it and adding value and exporting it to the world.

“We need to aggregate farmers and train them on best practices and provide them with the necessary machines or tools to be able to process better to the international standards. That is one key thing. Most of our farmers collect the raw shea nuts and sell them to Ghana because they know that if they process them, they won’t sell at the global market. And Niger State needs to be at the forefront because we have the largest deposit of shea trees in Nigeria and even on the African continent.

“If it is just a ban without any policy direction and support to the local shea farmers or collectors, this ban will not add any value. When it goes beyond the six-month ban with policy direction and support to local farmers and processors as well, there are more shea trees being planted and domesticated in our communities. That will help us a lot.

Nigeria can get more than $300m if…

Mr Shuabu Sani has been in the business of buying shea across Nasarawa, Kogi, and Benue states. He said Nigeria could generate more because the value chain products globally are very expensive.

“Go and price good, important shea butter cream and see how much it will cost you. Shea products are adjudged to be lucrative because they can be used to produce several products,” he said.

He said if the federal government is really serious about it and organises the production and value chain, it generates huge income for farmers and the country as a whole, adding that “unless that is done, it will just come nothing.”

Ibrahim Akibu told our correspondent in Minna that currently, “our local farmers in villages sell raw shea to buyers who usually penetrate our communities at giveaway prices because they don’t even know the value.”

He added, “One of the most important agricultural activities in Niger State is shea-nut collection, processing and marketing. But most of these collectors and processors are from poor households and are widely distributed in almost all the local government areas of the state. Notwithstanding the large number of people engaged in shea nut collection, processing and marketing in the state, the present economic gains from these activities appear to be marginal compared to the potential. There is high demand for shea butter in domestic and international markets, but this has not translated into adequately remunerative profits for producers in the state. This is largely due to low quality of shea butter obtained through the identified traditional methods of collection, processing and storage.”

Also speaking with Weekend Trust, Mohammed Abdulkadir, an engineer, the officer in charge of the Shea Tree Research Substation of the Nigerian Institute for Oil-Palm Research (NIFOR), Bida, Niger State, said there was need to improve on micro and macro processing.

“The order is a welcome decision, and kudos to this laudable initiative. But the government needs to support research findings and micro and macro processors to produce shea butter that meets international standards.

“Also, the government must empower research institutes on training and provision of small and medium shea processing equipment,” he said.

Absence of industrial plant a problem

The chief executive officer of NEXIM Bank, Abba Bello, a few days ago revealed that Nigeria produced 60 per cent of shea nuts globally but lacked industrial plants for quality processing.

He said the existing manual processing, mostly done by women in rural areas, did not meet global standards.

Bello said this while speaking at the inauguration of a shea butter processing plant established by Salid Agriculture Nigeria Limited, with support from NEXIM Bank in Kudu community, Mokwa Local Government Area of Niger State

He said that NEXIM Bank would continue to collaborate with the Salid Plant and the Niger State Government to achieve the whole value chain of shea nuts.

Following the inauguration of the processing plant, the Niger State governor, Mohammed Umaru, said the state government would plant 10 million shea trees to boost production of shea butter in the state.

Bago said the idea was to create employment for the teeming youths and women, as well as improve socioeconomic activities in the state and strengthen its status as the headquarters of shea trees.

He said 10,000 hectares of land would be prepared to plant the 10 million shea trees to feed the processing company and attract more investors to the state.

The chief executive officer of Salid Agriculture Nigeria Ltd, Ali Saidu, said the Salid Shea Butter Processing Plant in Kudu had the capacity to produce 30,000 metric tonnes of shea butter annually, and would increase capacity utilisation and enhance the quality of shea butter production in Niger State to compete with the global market.

The Niger State Commissioner for Investment and Trade, Aminu Takuma, said the establishment of the shea plant was a journey towards agricultural and industrial transformation.

The executive director of the Salid shea butter processing plant, Daniel Alabi, said the processing plant was born out of the desire to harness the abundant agricultural potentials of the state and empower local communities and contribute meaningfully to the economic advancement of the country.

The Salid shea butter processing plant in Kudu, Mokwa Local Government, is estimated to produce 100 metric tonnes of shea butter per day and projected to produce 30,000 metric tonnes annually.

Without shea policy framework, nothing will change

Stakeholders lamented that the lack of a workable policy would be a major issue that would frustrate shea butter processing and production in the country.

They said hundreds of shea trees were being cut on a daily basis for charcoal, timber and firewood in the state without afforestation.

In Nasarawa, Benue and Kogi states, shea trees have become endangered species because producers of mortars target them in the wild.

Niger State is estimated to have the largest collection of shea trees in the world, controlling about 54 per cent of all the trees in Nigeria and of the vaunted 325,000 metric tonnes of shea nut and butter exported from Nigeria.

Shea tree lifespan

It takes an estimated 11 to 15 years for a tree to reach fruit-bearing age, after which it can continue to bear fruit for up to 200 years. Each tree can produce roughly 15 kilogrammes of fruit. Turning the nuts or kernels from the shea butter tree’s fruits into butter is one of the finest ways to get the most out of it.",https://dailytrust.com/how-nigeria-can-generate-300m-from-shea-nuts,https://dailytrust.com
Gates foundation calls for shift in health financing,"The Gates Foundation says there is a need to rethink the role of Official Development Assistance (ODA) in health financing in Nigeria, calling for greater focus on maximising domestic resources.

Country Director of the Foundation, Uche Amaonwu, made the call while moderating a panel at the Agenda-2025 National Health Financing Dialogue with the theme: ‘Reimagining the Future of Health Financing in Nigeria’ organised by the Federal Ministry 9f Health and Social Welfare in Abuja.

Amaonwu stressed the need to scale up innovation of ODA, otherwise known as foreign aid, to better support national priorities and close the financing gap, decrying the serious impact of funding reductions on programmes in recent years

SPONSOR AD

He said earlier preparation could have helped mitigate the shocks.

“It’s unfortunate that we had to get to that shock, but we are here,” he added.

The country director noted that ODA should act as a catalyst to unlock larger streams of government and domestic financing.

Some charts presented during the session showed that ODA represents only a small fraction of total expenditure, reinforcing arguments that sustainable development depends on mobilizing local resources.

He cited examples which included Nigeria’s growing coalitions to optimize domestic financing, increased allocations at the state level, and steps toward greater local government autonomy.

“These are all things that I hope, we have heard the stories about the 200 million allocations. We have heard about the increase in allocations at state and local government level,” Amaonwu remarked.

“We have to advise and help the government to make better decisions on how to use the money.”

He also highlighted mechanisms, such as partnerships aligned with the Nigerian government’s priorities, as opportunities to drive meaningful change, expressing his optimism that current reforms could position Nigeria to make more efficient and sustainable use of its resources.

Foreign development partners also pushed for a new approach to support Nigeria’s transformation agenda.

Ms. Maria Kirova, the Africa Head of the Global Fund reiterated the importance of innovative financing instruments, expansion of health insurance coverage, and reforms to strengthen financial systems.

Kirova noted that the strategy is aimed to unlock additional resources and boost domestic capacity in line with Nigeria’s priorities.

She said, “So just remember three things here in which we as development partners can partner with Nigeria on its transformation agenda in three specific ways. Innovative finance instruments, expanding health insurance coverage and driving innovation and efficiency and transforming the financial systems.

“These are a few financial instruments that can be deployed to actually unlock the potential to mobilize additional resources to apply to the digital era.”

Kirova noted that the instruments highlighted use blended finance mechanisms, such as partnerships that deploy land resources to improve concessionality and subsidize repayment terms.

“The global fund has partnered with countries whereby land resources have been deployed to increase the concessionality of those from the non-electric development in the past by using the interest rate or by subsidizing the payments.

“This has allowed us access to much larger volumes and more affordable financing to address the domestic health priorities.

Leila Ben Amor, the head of cooperation, European Union delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS reiterated that financing is shifting towards more partnership and investment,” she added.",https://dailytrust.com/gates-foundation-calls-for-shift-in-health-financing,https://dailytrust.com
Cataracts: Don’t Let Your Sight Slip Away,"Cataracts are a leading cause of blindness globally, making up a huge percentage of the blind and visually impaired, according to the World Health Organisation. While it can affect people of all ages, its prevalence increases dramatically with age, ranging from as low as 3.9% in the 55-64 age group to 92.6% in those 80 and older. Although cataracts are a global issue, developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, face an excessively higher burden of cataract-related blindness.

In Nigeria, they are the primary cause of blindness and visual impairment, according to the Nigerian National Blindness and Visual Impairment Survey, which found that cataracts account for 43% of blindness and 45.3% of severe visual impairment. A more recent study indicated a 19.8% prevalence of cataracts in adults aged 40 and above, and it is higher in women, those with lower socioeconomic status, and those in rural areas.

Now, a cataract is a clouding of the eye’s natural lens, which is located behind the iris and pupil, and the lens is responsible for focusing light onto the retina, which then sends signals to the brain, allowing people to see. The lens is clear in a healthy eye. However, in an eye with a cataract, the proteins in the lens break down and clump together, scattering and blocking light from reaching the retina. This can cause hazy, blurry, or double vision, make colours seem faded, and increase sensitivity to light.

SPONSOR AD

Cataracts are primarily categorised by their location of formation and cause. Age-related cataracts are the most common. Cataracts can also be congenital (present at birth), secondary (caused by other conditions or medications), traumatic (from eye injury), or radiation-induced (from radiation exposure).

The truth is that many factors contribute to developing cataracts. As people get older, the lens proteins can break down and clump together, leading to clouding. A family history of cataracts can equally increase your risk, suggesting a genetic component to their development. Also, traumatic injuries to the eye can damage the lens and increase the risk of cataract development, especially in younger adults.

In addition, people with diabetes are at higher risk for cataracts. Conditions like glaucoma or uveitis can similarly contribute to cataract development. Certain systemic diseases like neurofibromatosis type 2, myotonic dystrophy, and atopic dermatitis can likewise be associated with cataracts. Also, long-term use of steroid medications, especially corticosteroids, can increase the risk of developing cataracts.

Furthermore, smoking is a risk factor for various health issues, including cataracts. Heavy alcohol use is also associated with an increased risk of cataracts. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun can damage the lens and equally contribute to cataract formation. Secondary cataracts often develop as a result of other eye conditions or surgeries, such as those involving the retina or vitreous humour.

Now, cloudy, blurry, or foggy vision is often the first noticeable symptom, as the cataract makes it harder for light to pass through the lens. There is difficulty seeing at night because the cataract scatters light, making it harder to see in low-light conditions. There is also increased sensitivity to light and glare, as bright lights, like headlights or sunlight, can be uncomfortable and cause squinting or difficulty seeing.

In addition, there can be halos around lights, as light can be distorted by the cataract, creating a ring of light around bright objects. Cataracts can also affect how colours are perceived, making them appear less vibrant or with a yellowish tint. Double vision (in one eye) can occur when the cataract disrupts the way light is focused on the retina. As the cataract progresses, vision will change, requiring more frequent adjustments to corrective lenses. Besides, there can be difficulty reading or doing other close-up tasks, as one may need more light or find it challenging to focus on fine details. Noteworthy is the fact that cataracts develop gradually, so one may not notice any symptoms at first.

Although there is no foolproof way of preventing cataracts entirely, several lifestyle choices and preventative measures can hugely reduce the risk and slow their progression. These include maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding smoking, managing other health conditions, and protecting your eyes from the sun. Regular eye examinations are also vital for early detection and management.

So, you need to be deliberate about a diet rich in vegetables, leafy greens, and colourful fruits. These are packed with antioxidants like zeaxanthin and lutein, as well as vitamins A, C, and E, which are beneficial for eye health. Instead of refined grains, eat whole grains, as they provide essential nutrients for eye health, and include foods rich in omega-3s, such as flaxseed oil, fish (tuna, salmon, etc.), and walnuts, or consider supplements.

In addition, avoid smoking, as smoking is a significant risk factor for cataracts, and quitting can reduce your risk and improve your overall health. You can consider seeking help from healthcare providers or support groups if you are struggling to quit.

It is also important to control blood sugar levels, as this is crucial for preventing cataracts, especially for individuals with diabetes, and manage your high blood pressure if you are hypertensive. Then protect your eyes from the sun by wearing sunglasses that block 100% of UVA and UVB rays. You may also consider wearing a hat with a brim to further shield your eyes. Equally crucial is scheduling regular eye exams with an eye doctor, especially after the age of 40, as early detection allows for timely intervention and management of cataracts and other eye conditions.

The only effective treatment for cataracts is surgery. So, if cataracts are causing vision problems that interfere with your daily activities, surgery can be carried out to remove the clouded lens and replace it with an artificial lens. In its early stage, stronger lighting and new glasses or contacts can help, but these are just temporary solutions, as cataracts worsen over time.

Cataracts are a common vision-impairing condition, particularly among older adults. You can considerably reduce your risk of developing them, and maintain healthy vision for as long as possible, by adopting preventative measures. However, if you are already experiencing vision changes, it is time to schedule an eye examination with an optometrist or ophthalmologist. Whatever the outcome, rest assured that help is available. But you need to seek it early to avoid the tragedy of complete vision loss.

Weed takes over abandoned hospital project,"A newly completed, multi-million naira hospital project in the Dobi community of the Gwagwalada Area Council in the Federal Capital Territory has been taken over by weed, Abuja Metro reports.

Our correspondent, who visited the 50-bed hospital on Tuesday, observed that weeds, grasses, and reptiles have taken over the entire facility.

It was also observed that some of the health centre’s ceilings are caving in, while some of the equipment inside the facility are covered in dust.

SPONSOR AD

Mr. Mohammed Usman, a youth leader in the community, who conducted our reporter round the facility, said the health centre was completed over a year ago but has not been put to use.

He explained that the 50-bed health centre was a constituency project facilitated by the FCT’s senator, Heebah Ireti Kingibe.

He added that the project was completed without being handed over to the community.

He noted that residents of Dobi and neighbouring villages were excited when the project was first sited in their community but have been left stranded without access to the facility for medical treatment.

According to him, the abandonment of the facility has taken a toll on patients who sometimes have to travel to Gwagwalada town or to a private hospital to seek medical attention.

He said the newly completed health centre, which was supposed to serve as a lifeline for residents and surrounding villages, has been abandoned.

“When Senator HeebahIretiKingibe came to lay the foundation of the health centre, the people of Dobi and the neighbouring villages saw it as a big relief. But since the facility was completed nearly two years ago, it has not been put to use. As you can see, weeds and grasses have taken over the facility,” he said.

Usman added that residents mostly depend on a single clinic built by the council authorities, which also serves patients from neighbouring villages.

He said that a few members of the youth group in the community have written to the senator’s aide about the need to commission and hand over the facility, but there has been no positive response for a year now.

“At least, if the facility is commissioned and handed over to the community, it will also be a credit to the senator herself, as the people she represents will feel the impact of her constituency project in the Dobi community,” he said.

In response, Mr. Emmanuel John, a legislative aide and head of Senator Kingibe’s constituency office, attributed the delay in commissioning and handing over of the facility to “administrative issues.”

According to him, the health centre has been completed, but the challenges lie with staffing and running costs, which he said are responsible for the delay.

He said the senator is already making moves to resolve the situation as part of her wider commitment to improve healthcare service delivery not only in the Dobi community but across the FCT.

“Actually, the health centre project in the Dobi community has been completed, but the bottleneck has been the management. I believe those challenges will be resolved. Any moment from now, the contractor will return to the site to tidy up the facility, and it will be put to use,” he said.

"FG, partners reaffirm commitment to safe schools on International Day to protect education","By Dalhatu Liman

The Federal Government has reiterated its commitment to safeguarding schools across Nigeria, as stakeholders gathered in Abuja to commemorate the 2025 International Day to Protect Education from Attack.

The event, held yesterday in Abuja, was themed “Challenging Narratives and Reshaping Actions”, and brought together government officials, development partners, and civil society actors.

In his opening remarks, Director of School Safety at the Federal Ministry of Education, Hussaini Aliyu Abdullahi, said the theme reflects a shift from reactive responses to proactive strategies.

“We are moving away from reactive measures and embracing proactive, practical steps to make our schools safer.

“Protecting education requires fresh thinking and real action,” he said.

He noted that the commemoration aligns with the Renewed Hope Agenda of Tinubu administration, which places education at the heart of national development.

“Mr. President has consistently emphasized that every Nigerian child, irrespective of background, deserves a safe, secure, and enabling environment to learn and thrive,” Abdullahi added.

The event featured cultural displays by students, school safety sensitization programmes, and visits to institutions such as the National Safe Schools Response Coordination Centre (NSSRCC), the NSCDC, and the Schools Protection Squad of the Nigeria Police Force.

NSSEC trains 100 FCT students in vocational skills,"By Dalhatu Liman

The National Senior Secondary Education Commission (NSSEC), in partnership with the Industrial Training Fund (ITF), has concluded the pilot edition of its Long Vacation Skills Acquisition Programme, training 100 senior secondary school students from the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in various vocational fields.

Speaking at the closing ceremony held at the ITF House, Maitama, the Executive Secretary of NSSEC, Dr. Iyela Ajayi, described the initiative as a strategic contribution to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda, which prioritises youth empowerment, education, and job creation.

“For two weeks, these young Nigerians have been exposed to hands-on training in critical skill areas such as POP design, tiling, plumbing, painting and decoration, solar panel installation, CCTV installation, catering and culinary skills, as well as robotics,” Ajayi said.

He noted that early exposure to entrepreneurial skills equips students to “innovate, compete and contribute meaningfully to national development.”

Ajayi also highlighted NSSEC’s recent strides, including the “Grow What You Eat” initiative to promote school farming, capacity building for teachers, and the development of minimum standards and a national policy for senior secondary education.

“These milestones would not have been possible without the support of the Honourable Minister of Education and the Honourable Minister of State for Education,” he said, adding that their leadership has driven progress in compulsory 12-year education, technical and vocational training, and inclusive access for girls and learners with special needs.

Addressing the students, Ajayi said, “You are leaving this programme not just with skills, but with a new mindset, a mindset of creativity, problem-solving and self-reliance.”

He thanked the ITF for its partnership and the FCT Education Secretariat for providing accommodation, ensuring the students were “properly housed, safe and comfortable.”

The ceremony marked a significant step in NSSEC’s efforts to reposition senior secondary education as a driver of national development through practical learning and inclusive policy reforms.",https://teentrust.ng/nssec-trains-100-fct-students-in-vocational-skills/,https://dailytrust.com

PR SHOTS: Manga Autos takes the ‘trophy’,"News that the owner of Manga Autos gifted ₦500,000 to Nafisah Abdullahi, the 17-year-old Nigerian who emerged world champion at the TeenEagle Global Finals, is heartwarming. It is a remarkable gesture that recognizes brilliance. But it also exposes the collective hypocrisy that our society’s reward culture is skewed and unserious about excellence, even as we tend to profess the contrary.

Nafisah’s triumph was no small feat, competing against over 20,000 participants from 69 countries, and clinching the top prize in a prestigious academic contest testing English, critical thinking, and communication skills. What did she and her team mates get? Government rewarded her with a ₦200,000 cash award, and then some scholarships, and commendations here and there, including from her home state, Yobe, and from the Atiku Abubakar Foundation. Truly commendable, but tokenistic in scale.

Contrast this with how athletes and entertainers are showered with apartments, cars, and tens of thousands of dollars, sometimes for winning a game or a fleeting competition. We have equally seen how deviant behaviour often attracts more public attention and rewards than discipline, scholarship, or integrity.

What message does this send to the next generation? That notoriety and spectacle pay more than intellect?

In some cases, we have seen an overreach. The tragedy of our skewed reward prioritization has recognized deviance, far too often.

This is not to diminish sports or entertainment, as they are equally deserving of recognition. But the disparity is glaring, and betrays a society that pays lip service to education while starving it of prestige. We cannot claim to value knowledge and innovation when those who achieve global intellectual milestones are barely acknowledged, except through private acts of goodwill.

If Nigeria is serious about competing in a knowledge-driven world, we must recalibrate how we honour excellence. Government, institutions, and corporate bodies should create reward systems that elevate intellectual achievement to the same level of visibility and generosity as sports. Scholarships, mentorship pipelines, and substantial incentives must follow our best and brightest, as a matter of equal or more priority.",https://teentrust.ng/pr-shots-manga-autos-takes-the-trophy/,https://dailytrust.com

The case for individualised behaviour plans in schools,"By Haarith Y. Agbaje

In today’s diverse educational landscape, a one-size-fits-all approach to student behaviour management is both outdated and ineffective. While universal behavioural approaches, such as school-wide rules, incentive programs, and standardised discipline systems, are designed to promote order and consistency, they often fall short when addressing the specific behavioural needs of individual students. Therefore, I strongly support schools creating individualized behaviour plans for students with unique needs.

Individualised behaviour plans are more effective in addressing complex student needs. A one-size-fits-all approach assumes that all students respond similarly to the same expectations and consequences. However, students with behavioural disorders, trauma histories, or other issues may not respond effectively to generalise strategies. An individualized behaviour plan allows educators to consider a student’s specific triggers, strengths, and goals, providing targeted interventions that support the student in a meaningful and respectful way.

Equity in education means giving each student what they need to succeed, not giving every student the same thing. Relying solely on universal behaviour strategies can marginalize students who struggle to conform to typical behaviour expectations due to factors beyond their control. Individualized behaviour plans promote inclusion by recognizing that each student is unique and deserves a fair opportunity to succeed in the classroom.

Students with behavioural difficulties are disproportionately affected by exclusionary discipline practices like suspension and expulsion. These punitive measures often fail to address the root causes of behaviour and can lead to academic failure or school dropout. Individualized behaviour plans, in contrast, focus on prevention, skill-building, and positive reinforcement.

While it is true that individualized plans require more effort and coordination, the benefits far outweigh the challenges. Individualized behaviour plans do not mean throwing away universal systems; instead, they build upon them to offer additional layers of support for students who need them most. A well-structured school can maintain consistency through general expectations while simultaneously using individualized strategies for students with persistent behavioural challenges.

In conclusion, while universal behavioral strategies provide a helpful starting point for managing student behavior, they cannot meet the needs of every child. Schools must embrace individualized behavior plans as a critical component of a comprehensive and inclusive behavior support system. By doing so, educators can address the unique needs of students, promote fairness, reduce disciplinary issues, and support academic success.

Electricity theft: Implications and consequences in the Nigerian electricity supply industry,"By Fatima Zayyan

Electrical theft also known as power theft or energy theft involves using electricity without paying for it. This can be done through various methods. They include: tempering with meters, bypassing them, or making illegal connections to the power grid.

According to science direct.com. It is an illegal act that can lead to a fine or imprisonment. It is the criminal practice of stealing electrical power.

Introduction

Electricity is the backbone of modern economies. It powers industries, households, healthcare, and innovation. In Nigeria, however, a large amount of electricity is lost, not just because of technical problems, but also due to a serious issue: electricity theft. This illegal use of electrical energy has become a common problem that affects the stability and growth of the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI).

From meter bypassing to illegal connections, electricity theft robs the country of important revenue, damages infrastructure, and scares away investors. As Nigeria continues to face unstable power supply and rising energy costs, fighting electricity theft is not just important, it is urgent.

This essay will look into the different types of electricity theft, how they affect the country, and the long-term damage they cause to the power sector and economy. It will also suggest practical solutions that can help reduce this problem and build a stronger, more reliable electricity system for all.

Forms of electricity theft in Nigeria

Electricity theft in Nigeria manifests in several forms, each with its own consequences. The most common is meter bypassing, where users deliberately tamper with their meters to reduce recorded consumption. Another widespread practice is illegal connections, where individuals or businesses connect to the power grid without proper authorization or payment. In some cases, this is done in collusion with corrupt officials from electricity distribution companies (DISCOs).

Estimated billing, which often results in overcharging, has also contributed to the public’s mistrust of the system. This has pushed some consumers to engage in illegal connections out of frustration and a sense of injustice.

Additionally, non-payment of electricity bills, whether through deliberate refusal or due to a general culture of entitlement to free services, further deepens the crisis and puts more strain on the power sector.

Implication for the Nigerian economy

The economic consequences of electricity theft are devastating. According to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) over N 100 Billion is lost annually due to energy theft and related inefficiencies (Naira metrics, 2023) for example the Ibadan electricity distribution company (IBEDC) reported monthly losses exceeding N3 billion due to theft and meter bypass (guardians 2024).

This loss in revenue makes it difficult to discuss pay for electricity generated by gencos (Generation companies) causing a ripple effect throughout the value chain. The shortfall leads to underinvestment in infrastructure stagnation in network expansion and ultimately poor service delivery; moreover honest consumers are penalized indirectly as they discuss increasing tariff to cover operational losses.

This undermines public trust and creates a cycle of inefficiency, distrust and resistance furthermore the sector’s instability scare off local and foreign investors who see while inactive to invest in a system that cannot guarantee returns due to rampant losses and weak enforcement mechanism.

Consequences on power supply and infrastructure

Electricity theft contributes significantly to the poor state of Nigeria’s power infrastructure, illegal connections often lead to the overloading of transformers and distribution lines causing frequent failures and blackouts the strain on infrastructure reduces the lifespan of critical equipment and makes maintenance both more frequent and more expensive.

Moreover technical and non-technical losses primarily due to theft result in loss of up to 40% of generated electricity according to a 2024 report (Guardian Nigeria) this means less electricity reaches legitimate consumers, leading to low voltage issues, load shedding and a national grid that struggles to meet demand

These consequences reinforce a vicious cycle the worse the service becomes the more consumers are tempted to bypass the system leading to even further degradation.

Social and legal consequences

Beyond economy and infrastructural cost electrically theft erodes the mental and legal fabric of the society. It normalizes corruption especially when officials are complicit. It also promotes unsafe living conditions, particularly in slums and informal settlements where illegal wiring poses significant fire and electrocution.

Legally the 2023 electricity act introduced higher penalties to curb the menace under this act, first time offenders are required to pay fines amounting to three times the value of the stolen electricity, while repeat offenders pay up to six times the value as well as possible commission term of up to three years.

Despite this, enforcement remains weak and public awareness of these penalties is limited, many Nigerians connive to see electricity theft as a survival tactic rather than a crime. Changing this mindset requires education transparency and trust in the system.

Government and stakeholder response

Several effects are being made by stakeholders to address electricity theft. The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has intensified monitoring and enforcement while promoting the installation of smart meters that are tamper proof and more accurate.

Distribution companies have also begun community engagement programs to educate customers on the dangers and consequences of theft. For instance, IBEDC and other discos regularly published data on theft causes – including b459 theft causes in just two months of 2024 (the cable)- to raise awareness and deter offenders.

Furthermore, there is increasing adoption of prepaid metering systems, which help reduce billing disputes and minimize opportunities for by-passing.

Recommendations

To reduce electricity theft in Nigeria, several key steps must be taken:

Strengthen the legal system: Electricity theft should be treated as a serious economic crime. Stronger laws must be enforced across all regions, without bias. The judiciary should handle such cases swiftly and fairly, regardless of the offender’s status or location.

Invest in smart technology: Smarter, tamper-proof meters should be installed nationwide. These devices must be affordable and paired with proper customer education to ensure users understand how to manage and monitor their electricity use.

Public awareness campaigns: A nationwide awareness effort should be launched using radio, TV, social media, and posters. These campaigns should educate the public on the dangers and consequences of electricity theft and promote responsible energy usage.

Fix estimated billing: Until all homes are metered, estimated billing systems must be fair and transparent. This will help reduce frustration among consumers and limit the temptation to bypass the system.

Support low-income consumers: To discourage illegal connections, the government should provide subsidies or promote alternative energy solutions, such as solar power, especially for vulnerable or low-income communities.

Meet the lucky Kaduna flower girl who welcomed both President and First Lady,"By Maryam Farouk

In a historic turn of events, 12-year-old Yusrah Abubakar Suleiman, a student of Evat Model School, Kaduna, has made history as the first flower girl in Nigeria to officially welcome both the First Lady and the President within a span of just three months.

Yusrah, who is affectionately known by family and friends as “the genius flower girl”, rose to national attention following her poised and graceful appearances during two major presidential visits. The first was when she welcomed First Lady Senator Remi Tinubu to Kaduna; the second came just months later, when she was again selected to welcome President Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.

The day I welcomed the First Lady, Remi Tinubu, to Kaduna with flowers was the biggest day of my life, Yusrah said. After she left, I never expected I would be chosen again, But less than three months later, I was called to welcome Mr. President which left my whole family in shock and excitement.

The nomination, according to Yusrah, came as a surprise even to her.

I just found myself being selected, it was my aunt who called my mother and told her about it. I am so grateful to Almighty God for the opportunity and to my parents for their constant support, she said.

Following both high-profile occasions, her family members and neighbors gave her playful nicknames such as “Yusrah the Capacitated Flower Girl,” “Celebrity Yusrah,” and “Uba Sani’s Favorite Girl.”

Her elder brother, Muhammad Abubakar Suleiman, expressed deep pride in her achievements:

“We felt so happy and very surprised because I never thought Yusrah would be nominated,” he said. “We chose her to be a flower girl because she has a passion for being a public figure and the fact is, she is truly a genius.”

He recalled the moment the family received the notification about her first appointment:

“I told her, ‘Yusrah, this is the beginning of your success.’ We both prayed for her. When she was called again to welcome Mr. President, our aunt even teased her, calling her the “capacitated flower girl.”

In a statement by Yusrah’s mother, she clarified that her daughter’s nomination was not a result of favoritism or internal influence.

“Actually, Yusrah didn’t have any connections. Her aunt works in the protocol office and nominated her for the First Lady’s visit. But for the President’s visit, even her aunt didn’t nominate her. The protocol team themselves recommended Yusrah to be the flower girl,” the mother explained.

As her story continues to inspire her peers, Yusrah remains humble and hopeful:

“I pray that all children around the world have bright futures,” she said.

From Kaduna to the nation, Yusrah has become a symbol of grace, humility, and inspiration proving that even the youngest voices can stand at the front of history.",https://teentrust.ng/meet-the-lucky-kaduna-flower-girl-who-welcomed-both-president-and-first-lady/,https://dailytrust.com
The debate between strict and lenient teachers,"By Muahdh Abubakar

The argument of whether a strict teacher or a lenient teacher is better has sparked a lively debate among my peers. A strict teacher ensures rules are obeyed, while a lenient teacher offers a more relaxed approach that can foster creativity and critical thinking. In my opinion, a lenient teacher is a better choice for students.

Lenient teachers provide students with the freedom to explore their ideas, creating an environment where learning feels like an adventure. This approach can lead to increased student engagement and motivation, as learners feel valued and understood. Students can develop a love for learning that extends beyond the classroom. Additionally, lenient teachers build strong connections with their students, care about their learning, and trust them to take ownership of their education.

A lenient teacher also plays a significant role in personal growth and development. They help students strategise their plans for the future, believe in themselves, and showcase their true skills and talents. By expressing their feelings and ideas in a supportive environment, students can thrive and reach their full potential. Lenient teachers make learning a fun and exciting experience, like an adventure in a world of wonders and mysteries.

In conclusion, while some may prefer strict teachers, I believe that a lenient teacher is a better approach. Lenient teachers offer numerous benefits, including increased student engagement, motivation, and personal growth. By providing a supportive and nurturing environment, lenient teachers can help students develop a love for learning that lasts a lifetime.

Why students should blog: 6 powerful benefits,"Blogging comes in many forms, it addresses countless topics, and it can, without a doubt, be divided by its quality. But when it comes to education, blogging can be an excellent tool for improving a students’ involvement, excitement, and most importantly, writing skills.

The benefits of blogging are tremendous, especially for young people. They can develop much improved writing skills which will stick with them forever, their thinking muscles will be in continuous development, and they will also develop a better understanding of the world that surrounds them.

Here are several reasons why students should start their own, personal blogs.

Blogging exercises student creativity

One of the best benefits that come as a result of blogging is that it allows people to express and hone their creativity. This can turn a boring paper into a fun creative process.

Bloggers always need to use their creativity and thinking to:

Develop unique and original content

Solve problems

Express their perspective and personality visually trough custom themes, headers, layouts, designs, and pictures.

Respond to their followers’ feedback and comments.

Besides, it’s also a fun and innovative process in which they can combine much of what they have learned.

Regular writing sharpens the brain’s performance

The development of a student’s thinking may be the most important benefit that comes with blogging. Many specialists talk about the phenomenon of how daily writing (content, thoughts, experiences, fantasies, or anything you want) improves and sharpens your brain’s performance.

Blogging helps you connect the dots better and faster. You should encourage each of your students to develop their personal blog and create a portfolio around it. It will help them big time when they seek their first jobs!

Promote expression of self

In the traditional classroom, the students’ audience is mainly the teacher and perhaps, sometimes, parents and the classmates. If a student were to blog regularly, she will reach a broader audience, and can receive constructive feedback.

Blogging gives students purpose, this being a crucial aspect of every personal motivation. Also, when a student starts a platform, he would feel the need to consistently provide his audience with good information. These are aspects that truly cant be found in the traditional classroom learning system.

Blogging Boosts Confidence

People that own blogs report critical changes in their lives. Many of them suggest that they have found themselves or that they have finally understood. This may sound like a spiritual breakthrough, but it is not.

In fact, what most people want to say is that their confidence levels have improved. They are no longer afraid to speak what they hold in their minds, and they feel less pressure to conform to the standards.

Improve Communication Skills

Writing, after all, is simply a type of communication that people use in order to exchange thoughts and feelings. Let’s keep it simple: if your students write something for their blog every day, they will express their thoughts and feelings on a consistent basis. The more they practice through blogging, the better communicators they will become.

Earn Income!

Are your students aware of how much money can be made with blogging? Are you?

Indeed, writing is a skill that never goes away. Just like you learn how to drive once, your writing skills will stick with you no matter what. Many bloggers find aside work, writing for extra income.

If your students want to take their blog to the next level, they can start monetizing it by doing affiliate marketing, e-commerce, consulting, and so on.

Takeaways

The world is evolving. Along with it, so do many aspects of our existence. Ten years ago, very few people were affording an iPhone, only a few were able to access information on the web while mobile, and blogging was a relatively new thing. Now? Everything is slowly turning to digital. Blogging is a great way to reflect, sharpen writing skills, express yourself, and gain know-how that can benefit students in many ways.",https://teentrust.ng/why-students-should-blog-6-powerful-benefits/,https://dailytrust.com

By expanding their range of income sources and applying both artistic and academic skills, students can guide their academic years with financial security and gain valuable professional experience, allowing them to establish a strong foundation for a future career in the arts.",https://teentrust.ng/how-to-make-money-as-a-visual-art-student/,https://dailytrust.com
How friends influence one another–for better or worse–in high school,"High school students face many of the same friendship dynamics as elementary and middle school students, yet friendship operates in distinct ways in these later adolescence years. The buffering effect friends provided in earlier childhood, for example, seems to disappear. “Not only did the presence of friends not reduce stress,” writes Lydia Denworth in the 2020 book Friendship: “It made things worse. Cortisol levels went up.”

By the time students reach high school, friendships become more stable. “In middle school, it’s unusual for an individual to maintain the same group of close friends over the space of 18 months,” says B. Bradford Brown, an educational psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison: “In high school, that is no longer the case.”

Likely because individual identities are more solidified, older teens tolerate greater dissimilarity in one another. As a result, compromise and collaboration increasingly take the place of conformity.

Like friendship churn, concern over one’s reputation in broader groups peaks in middle school (and early high school). That leaves most high school students relatively less worried about their larger reputation and more focused on the social dynamics within their chosen peer groups, Brown says.

By the tenth grade, teens tend to interact more with romantic partners than anyone else, and research Laursen has been part of shows that as adolescents become involved in romantic relationships, their drinking increasingly mirrors that of their partners rather than their friends.

Peer influence as a positive?

As a predictable corollary, romantic partners begin to exert more influence than friends in high school, and friend groups more than larger crowds.

Most educators know the basics of peer pressure. One famous study showed that the number of one’s friends using drugs is the biggest determinant of drug use. We also know that when peers are present, adolescents take more risks (for example, teenage males drive faster in the presence of other teenage boys).

But recent research reveals a twist: It’s not necessarily because of any direct egging on. Just presence is enough, because the reward centers of adolescents’ brains are more active with peers than when alone, according to the research of Temple University’s Laurence Steinberg.

For her book, Denworth tracked him down as well as Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, a professor of psychology and cognitive neuroscience at University of Cambridge, who explained the academic upside: “Risk taking in an educational context is a vital skill that enables progress and creativity.”

That’s just one positive lens on peer influence. Scott Gest, a University of Virginia professor, says: “People talk about negative peer influence … but they neglect the pretty substantial literature that shows a lot of negative behavior of high school kids is discouraged by friends.

There is a lot of very positive pressure that peers apply, like, ‘No man, that’s stupid.’” This “obstructing” is one of the many underreported modes of peer influence, Brown says. There’s also teasing, reinforcement such as laughing or nodding, and creating situations that facilitate a certain type of behavior, like throwing an unchaperoned party.

None of these modes is inherently good or bad, Brown points out. A teen could just as easily create a situation conducive to altruism, like asking a friend to meet them at the food pantry before a concert, knowing full well they’ll end up handing out meals for a few minutes—or cracking a joke about tongue brushing that reinforces oral hygiene.

“Behavioral display,” or modeling that leads to emulation, is another type of peer influence. In one 2018 study of college freshmen, researchers found “having friends with higher propensities to study is predictive of receiving higher freshman grades.” Because the study looked at both assigned roommate pairings and chosen friend groups, the researchers were able to show the effect wasn’t just a reflection of “selection bias,” with studious kids having already chosen to befriend each other.

Hanging out with someone studious, they concluded, caused adolescents to study for more hours and post higher grades. The findings confirm previous research showing a correlation between how a child views the importance of doing well in school and how their friends do.

Similar effects have been demonstrated for volunteer work and health-promotive behaviors, such as exercise. Positive change has also been documented in high school students dating high-functioning peers.

What does all this mean for educators? Influential students can be explicitly tapped to improve classroom dynamics. In one program, kids were trained to publicly encourage anti-conflict norms. Disciplinary reports of student conflict dropped 30 per cent over one year.

This success may be owed in part to the fact that the program enlisted kids’ help. Efforts that engage teens in actual, real-life tasks have been the most promising when it comes to changing the content of the values transmitted within adolescent peer groups.

Other successful efforts to “benevolently exploit peer influence,” include using small group discussions to combat bullying.

Even greater benefits of cooperation

A cousin of peer influence is collaboration, and high school students get unique benefits from it. Carefully structured cooperative learning experiences have been tied to students exerting greater effort and using higher-level reasoning strategies more frequently, ultimately boosting achievement and decreasing problematic behaviors, according to the research of Michigan State University’s Cary Roseth.

What’s more, “in a study of high school seniors,” he reports, “a predisposition to work with peers cooperatively was found to be highly correlated with psychological health.”

The promise of boosted academic and social-emotional learning doesn’t always have to mean group assignments though. Laursen says by high school “many kids hate these sorts of paired activities when a grade is riding on the product.”

On the other hand, they appreciate the opportunity to work alongside a peer on their own work. Friends are distributed over classes so the bump students see from working with someone they like and trust may be easier to get in a study hall setting where students undertake, in toddler parlance, “parallel play” or “being with.”

Both logistical benefits and moral support can also be fostered in a high school class with no preexisting friendships. One small Australian study of first-year university students showed that when students discussed class content outside of class, they were more likely to progress to second year. Friends provided feedback, reassurance, and encouragement that “increased students’ emotional engagement, their enthusiasm and interest in the course content and in the classroom.” The study’s authors ultimately encouraged teachers to instruct students to talk to each other during breaks, exchange contact information, and consider arranging study sessions.

During distance learning this fall, Mira Debs, executive director of Yale’s education studies program, had students write introductions. She hosted a weekly virtual lunch. One student set up an optional group text message chain for the class. Each of these actions increases a sense of belonging—which in turn boosts motivation—and also provides students with tangible resources.

Elizabeth Self, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University, explains how these college-level findings relate to teens: “If you think about an AP class—high workload, high stress—the way that kids can come together to study, the way they come together to share notes, the way they come together to figure out an assignment …. For those that do, it’s a huge advantage.”

Technology and distance

With schools across the country closed, child development experts worry most about the future of our youngest learners. After all, high school students already had mechanisms in place for connecting at a distance, practices like exchanging Snapchat videos about the parts of the homework that don’t make sense.

But Denworth says we can’t discount “Zoom fatigue.” In a recent article for Psychology Today, she describes a book called Relating Through Technology by Jeffrey Hall, a professor of communication studies at the University of Kansas. He told Denworth, “Compared to face to face, texting and using social media, energy use during a Zoom call is higher.” Disruptions like your own image, delays, and cross-talk make video calls more intense. They also heighten loneliness: “Zoom is exhausting and lonely because you have to be so much more attentive and so much more aware of what’s going on than you do on phone calls.”

And even though teens can socialize virtually, Brown says, “the intensity of seeing close friends and romantic partners in person is difficult to give up, so the lack of those face-to-face opportunities is going to create anxiety.” Their developmentally appropriate craving for intimacy is what drives “the way that individuals 18 to 25 are behaving right now,” he says, “having real difficulty engaging in social distancing, wearing a face covering, and staying feet apart.”

While distance learning may work best for teenagers, everything we know about friendship in late adolescence suggests they too would benefit from in-person learning experiences at the earliest safe opportunity.

How to earn extra cash through Surveys,"As a teen, there are some ways you can get extra cash. One of them is taking online paid surveys for teens online. They are usually very easy to take and will give you enough pocket money for you to start saving up. Whether you want to buy a few new video games or put money away to buy a car in a few years, getting paid to answer online surveys for money is well worth the effort.

How do online paid survey sites work?

Before a brand releases a new product, they need to know who is willing to buy it. After all, brands need to create ads to impress their customers, right? They can only do this (and make money from their product) if they understand who their target audience is.

Market research companies help brands learn more about their customers. They do this by sending quizzes to online survey sites for teens. Then, teenagers give their valued opinions on the questions asked and get paid. You can also earn your points and redeem them for Amazon gift cards and other types of virtual rewards.

On top of that, sometimes users of these online survey websites can be invited to do product testing, meaning they will get some money and a product to test at home through the mail.

Most sites let you earn points for completing surveys online. Then, once you have amassed enough, your points can be redeemed for cash or gift cards. It’s that simple! Taking teen surveys is a great way to earn some easy pocket money.

Are paid online surveys safe?

There are a lot of rules that survey sites for teens have to follow. In other words, survey panels can’t do whatever they want with your answers. Rather, there is a protocol they have to follow, completely dictated by the Federal Trading Commission (FTC).

It’s this agency that ensures your data is safe with these online paid surveys. You can take all the paid surveys online you want and rest assured all your answers will be completely anonymous.

How old do you have to be to do online paid surveys?

Age is a very important factor to look out for. Most survey panels that are kid-friendly say you have to be at least 13 years old or older. (The few exceptions are the handful of survey sites for kids under 13 years old.) However, each website is entitled to have a minimum age requirement.

Different survey sites have varying age requirements. For example, Survey Junkie requires users to be at least 12 years old, whereas Branded Surveys and LifePoints require a minimum age of 16. It’s essential to check the age requirements for each survey site before signing up. If you aren’t old enough, you can’t get paid!

How much can you make from online paid surveys?

When you take surveys for money you earn points for completing tasks. Then, those points can be redeemed for gift cards, prizes, or cash.

Every platform is different, so what you get (including how much) varies. The best let you make a couple of dollars every day, although there are survey websites out there paying less than a dollar per day. Choose whichever one you like best!

Are online surveys easy to complete?

Yes, taking surveys for money is extremely easy. Think of it like taking a test—only you don’t have to study for it and there are no right or wrong answers. You will be giving your opinion on what the survey asks you. Easy, right? All it takes is some free time and that’s that. In fact, this is one of the easiest ways to earn rewards and make money online for free.

How to make money on YouTube,"Every day, the world watches 1 billion hours of YouTube videos. The platform’s immense popularity has transformed it from an entertainment channel to a powerful monetization tool for businesses and personal brands.

So, if you’re interested in making money on YouTube, now is a great time to get started. We suggest beginning by using a website builder to host your videos and to have a home for your brand, and then sharing your content on YouTube. Not only will this expand your reach, but it will also help you make money from your fans.

Become a YouTube Partner

Once you start a YouTube channel, you can join the YouTube Partner Programme to get access to special monetization features, including the ability to serve ads, display merchandise and more.

While joining is completely optional, it does give you access to a variety of channels for making money, including Premium subscription fees and a merchandise shelf. Here’s how to become a YouTube Partner:

Step 1: Stay compliant with the guidelines

When you first apply to the Partner Program, YouTube will review your channel for compliance. For this reason, you should get acquainted with the platform’s monetization policies, and make sure your content abides by the rules every time you upload a YouTube video.

Your content will be under continual review, even as you grow your channel and start to make money from it. If you do get accepted as a Partner, keep tabs on the latest compliance policies to make sure you’re up-to-date.

Step 2: Meet the YouTube Partner Program requirements

In order to join the program, you’ll need to become a successful YouTuber. The criteria for joining are that your channel has reached 4,000 watch hours and 1,000 subscribers within the past 12 months, or 1,000 subscribers with 10 million valid public Shorts views within the past 90 days. Only once you’ve met or surpassed these numbers can you apply to become a YouTube Partner.

Step 3: Apply to join the programme

Provided you meet the necessary requirements, you can submit an application to join the program following these steps:

Go to the top right of the YouTube homepage. Click your account icon and select Creator Studio.

On the left-hand side, click Channel. Then, select Status and Features.

Under the box that says Monetization, click Enable.

Agree to the YouTube Partner Program Terms.

Step 4: Set up AdSense

As part of the application process, you’ll need to set up an AdSense account associated with your profile to ensure you’ll earn money from your videos and get paid. Keep in mind that you can only have one such account, and that multiple channels can be linked to the same account.

Step 5: Get reviewed

Once you’ve applied to be a YouTube Partner and set up an AdSense account, your channel will be put in a queue for review. At this point, both automated systems and humans will check your channel for full compliance with the guidelines.

Step 6: Explore your monetization options

If you’re accepted by YPP, congratulations! It’s time to set up your ad preferences and enable monetization.

You can choose from a wide range of YouTube monetization options, but keep in mind that they each have different eligibility requirements:

Advertising revenue: Earn money by including display, overlay or video ads next to your content. To do this, you must be at least 18 years old or have a legal guardian who agrees to handle your payments. Your content must also meet the advertiser-friendly content guidelines.

Channel memberships: Offer special perks to Channel members who make recurring monthly payments. This requires that you’re at least 18 years old and have more than 30,000 subscribers.

Merchandise shelf: Showcase official branded merchandise on your watch pages for your fans to browse and buy. For this option, you must be at least 18 years old and have more than 10,000 subscribers.

Super Chat and Super Stickers: Make money from fans who pay to get their messages highlighted in chat streams. You must be at least 18 years old and live in a country where Super Chat is available.

YouTube Premium revenue: Get part of a YouTube Premium subscriber’s membership fee when they watch your videos.

Sell merchandise

Another way to make money on YouTube is by selling merchandise. You can offer products you’re already selling on other platforms, or you can create a new collection based on your channel’s content. Keep in mind that you’re far more likely to make sales if your videos already have a fan following, so focus on building your popularity before you start producing such products.

Step 1: Design your products

Your merchandise should represent your brand, appeal to your target audience and build a community around your channel. As you dream up your products, think of something relevant to your niche that your viewers would be interested in. Note that you can check your YouTube analytics to get a better understanding of the kinds of people interested in your content.

For instance, if your channel is about makeup or beauty, you might want to sell branded cosmetics or makeup bags. On the other hand, if you’re a YouTube fitness instructor you might consider selling branded fitness equipment and energy bars. You can also poll your audience to ask about which kinds of products interest them the most.

Step 2: Source and build your products

Now, it’s time to make your product ideas come to life. You’ll likely need a manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer to produce and deliver your products to you. You can also try dropshipping, a method by which the manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer ships the products to customers directly.

Whichever method you choose, be careful not to overstock at the beginning. Instead, start with just 1-2 products and produce them in small amounts. That way, you’ll have time to gauge their popularity and estimate how many people will buy.

Step 3: Start an online store

To handle transactions, you’ll need to create an online store. This will allow you to manage end-to-end fulfillment, accept secure online payments and more. Having your own professional eCommerce site will also boost your brand’s credibility while providing a dedicated platform for your audience to browse through your merchandise.

Step 4: Enable your merchandise shelf

If you’re a YouTube Partner, you can also take advantage of YouTube’s inbuilt merchandise shelf. This lets you display up to 12 official branded products on the video page of your channel so that you can showcase the items to your viewers.

Step 5: Promote the products in your YouTube videos

Once you’ve created your products and set up a website, spread the word by promoting them in your videos. Think of creative ways to present the merchandise to viewers, such as wearing or using it or featuring customers with your products.

Conclude your videos by reminding users to like, subscribe, and check out your website. You should also add a link to your online store in the description section so that users can navigate seamlessly to your website and make a purchase.

Use fan funding

Another option for making money on YouTube is fan funding. While crowdfunding platforms target a general crowd for donations, fan funding specifically sources funds from your audience.

Join a fan funding platform

You can get started with fan funding by joining a dedicated platform. One of the most popular is Patreon, which provides tools for content creators to get recurring, long-term support from their fans.

Best way Teens can make money Tutoring Online,"If you want to make money online as a teenager and are knowledgeable in a certain subject, the idea of becoming an online tutor might have crossed your mind.

Online tutoring is a very popular way to make money online. After all, experienced tutors can easily earn $15 to $25+ per hour, or even more!

However, finding online tutoring jobs for teens can be tricky because many tutoring gigs require you to be 18 or older or to even have a bachelor’s degree.

But, if you want to become an online teen tutor, you’re not out of options!

What do you need to become a teenage tutor?

Generally speaking, you need to be in the top percentile of a certain subject to be a good tutor. This is because you need to know the material you’re teaching like the back of your hand so you can effectively teach it.

Aside from that, some other requirements you’ll probably encounter for online teen tutoring jobs include:

Reliable Internet: You need to have stable, decent internet speed for pretty much any teen tutoring gig.

A Headset & Microphone: This isn’t always a requirement, but some online tutoring jobs for teens require you to have a headset and mic to instruct with.

A Friendly Persona: While you might tutor kids your own age, you’re probably tutoring students who are younger than you and in elementary school. It’s important to be friendly and patient as a tutor and to adapt your teaching style to each student.

Spare Time: Taking on an online tutoring job as a teen means you have to set time aside from your studies, extracurricular activities, and your spare time, so keep this in mind.

Also note that some online tutoring jobs for teens might require having your TEFL certification if you plan to teach English as a secondary language to people.

Benefits of online tutoring jobs for teens

Now that you know some of the best online tutoring jobs for teens, let’s cover why this is such a great side hustle idea for students in the first place.

Here are the main perks high school students should think about when considering this job:

High Hourly Pay: Online tutors can easily earn $15 to $25+ per hour, so it’s likely you can earn more than most part-time, minimum wage jobs.

Expands Your Resume: When you apply for college or university, you can put your tutoring experience on your resume to stand out from the crowd

Entrepreneurial: If you start your own tutoring business, you’re gaining first-hand experience at what it’s like to run your own business.

Flexible: An advantage of tutoring jobs is that you can usually set your own hours and work with your pupils after school, so this job won’t interfere with your studies.

How to get tutoring jobs for teens

There are two main ways to become a teenage tutor:

Find Online Jobs: A few companies hire tutors under the age of 18, so you can apply for open positions to find online work.

Try Freelancing: This is the best way to become an online tutor as a teenager in my opinion since you’re not restricted by your age and you can usually earn more money if you find your own clients.

Freelancing takes more time to get started, but I really think this option is best for teens since most tutoring companies require you to be 18 or older.

But when you turn 18 in your final year of high school, you can apply to larger tutoring companies, like Tutor.com, Preply, VIPKid, Student-Tutor, HappyTutors, and dozens of more companies that are always looking for new tutors to join.

The best online tutoring jobs for teens

If you’re ready to start a new digital side hustle and want to help other students, it’s time to dive into the top online tutoring jobs for teens you can use to make money as a teenager!

Here are some of the online platforms you can explore

PalFish

If you want to teach English online to students in China, PalFish is one of the easiest tutoring jobs to land.

Most ESL tutoring jobs require you to be 18 or older, have lots of previous teaching experience, and hold a bachelor’s degree.

So, while companies like VIPKid and QKids are very popular for older tutors, they aren’t viable online tutoring jobs for teenagers.

Thankfully, the requirements to become a PalFish tutor are quite lenient:

Teach from your smartphone or a tablet through the PalFish mobile app

Be an English native speaker

Be friendly and patient with students

Have your TEFL/TESOL certification

PalFish doesn’t state anything about an age requirement, so really, the main requirement is getting your TEFL/TESOL certification.

However, you can find affordable TEFL/TESOL courses on Groupon, so there aren’t many starting costs with this tutoring gig. Plus, PalFish is also a more laid back tutoring job than most ESL tutoring jobs that require teaching a set curriculum.

As a PalFish tutor, you set your own rate per minute, and all you have to do is chat in English with your pupils.

PalFish takes 20 per cent from tutors, and on average, PalFish tutors earn $12 to $17 per hour on average.

Pros: Lenient hiring requirements, high hourly wage.

Cons: Takes a while to find clients on PalFish.

Age Requirement: PalFish doesn’t have an official age requirement for tutors.

Average Pay: $12 to $17 per hour.

Fiverr Tutoring Gigs

While it might surprise you, another way to find online tutoring jobs for teens is to list your services on Fiverr.

Fiverr is a bustling freelancer marketplace, and you can actually create an account and use the platform as young as 13 years old.

So, if you can teach a particular subject or skill, you can list your services on Fiverr and try to attract clients.

I’ve made money with Fiverr before selling other skills. And, in my opinion, it’s an excellent way to make money online for beginners since it has so much opportunity.

Fiverr is also quite popular for tutoring, and you can get paid to answer questions for subjects like:

Economics

Languages

Math

Programming

Religious studies

Science

Statistics

Of course, some of these subjects are probably a little advanced for a teenage tutor, but you can get really creative with Fiverr.

For example, some sellers on Fiverr teach people how to play instruments over the internet.

You can also find people offering online coaching services for different video games or general life coaching, so there’s plenty of room to get creative here.

Care.com

Care.com is a popular marketplace for services like elderly care, babysitting, cleaning, and running errands.

But, what might surprise you is that Care.com also lets you post online tutoring services, and plenty of people use the platform to find tutors for various subjects.

Some of the most popular tutoring categories include:

English

French

Math

Homeschool tutors

Homework help

Physics

Spanish

What’s great about Care.com is that if you’re between the ages of 14 and 17, a parent or legal guardian can create an account for you and help you apply for jobs.

Now, this isn’t the go-to platform to find online tutoring gigs for teens since most of the tutors on the platform are over 18.

But, if you want to try another marketplace, Care.com is worth a shot.

Plus, a lot of gigs pay around $16 to $25 per hour or pay a set amount per week for a dedicated number of hours, so the pay is quite competitive.

Pros: High-paying tutoring gigs and a variety of subjects.

Cons: Most of the tutors on Care.com are college tutors or are older.

Age Requirement: 14 or older with a parent or guardian’s permission.

How to earn money online by selling products or services,"Engaging in online service reselling is an exceptional way to generate income without the need for traditional employment.

This business model, also known as service flipping, involves purchasing services at a lower cost and reselling them at a higher price, allowing you to profit from the difference.

One of the most enticing aspects of this business is that it requires no upfront capital. Unlike traditional businesses, you receive payment from your clients before procuring the services from a service provider.

Service flipping is particularly well-suited for young adults seeking to earn money from freelancing without performing the actual work themselves.

There are several ways to earn money online by selling products or services. Here are a few options:

How to Resell Fiverr Gigs

Before you begin offering your flipped services to the general public, you must first complete a few steps.

Open a Fiverr account

This is the first and most basic step. Open a new Fiverr account via this link in order to get 20% off from your first order. It only takes a few minutes to create an account. You don’t have to be overly cautious when creating your profile because you’re registering as a buyer.

Select a Niche

It’s mind-boggling how many freelance jobs you can offer. On Fiverr alone, there are dozens of subcategories spread across eight categories.

However, when it comes to reselling, some jobs perform better than others. Jobs that can be easily resold must meet certain criteria.

There must be a reasonable amount of demand.

The supply must not be oversaturated.

It should be possible to buy it for a lower price and sell it for a slightly higher price.

There must be some sellers who have over a thousand reviews.

It is preferable if an order does not take too long to complete.

While these criteria may appear to be extremely difficult to meet, some categories and subcategories of services fit in perfectly.

They are, however, fairly simple to make, and someone who is used to doing them can complete an order in a couple of hours.

However, training for this job takes more time than most people are willing to invest, so supply remains relatively low.

Some of the best Fiverr gigs to resell includes:

eBook formatting

eBook writing

eBook cover design

Article writing

Voice over acting

Producing explainer videos

Translation

Design of advertisements

Writing sales copy

Logo design

Subtitling

Select a Platform

Following that, you need to make arrangements for a platform you will use in delivering your reselling services. You’ll need a website on which customers can place orders. There, you can offer a variety of services with numerous variations, as well as get the offers you want to sell.

WordPress

Creating a website for the reselling of Fiverr gigs on WordPress will cost you a few bucks but this is the best way to make the most profit from flipping services. With a WordPress service website, you have complete control over the monetization of your business.

WordPress.org is the best website hosting platform. You will need to pay for a domain name and web hosting. Bluehost is an excellent choice for this.

After downloading WordPress from your Bluehost account, you need to create a few essential pages for your website, such as your offers, contact page, privacy policy, portfolio page, blog, terms of service, and so on. You can do this yourself or get a full professional drop servicing website built for you for cheap on Fiverr.

Upwork

You can also use Upwork as your gig reselling platform. That is, you can sign up for Upwork and offer your services. When you get a client, you can delegate the work to your freelancer on Fiverr.

This entails profitably flipping Fiverr gigs without creating a website for your business.",https://teentrust.ng/how-to-earn-money-online-by-selling-products-or-services/,https://dailytrust.com
"UPDATED: FG gifts teenager who won global English contest N200,000","The Federal Government, on Thursday, gifted the winner of the TeenEagle global finals competition, Nafisah Abdullahi, N200,000.

Recall that the Atiku Foundation rewarded the TeenEagle champions, namely Nafisa Abdullahi, Rukaiya Fema, and Khadija Kalli, with fully-funded scholarships following their outstanding performance at the TeenEagle Global Finals.

The girls, who emerged as global winners in various categories of the prestigious academic competition, were recognised by the Foundation for what it described as their “remarkable success.”

At a special recognition ceremony in Abuja on Thursday, the Minister of Education, Dr. Tunji Alausa, alongside the Minister of State for Education, Professor Suiwaba Ahmad, celebrated Nafisa’s remarkable feat and other students who excelled during the competition.

They described her as “a beacon of excellence and inspiration to Nigerian youths.”

Representing Nigeria through the Nigerian Tulip International College, Nafisa outshone more than 20,000 participants from 69 countries, including native English-speaking nations, to clinch the world title.

TeenEagle competition is an internationally acclaimed contest that evaluates students’ proficiency in the English language, critical thinking, and communication skills.

Speaking at the event, Alausa said the Federal Government was laying the groundwork for stronger foundational education to reduce the number of out-of-school children in the country.

He stressed that President Bola Tinubu has demonstrated a strong commitment to human capital development through increased investment in education, health, and social protection.

“You are the future of Nigeria, and you have made us proud. For the first time in the history of our nation, we have one of the highest budgetary allocations to education.

“Each time we approach the President for support in the sector, his response has been a resounding ‘yes’ because he believes in you, the children of Nigeria.

“Your success gives us the confidence to ask for more, and we will continue to do so on your behalf,” the minister said.

The minister also announced a gift of over N100,000 to Nafisa and her other colleagues who excelled in other fields.

On her part, Ahmad commended Nafisa’s resilience, intellect, and determination, pledging the Federal Government’s continued support for young talents who bring honour to the nation.

“Nigerian youths can compete and excel globally. Nafisa has demonstrated that Nigeria is blessed and can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the best in the world. You are a shining example,” she said.

She urged the teenager to see the achievement as the beginning of a greater journey, while commending her parents and teachers for providing the foundation for her success.

Responding, Nafisa appreciated Tinubu and the ministers for creating an environment for her to excel while thanking her school, NTIC and her parent for the support.

The Yobe state Commissioner for Basic Education, Prof. Abba Idris, thanked the minister for his gesture.

He also noted that the state government has continued to celebrate milestones in the education sector.",https://teentrust.ng/updated-fg-gifts-teenager-who-won-global-english-contest-n200000/,https://dailytrust.com
"I lost a companion, mother of hanged daughter narrates ordeal","“She was a young, innocent girl, full of life. But as fate would have it, we lost her in a mysterious manner. I wonder what an innocent child like Fatima could have done to anyone to warrant this cruel act.” These were the sorrowful words of Malama Madina Inuwa Makwalla, the mother of the late Fatima Sulaiman, whose body was found hanging in her home.

The mother and other family members are mourning the tragic death of 13-year-old Fatima, a Junior Secondary School (JSS II) student at Sheikh Bashir Isyaka Rabiu Girls Secondary School, Goron Dutse. The quiet neighborhood of Dandinshe Yamma Quarters in the Dala Local Government Area of Kano State has been plunged into grief and shock by the mysterious circumstances surrounding her death.

Fatima, described by her parents as a patient, loving, and respectful girl, was found dead on Saturday evening in her family residence. The details of her death have raised troubling questions about safety, security, and justice in the ancient city.

According to family accounts, the Sulaiman household had planned to visit a family friend who had recently acquired a new house in Kano. As they prepared to leave, Fatima told her mother she would quickly return home to use the toilet and take a bath before rejoining them. She reportedly locked the gate after re-entering the house. Neighbors later testified that after freshening up, Fatima was seen standing outside the gate as dusk settled over the neighborhood. That was the last time she was seen alive.

When the family returned later that evening, Fatima’s elder sister, Rahila Sulaiman, was the first to try to enter the house. She found the gate locked from the inside and alerted her mother, Malama Madina Inuwa Makwalla. Together, they tried to open the gate with a spare key, but their efforts failed.

Moments later, Fatima’s father, Malam Sulaiman, returned from the market. He, too, was unable to unlock the gate. Growing anxious, he decided to scale the wall into the compound. What he saw inside will remain etched in his memory forever.

Inside the house, Malam Aminu found his young daughter hanging lifelessly by the window, her neck visibly broken. Shocked and devastated, he raised an alarm, drawing the attention of neighbours who rushed to the scene. “It was a terrible sight,” one neighbor recounted. “The circumstances did not look ordinary, and we immediately suspected foul play, but we couldn’t do anything.”

The family quickly notified the police, who arrived and evacuated Fatima’s body to Murtala Muhammad Specialist Hospital. At the hospital, medical personnel conducted examinations to determine if she had been sexually assaulted. Hospital sources confirmed to the family that Fatima was not raped but that her neck had been broken before she was hanged, deepening suspicions that her death was not self-inflicted. Her body was then released to the family for burial according to Islamic rites.

Speaking to Daily Trust, Fatima’s mother, who is also a secondary school principal in Kano, described her daughter as a patient, dutiful, and loving child who always respected her parents and lived peacefully with everyone. “I will always remember Fatima for her calmness, her kindness, and the way she loved us dearly,” she said in a sorrowful voice. “She was not only my daughter but also my companion and a trusted friend. This is a wound that may never heal.”

The spokesman for the Kano State Police Command, SP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, confirmed the incident and stated that investigations had already begun. “We received a distress call from the family and immediately deployed our men. The deceased was taken to the hospital where medical examinations were carried out. The command has opened a full-scale investigation to determine the actual cause of death and to ensure justice is served,” he assured.

The tragedy has sent shockwaves across Dandinshe Yamma Quarters, with residents struggling to come to terms with the loss. “Fatima was a cheerful and respectful girl. Everyone in the neighborhood loved her,” said Aminu Garba, a resident. “Her death has left us all devastated, and we want the truth to come out. That is why we implore the security agencies to do the needful.”

Community leaders and concerned citizens are now calling on security agencies to conduct a thorough, transparent, and speedy investigation. Many fear that failure to do so may embolden criminals and deepen public mistrust of law enforcement.

For the grieving family, the pain is personal and immeasurable. They pray for Allah to grant their daughter eternal rest in Aljannatul Firdaus and to expose those responsible for the tragedy. This type of incident is alien to the community, and a growing sense of fear and tension has gripped residents, who are demanding a serious investigation.",https://teentrust.ng/i-lost-a-companion-mother-of-hanged-daughter-narrates-ordeal/,https://dailytrust.com
Trent’s tribute after Real Madrid win,"Trent Alexander-Arnold says former Liverpool team-mate Diogo Jota “was there with me” after helping Real Madrid reach the Club World Cup semi-finals.

Alexander-Arnold and Jota spent five years together at Liverpool before the England full-back left for Madrid in June.

Jota, aged 28, died in a car crash on Thursday along with his 25-year-old brother Andre Silva. Their joint funeral was held on Saturday in Portugal.

Alexander-Arnold has been featuring for Real Madrid at the Club World Cup in the United States and assisted Fran Garcia’s goal in their 3-2 win against Borussia Dortmund in the quarter-final in New Jersey.

He said the news of Jota’s death had been “extremely difficult” to take in.

“I had to try to perform for the team and help them win the game, no matter how difficult it was,” Alexander-Arnold told DAZN after the game. ”As hard as it was to do it, I had to push myself to focus on what my job and role was. I tried to do it as best as I could, but it was difficult and I am not going to lie about that.

“[Jota] was one of my close friends – and I am sure that’s what he would have wanted me to do. I’m sure we would have had a laugh and joke about the assist as well. He was there with me, I am sure.”

Alexander-Arnold said the Portuguese forward was “someone who lit up the room when he was in it”.

“I shared the dressing room with him for five years – amazing memories on and off the pitch,” he added.

“It goes without saying he will never be forgotten by anyone. He will live long in all our memories for the amazing man and the player he was.”

Alexander-Arnold said it had been “very emotional and heartwarming to see the footballing world come together to show their love and support for [Jota], his brother and their family”.

“I’ve been around him, his brother, his family, his amazing wife, his amazing parents and his amazing children. It’s truly, truly heartbreaking to wake up to news like that,” added the England international.

“It’s something you never expect.”

Real Madrid’s Kylian Mbappe was among the players who paid tribute to Jota on Saturday, with the France forward indicating number 20 after scoring an acrobatic late goal, in recognition of Jota’s Liverpool shirt number.

Frenchman Ousmane Dembele also paid a tribute to the Portuguese by copying his Fifa gaming celebration after sealing a 2-0 win for Paris St-Germain against Bayern Munich, which set up a last-four meeting with Real Madrid.",https://teentrust.ng/jota-was-with-me-trents-tribute-after-real-madrid-win/,https://dailytrust.com
Norris takes first Silverstone win in dramatic race,"McLaren’s Lando Norris took his first home victory in a chaotic, dramatic, rain-affected British Grand Prix.

Norris benefited from a 10-second penalty handed to team-mate Oscar Piastri, who was found to have driven erratically during a restart after one of two safety-car periods at Silverstone.

Piastri had led the race calmly through a heavy shower of rain and series of incidents but was passed by Norris when he served his penalty at his final pit stop in the closing laps.

Norris appeared to be crying in his helmet on the slowing-down lap and described the win as “beautiful”. It reduces his deficit to Piastri in the drivers’ championship to eight points.

“Apart from a championship, I think this is as good as it gets in terms of feelings and in terms of achievement, being proud, all of it,” Norris said.

“The last few laps, I was just looking into the crowd. I was just trying to take it all in, enjoy the moment, because it might never happen again. I hope it does. But these are memories that I’ll bring with me forever.”

Nico Hulkenberg, 37, took his first podium finish at the 239th attempt – setting a new record for the longest time before finishing in the top three – after a strong race for Sauber.

The German managed to keep Lewis Hamilton’s Ferrari at bay in the closing laps as Red Bull’s Max Verstappen came home fifth.

Record crowd sees action-packed race

An all-time F1 record crowd – 168,000 on the day and 500,000 over the weekend – were treated to an action-packed race.

Perhaps the most extraordinary moment came when Verstappen spun before racing had resumed at the restart after the second safety-car period.

Verstappen appeared to have been distracted by what had happened a few seconds before in the incident that earned Piastri his penalty.

As Piastri prepared for the final restart on lap 22, he slowed on the Hangar Straight. Verstappen, partially unsighted in the wet conditions, briefly passed the Australian, and then complained over the radio that he had suddenly braked.

It carried echoes of an incident at the Canadian Grand Prix two races ago, when Red Bull protested against a similar action by race winner George Russell of Mercedes, but had it rejected.

This time, the stewards decided Piastri had contravened a regulation that demands drivers “proceed at a pace which involved no erratic braking nor any other manoeuvre which is likely to endanger other drivers from the point at which the lights on the safety car are turned off”.",https://teentrust.ng/norris-takes-first-silverstone-win-in-dramatic-race/,https://dailytrust.com
electronic line call fails at Wimbledon,"Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova said a game was ‘stolen’ from her when Wimbledon’s electronic line-calling system failed during her fourth-round match against Britain’s Sonay Kartal.

There was no ‘out’ call when a Kartal backhand went long at 4-4 in the first set, with chair umpire Nico Helwerth halting play.

Russian Pavlyuchenkova had seen the ball was out – and a TV replay showed that was the case by some distance.

Addressing the crowd, Helwerth said: “We’re just going to check if the system was up and running, because there was no audio call.”

After a telephone call, he announced the electronic system “was unfortunately unable to track the last point” and ordered the point to be replayed.

Umpires can decide to make their own call if the system breaks down and are also entitled to replay the point.

Had the ball been called out, Pavlyuchenkova would have won the point and taken the lead.

Instead, it was replayed, Kartal won the point and went on to break for a 5-4 lead.

The fact Pavlyuchenkova went on to win the match meant the malfunction was not as costly as it could have been, although she still questioned why the umpire did not call it out.

“That’s why he’s there,” she said. “He also saw it out, he told me after the match.

“I thought he would do that, but he didn’t. Instead they just said replay.

“I don’t know if it’s something to do [with Kartal being] local.

“I think it’s also difficult for him. He probably was scared to take such a big decision.” ‘You took the game away from me’

Pavlyuchenkova was clearly frustrated when she returned to her chair at the end of the game.

She told the umpire: “I don’t know if it’s in or out. How do I know? How can you prove it?

“You took the game away from me … They stole the game from me. They stole it.”

A spokesperson for the All England Club said: “Due to operator error the system was deactivated on the point in question.

“The chair umpire followed the established process.”

The automated line-calling system was introduced at Wimbledon for the first time this year.

Debbie Jevans – chair of the All England Club – said on Friday she was confident in its accuracy and the decision to bring it in. (BBCSport)",https://teentrust.ng/they-stole-the-game-electronic-line-call-fails-at-wimbledon/,https://dailytrust.com
but who could make World Cup?,"The triumphant England Under-21s were hidden by the tickertape as they lifted the Euro 2025 trophy. Now they must ensure they do not disappear again.

As the blue and white confetti rained down from the Slovakian sky the Young Lions were wrapped up in their celebrations.

They deserved to be. Jonathan Rowe’s extra-time goal sealed successive European titles after Germany had fought back from 2-0 down in Bratislava.

For many it was their last chance with the Under-21s, but, with a World Cup next summer, they have the opportunity to force their way into Thomas Tuchel’s plans.

Here, we assess who might progress to the full squad in time for next year’s World Cup, and what the progress of those who went before them might tell us.

Who are the standouts to make the World Cup? So, with a World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico less than 12 months away, who can make the step up?

Of the Euro 2023 winners, James Trafford, Levi Colwill, Cole Palmer, Morgan Gibbs-White, Noni Madueke and Curtis Jones were named in Tuchel’s squad for the games against Andorra and Senegal last month.

Will we see such a progression from the class of 25?

Newcastle full-back Tino Livramento is the obvious one to follow them after a good tournament and a fine season for the Magpies.

He has played on the right for England this summer but could fill the problematic left-back role for Tuchel.

Arsenal’s Myles Lewis-Skelly started in the 3-1 defeat by Senegal and Livramento – given his senior debut against the Republic of Ireland by Carsley last season – will be a standout option next summer should his form continue.

He returned to the Under-21s this summer after discussions with Tuchel and Carsley, with the pair eager for the 22-year-old to use his experience to help lead the group.

Harvey Elliott had the big moments in Slovakia to be named player of the tournament – the opening goal in the final, two match-winning strikes in the semi-final, scoring against Spain and England’s opening goal of the tournament against the Czech Republic.

Those big moments amplify his talent and only strengthen his and Liverpool’s hand.

The attacker could leave Anfield this summer in search of regular football, after only two Premier League starts in Liverpool’s title success, which should push him closer to senior recognition.

Anfield team-mate Jarell Quansah will be expecting more top-level minutes at Bayer Leverkusen, once his impending move from Liverpool is confirmed, after struggling for game time for the champions this season, and, at 33, Dan Burn’s England career will not go on forever.

Manchester City’s James McAtee captained the U21s and excelled. But, like Elliott and Quansah, his future is uncertain with reports he could leave Etihad Stadium this summer.

This highlights one of the conundrums facing the Premier League’s academy products. Selling them on has become highly lucrative for clubs’ balance sheets, as they go down as pure profit in the accounts because little or no transfer fee was paid for them in the first place.

Will this affect their development, or will moves allow them to thrive like Palmer when he left Manchester City for Chelsea?

Who else could be in the reckoning?

Centre-back Charlie Cresswell impressed in Slovakia. The Toulouse defender was man of the match in the quarter-final win over Spain in Trnava.

It follows a debut season in France during which the former Leeds centre-back was linked with Serie A side Como.

Cresswell, son of former Preston and Sheffield United striker Richard, played 33 times as Toulouse finished 10th in Ligue 1 following last summer’s move from Elland Road, having made only six starts for his boyhood club.

Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, who has also played for Scotland Under-21s, was a machine in Slovakia having impressed at the City Ground.

The dynamic and combative 22-year-old is now too old for the Young Lions and a repeat of his first season at Forest will make him hard to ignore.

Much is also expected of Arsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri, although, at 18, he is the youngest in the group.

The attacker started against Slovenia and Germany in the group stage – off the back of 37 appearances for the Gunners last season – but has time to develop.

There are plenty of others to consider as well, with several missing from Carsley’s squad.",https://teentrust.ng/european-u21-champions-again-but-who-could-make-world-cup/,https://dailytrust.com
Calvert-Lewin to leave Everton as free agent,"Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin says he has made the “incredibly difficult decision” to leave the club.

The 28-year-old England international’s contract will expire on Monday.

Calvert-Lewin joined Everton from Sheffield United for £1.5m in 2016 and has scored 71 goals in 273 games for the Toffees.

“After nine remarkable years I’ve made the incredibly difficult decision – together with my family – to begin a new chapter in my career,” Calvert-Lewin posted on Instagram. ”This isn’t something I chose lightly. Everton has been my home since I was 19 years old. It’s the place that saw potential in me, challenged me to grow and shaped me both as a footballer and as a man.

“I want to express my gratitude to all the managers and coaches I’ve worked with over the years and to my team-mates who have become life-long friends.”

Calvert-Lewin enjoyed his best season in 2020-21 when he scored 16 goals in 33 Premier League games and was part of the England squad that reached the Euros final that summer.

When Love Hurts: Understanding toxic parenting,"By Asma’u Yusuf

Hey fam,

Good intentions can sometimes go wrong.

Let’s talk about something a little uncomfortable—but real: toxic parenting.

Now, wait—before you roll your eyes or shout, “That’s why I don’t like this house!”—breathe.

This isn’t about blaming or dragging your parents through the mud. It’s about understanding what happens when love starts to feel like pressure… or fear… or silence.

Because let’s be honest: Some of us are being raised in homes that hurt more than they heal. And the confusing part? Sometimes, the people hurting us think they’re helping.

What is toxic parenting anyway?

It’s not just when your mum yells at you or your dad says “Because I said so.”

Toxic parenting is a pattern where:

Your confidence is constantly chipped away

Your emotions are ignored or dismissed

You’re controlled instead of guided

You feel like love has to be earned—not freely given

And here’s the kicker: you might not even realise it, because it’s just… normal at your house.

Some signs you might recognise

You’re always walking on eggshells

You can’t just be. You’re constantly adjusting your voice, words, or face to avoid upsetting someone.

“Why are you frowning?” “I don’t like your tone.”

Sometimes you wonder if silence is your safest outfit.

Your feelings are dismissed.

“Stop crying.”

“You’re too sensitive.”

“When I was your age, I already had a job.”

Instead of being heard, you feel judged.

You’re controlled, not supported

Maybe your phone gets searched with zero trust.

Maybe every outfit or friendship becomes a family debate.

You’re growing—but not being allowed to own your voice.

Guilt trips & emotional blackmail

“After everything I’ve done for you…”

“You’re going to break this family.”

Yikes. That’s not love—it’s manipulation wrapped in sacrifice.

Comparisons That Cut Deep

“Your sister doesn’t give me this headache.”

“See how other children behave?”

It’s the kind of love that makes you feel like you’ll never be enough.

But wait—let’s keep it real about parents too

Let’s not turn this into a parent roast session. Many parents are doing their best with:

Unhealed trauma

Zero emotional education

Cultures that equate fear with respect

Add in real fear for their children (especially in today’s crazy world), and sometimes control and overprotection come from panic, not hatred.

“I’m hard on you because I’m scared for you.”

Is that okay? Not always.

Is it understandable? Sometimes, yes.

It’s complicated. But knowing their fear doesn’t mean you excuse the hurt. It just helps you understand why love sometimes comes out as control.

And remember…

Your parents do love you—even if they don’t always know how to show it.

They’re often the first people in your corner and would give you the world if they could.

So… try cutting them a little slack sometimes.

Try seeing things from their point of view—especially when it feels like they just “don’t get it.”

And remember: you’re at that phase where everything feels like “Nobody understands me” or “I’m being judged.”

It’s normal. And this too shall pass.

Hey, we all went through it—and we turned out fine.

(Well… almost fine.)

What you can do (without starting World War 3 at home)

Know it’s not your fault

You didn’t cause this. You’re not “too much.” You’re not “ungrateful.”

Your feelings are real.

Find safe adults

An aunt, a mentor, a teacher or a neighbor

Sometimes healing starts with someone who listens without trying to fix you.

Try dialogue when it’s safe

Say:

“I know you’re worried about me, but I feel suffocated.”

“Can we talk about a better way to handle things when I mess up?”

“I want to do better too. Let’s figure this out.”

Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn’t. But speaking up plants a seed.

Dialogue is ideal—but safety comes first.

If you live in a home where speaking up leads to shouting, punishment, or fear—it’s okay to stay quiet and protect your peace.

Just know you’re not crazy for wanting better.

Reassure when you can

If your parents are anxious or paranoid, a little reassurance can soften the air.

Try:

“I’m not hiding anything. I promise to come to you if I’m in trouble.”

“You raised me well. Let me try and make mistakes too.”

You’re not parenting your parents—but sometimes showing maturity invites more trust.

Build Your Own Peace

Write. Pray. Dance. Journal.

Create safe places in your mind when your home isn’t one.

Final Words: You deserve love that feels like love

Not survival.

Not fear.

Not walking on eggshells just to be “accepted.”

You’re not ungrateful. You’re not difficult. You’re not too much.

You’re just human. And worthy.

And yes—you can grow up in pain and still create a home of peace later.

That’s the real flex.

This Week’s Journal Prompts:

What are 3 things I wish the adults in my life understood about me?

What would a safe home look and feel like for me?

How do I want to parent differently in future?

Tips on how to become a model,"Modelling is one glamorous and lucrative profession desired by many. It is extremely competitive. Successful models spend their time doing something they love.

Knowing what to expect when entering the world of modelling can help prepare you to become a model.

Be healthy inside

Eat and drink healthy foods and get plenty of exercise. Having a healthy body will help you look your best.

Maintain your appearance

Take care to make yourself look healthy and well-groomed. What you wear and how you carry yourself are important as well, but you should have a routine that supports the health of your skin and hair.

Focus on keeping your skin clear and glowing, as well as keeping your hair shiny and healthy if you are female.

Match your modelling goals to your body type

Technically, anybody can be a model. However, if you don’t meet certain requirements, the work available to you will be limited.

A plus-sized model: If your body is full and curvaceous, you may be able to be a plus-sized model.

A runway model: Most women on the catwalk are at least 5’8. Men are mostly between 5’11 and 6’2.

Consider situational modeling

If you do not think the runway or magazines are the place for you, look into other types of modelling. Companies use models for special events or to promote specific products. There are fewer restrictions on body type and more emphasis on personality for these modelling jobs.

Educate yourself about the industry

Learn as much as you can from reading books, blogs and articles about modelling. Reading quality guides, articles, and books will help you improve important skills (like posing and posture) and better understand how the industry works.

Be prepared for a difficult road

The modelling world is jam-packed with pretty faces. Being good looking does not equate to success as a model. The modelling business is not just about looking great; you have to fit the need of specific jobs, just in order to get a chance.

Do not be shy

You will have to promote yourself and look for opportunities to step up and prove your abilities. Be yourself, let your personality shine, and have a confident attitude.

Visit a modelling agency

Almost every major city has multiple modelling agencies, and almost every agency has “open-calls” where they look for new talents.

Be professional, polite and courteous

Remember that, although you are not working in an office, you need to be professional. Treat the people you work with respectfully. Never look down on anyone. You may be a model, but that doesn’t give you the right to be snooty, affected, or pompous.

Be creative on the job

Photographers want to see you pose with different props and backdrop. Changeability is key, so work for the camera and interact with the world around you.

The Njiri Attire of Ijaw People,"Ijaw People of Nigeria are mostly found in riverine areas of Niger-Delta. They are found in Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Cross River, and some parts of Ondo State.

The Ijaws currently numbering about 15 million have long lived in locations near many sea trade routes, and were well connected to other areas by trade as early as the 15th century. Ijaw people sit on Nigeria`s rich oil lands.

They are believed to originate from Oru people who were the earliest settlers in Southern Nigeria and they are often involved in fishing and trading.

Just like other tribes, Ijaw people prefer their own Nigerian native wears. Still, the influence of European, African, and other fashion trends make them choose fashion in Nigerian traditional styles and often select ‘modern looks’ instead of deeply traditional attires.

The Ijaw people are one of the numerous groups of people in Nigeria which stand out in their dressing and elegance.

The Ijaw have their shirts in three major styles, the etibo, owoko and jumper. …

However, the dressing of the Ijaw people is never complete without the ‘Njiri‘ attire; a clothing material which makes up part of the people’s elegance.

It is also referred to as ‘George material’ in English. Along with other accessories such as coral beads, hats, and walking sticks, an Ijaw person is just as stylish as you need them to be.

This particular attire is called other names in different parts of Ijaw land which includes ‘akara‘, ‘ashitee’, and so on.

‘Njiri’ is worn ceremonially in weddings, traditional festivals, chieftaincy events, and so among the people. This particular attire is also worn by other people in the Southern part of Nigeria.

The ‘George material’ is available in Nigerian markets and can be sewn into different fabulous styles to look dashing and unique in ceremonies.",https://teentrust.ng/the-njiri-attire-of-ijaw-people/,https://dailytrust.com

What to know about emergence of Emir in North,"In Northern Nigeria, emirs, traditionally the rulers of emirates, have historically emerged through a combination of dynastic succession, religious influence, and sometimes, through military conquest. The British colonial administration also played a significant role in shaping their emergence and authority.

In the North, emirates are generally led by Emirs, who are traditional rulers with significant political and cultural influence. While the system has been constitutionally nominal since the first republic, Emirs continue to hold considerable authority and influence.

The emergence of Emirs varies depending on the specific emirate, but generally involves a combination of hereditary succession, consultation with key figures, and the approval of the state government.

The emirate system of administration can be likened to a constitutional monarchy. The governments of the emirates were completely centralized. The Emirs controlled the Executive Legislative and Judicial powers of the emirates. The Emirs who were the political, administrative and spiritual leaders appointed a number of officials assigned with specific duties.

The Sultan of Sokoto is considered the leader of the Qadiriyya sufi order in Nigeria, and the position of Emir of Kano is the second most important Muslim position after the Sultan.

The emirate system of administration in Northern Nigeria is often compared to a constitutional monarchy, with the Emir as the head of both the executive and judicial branches. While the system has been adapted to the modern Nigerian context, the Emirs retain a significant level of influence and are seen as important figures in the political and social landscape

Here’s a more detailed breakdown:

Hereditary succession:

In many emirates, the position of Emir is passed down within a family line.

Consultation with key figures:

When an Emir dies or is removed, a process of consultation with prominent members of the community, including the Emirate Council, is typically undertaken to identify and propose a successor.

State Government Approval:

The final selection of an Emir often requires the approval of the state government. This can involve interviews, presentations, and assessments of the candidate’s qualifications.",https://teentrust.ng/what-to-know-about-emergence-of-emir-in-north/,https://dailytrust.com
Tips on how to become laboratory scientist,"Clinical laboratory scientists (CLS) are the detectives of the medical field.

Know what type of post-high school education is required.

Clinical laboratory scientists usually have a bachelor’s degree with a major in medical technology or in one of the life sciences; clinical laboratory technicians generally need either an associate degree or a certificate.

Lab scientists have a more extensive knowledge of molecular biology and microbiology techniques.

Consider various schools

Gather information on universities that have programs specific to training clinical lab scientists.

Degrees from schools with these accreditations are nationally recognized and will make you more competitive as a job candidate.

Take the proper chemistry, biology, and physics coursework.

Being a CLS requires that you learn the proper subjects before entering the workforce: biology, immunology, hematology, chemistry (organic, physical, and analytical), biochemistry, and physics (light and electricity).

These courses represent the core type of work you will be doing on a daily basis. If you find these classes don’t interest you, consider a different career path or speak to a counselor about other options.

Starting Your Career

Look for jobs in the medical field.

Hospitals are the leading employers, but clinical laboratory technologists are also employed by independent laboratories, physicians’ offices and clinics, and manufacturers of lab equipment and diagnostic supplies.

Learn about the various job duties of clinical lab scientists.

Some of the many duties that fall under the job description are:

Examine body fluids and tissues for parasites, bacteria, and other organisms.

Analyze chemical content and reactions necessary for finding out cholesterol levels and matching blood for transfusions.

Measure types and levels of drugs in the system for treatment or to assess response to treatment.

Become trained in using various laboratory equipment

Microscopes, cell counters and computerized equipment are all used by clinical laboratory scientists. In the process of obtaining your degree, you will be trained on these devices. Volunteer in a lab for additional experience and to decide if this is the right career for you.

What you should know about Masquerades Festivals in South East,"Igboland holds many festivities and cultural performances, most notably the masquerades and the new Yam festivals.

The traditional calendar in Igboland is based on the lunar calendar. It comprises four market days (Eke, Orie, Afo and Nkwo) with seven weeks per month.

Masquerades (Mmanwu) are held in accordance with the community native calendars during festivals, annual festivities, burial rites and other social gatherings.

The masquerades are geared in colourful robes and masks made of wood or fabric. Some masks appear only at one festival, but the majority appears at many or all.

Masquerades are associated with spiritual elements, as according to Igbo belief, they represent images of deities or sometimes even dead relatives. The identity of the masquerade is a well-kept secret and performed exclusively by men.

In the past, masquerades were regarded as the means for maintaining peace and order and were primarily used as law enforcement agents. The whole village would come out for the ceremony of the colourful masquerades. While entertaining through dances and exhibiting extra-human feats, the masquerades would walk up to certain individuals and loudly expose any bad habits, crimes or misbehaviour of that person. As people would always take corrections from these exposures, the masquerades were effective in keeping up with traditional norms and values in the communities.

With colonisation in the 20th century, masquerades became more relevant as an institution for cultural entertainment. Nowadays, they are used more for tourist attractions when they come out in colourful robes accompanied by traditional dancers and music.

The masks are determined by local tradition and beliefs. Best-known are those that represent the spirit of deceased maidens and their mothers symbolising beauty and peacefulness. This masquerade may be accompanied by the elephant spirit, representing ugliness and aggression, which frightens the male spectators away from her beauty. Other characters include the European (Mbeke), a pair of boy and girl (Mba), the boy dressed up as a girl satirising his counterpart, and animals (crocodile, snake etc.) representing various local deities.",https://teentrust.ng/what-you-should-know-about-masquerades-festivals-in-south-east/,https://dailytrust.com

Dangers of keeping bad company in school,"By Bolaji Mbang

A bad company is an association or group of ill-mannered people. Bad company is rampant among teens and youth. In our society today, most youths have been misled by bad friends. These uncultured individuals may be products of a bad upbringing or a failed society. Bad company, they say, corrupts good manners. It is pertinent, therefore, to discuss the dangers of keeping bad company in school.

Bad company leads one to numerous social vices ranging from kidnapping, cultism, substance abuse, and many others which disturb the peace of citizens, and the society at large. Students who fall victim to these vices face a lot of challenges in their academics and also face some problems in the outside world.

Furthermore, bad company drags students and pupils back, academically. It hinders them from performing or reaching their optimum potential. It destroys the bright future of teens and in the long run, the future of our nation; because the students who are supposed to study hard and get good grades and also make an impact in society are terrorising the peace of other citizens, sitting behind bars and engaging in all kinds of illicit behaviour.

Aside from backwardness in academics, and becoming a nuisance to society, the bad company also wastes the blood, sweat, and resources a parent has put into a child. This shatters the dreams a parent has concerning his or her children thus bringing shame and disappointment to the parents and family.

In conclusion, bad company corrupts good manners, and we should all try our best to make ourselves, teachers, and parents proud by keeping clear of bad company and also try to make our society better because we are “The Future of this Great Nation.”

Effects of cultism on our society,"By Fatima TIjani, SS1

Cultism is the operation of a secret cult. It is the involvement in cult activities. Today, there are many secret cult groups in Nigeria, especially in tertiary institutions. Cultism has become a grave national issue. It has made campus life unbearable for those who ordinarily would love to go about their affairs peacefully and reasonably.

Cultism promotes violence because virtually all groups are violent. The different groups attack one another with various weapons in order to gain supremacy. Apart from violence, cult members are potential murderers because they kill members of rival groups and even innocent people.

There are occasions on which they shoot one another; even in examination halls. Cultism causes the breakdown of law and order as members disregard their school rules and enact theirs, which are at variance with the standards of the school.

Students join cultism for some reasons, which include family background, economic hardship, curiosity, lack of self-confidence, peer pressure, insecurity, exposure to violence and crime-related forms, unemployment and support from school staff etc.

Lastly, cultism can be prevented in so many ways. In the first place, parents should pay attention to their children’s upbringing and educate them properly on acceptable standards of behaviour. Students should also be encouraged to join religious groups and develop a fear of God because the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. Educational institutions and the government should enact very strict laws against cultism.

Sustainability terms you need to know,"If you’re trying to find your footing and do your part when it comes to preserving our planet, it may be a little overwhelming at first to get all of the terminologies down. Leading a sustainable lifestyle doesn’t have to be super intimidating or overly complicated, though.

While words like “biodegradable” and “carbon footprint” are constantly being thrown around in discussions surrounding the environment, you may not know what exactly it all means.

Here are sustainability terms and meaning, plus, when and how they play into your day-to-day lives.

Carbon Footprint

A carbon footprint is a term used to describe the number of greenhouse gases, specifically carbon dioxide, to support human activity like driving a car or using electricity.

“When we breathe, we release carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas. This is essential for our survival, so although this activity releases a greenhouse gas, it is unavoidable,” says Dr. Kuppuswamy, who explains that other types of consumption like driving cars are not as essential.

“Driving a car requires the consumption of petrol or diesel, when this liquid burns, it releases greenhouse gases. This is counted as part of each person’s carbon footprint. So, the sum total of all the activities that one does, which lead to the release of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, is known as the carbon footprint.”

There are a number of resources available to help you calculate your personal carbon footprint. Most times, your footprint is divided into at least three categories: home energy, transportation, and waste.

The Environmental Protection Agency offers an accurate carbon footprint calculator through a spreadsheet while sites like Footprint Calculator offer a more visual and interactive experience

Sustainable

This is probably the most recognized and important word on this list.

To be sustainable means you prioritize the use of natural and renewable resources rather than contributing excess amounts of waste from things like coal, gas, and oil that can impact future generations.

Per the United Nations, renewable resources that help our environment include:

Solar energy: converts light into electricity with panels facing the sun.

Wind energy: creates energy from moving air using large wind turbines.

Geothermal energy: uses heat from Earth’s interior as an energy source

Hydropower: uses water from reservoirs and rivers to provide drinking water, hydrate plant crops, control floods and droughts, help with navigation, and create energy by being pumped into a generator through a pipe.

Ocean energy: waves and currents that produce electricity or heat

Bio-energy: uses wood, charcoal, and dung to produce heat, power, and agricultural crops.",https://teentrust.ng/sustainability-terms-you-need-to-know-2/,https://dailytrust.com
How to care for Dry hair,"Experts said sometimes, the type of skin you have affects your hair type. If you have dry skin you probably have dry hair and the same goes for oily skin and oily hair.

There are many products in the market that can help you take care of your hair irrespective of the type of hair you have.

Tips to care for Dry Hair

Dry hair looks weak and feels “crunchy” to the touch. There are many causes of dry hair, ranging from genetics (if mom and dad have dry hair, you probably will, too) to hair treatments.

Inactive oil glands can cause dry hair. If you have dry hair because of dry skin, consider washing your hair fewer times each week (every two or three days).

Pay attention to the type of shampoo and conditioner you use to make sure it replenishes your scalp with essential oils.

Use hair care product whose labels contains words like “hydrating” and “moisturizing.”

Be sure to take care with heat and chemicals on dry hair.

Electric hair straighteners (flat irons) and curling irons can cause serious damage to hair. When used on high heat, hair dryers can damage hair, too. Reducing the use of these hot devices will help keep your hair healthier.

However be careful on the appliance you use on your hair, if you are not sure of an appliance, don’t use it.",https://teentrust.ng/how-to-care-for-dry-hair-2/,https://dailytrust.com
Why you must avoid germs,"Germs are tiny organisms that can cause disease. They are so small that they can creep into your system without you noticing. To stay healthy, it helps to give some thought to germs.

The term germS is really just a generic word for four different types of organisms: bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa.

Bacteria are tiny, single-celled organisms that are found throughout nature, including in the bodies of human beings. But bacteria can cause trouble, ever had a urinary tract infection or strep throat? These infections are caused by bacteria.

Viruses are even smaller than bacteria and can’t live on their own. In order to survive, grow, and reproduce, they need to be inside other living organisms. Most viruses can only live for a very short time outside other living cells. Viruses are responsible for not-so-serious diseases like colds as well as extremely serious diseases like smallpox.

Fungi (pronounced: FUN-guy) are multi-celled, plant-like organisms that usually aren’t dangerous in a healthy person. Fungi can’t produce their own food from soil, water, and air, so instead, they get nutrition from plants, food, and animals in damp, warm environments.

Protozoa (pronounced: pro-toe-ZO-uh) are one-celled organisms like bacteria. Protozoa love moisture, so intestinal infections and other diseases they cause are often spread through contaminated water.

Once organisms like bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa invade your body, they get ready to stay for a while. These germs draw all their energy from you. They may damage or destroy some of your own healthy cells.

As they use up your nutrients and energy, most will produce waste products, known as toxins.

Some toxins cause the annoying symptoms of common colds or flu-like infections, such as sniffles, sneezing, coughing, and diarrhea. But other toxins can cause high fever, increased heart rate, and even life-threatening illness.

How can you protect yourself from Germs?

The best way to prevent the infections that germs cause is by protecting yourself. Most germs are spread through the air in sneezes or coughs or through bodily fluids like saliva, semen, vaginal fluid, or blood.

If you or someone else is sick, your best bet is to limit contact with those substances.

Washing your hands often is absolutely the best way to stop germs from getting into your body.

When should you wash?

After using the bathroom, after blowing your nose or coughing, after touching any pets or animals, after gardening, or before and after visiting a sick relative or friend. And of course you should wash your hands before eating or cooking.

There’s a right way to wash hands, too, you need to soap up well using warm water and plenty of soap, then rub your hands vigorously together for 20 seconds (away from the water).

Rinse your hands and finish by drying them thoroughly on a clean towel. It’s a good idea to carry hand sanitizer.

Another way to fight infections from germs is to make sure you have the right immunizations, especially if you’ll be traveling to other countries. Getting a flu vaccination yearly is strongly recommended, unless your doctor tells you otherwise.

With a little prevention, you can keep harmful germs out of your way!",https://teentrust.ng/why-you-must-avoid-germs-2/,https://dailytrust.com

UTME: How I Emerged As Gombe’s Top JAMB Scorer — Aisha Girei,"Aisha Ahmed Girei is a 16-year-old student of Pen Resource Academy Gombe. She is arguably the top scorer from Gombe State in this year’s Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) results recently released by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB). In this interview, the SS3 student spoke on the secret behind her success despite mass failure recorded in the exams nationwide and her future plans.

By Haruna Gimba Yaya, Gombe

Tell us a bit about yourself

My name is Aisha Ahmed Girei. I am 16 years old, a student of Pen Resource Academy Gombe and an indigene of Adamawa State, but living in Gombe. I attended Pen Resource Academy Gombe for my nursery, primary, as well as secondary school education.

You scored 333 in your UTME. How were you able to achieve this feat despite the massive failure recorded this year?

Actually, the school started to prepare us for the JAMB examination immediately after we entered SS3 in September 2024. Initially, I didn’t take it seriously because I thought that the exam was still very far away. It was around January or February this year that I became serious because I realised that the UTME was indeed very close. And from that time, I sat up and studied hard. I created a timetable and planned a routine for studying both at home and at school. Though I did not start early, I used the little time I had wisely and I think it was what made the difference.

Did you set a target point that you wanted to achieve?

Well, I didn’t particularly aim to score 333 points, but I had a very high target because the course I want to study is very competitive. And Gombe State University, where I applied, pegged 200 as its cut-off point, so my aim was to score at least 300 or 320 points to stand a chance.

Were you pressured by your father to study medicine?

Not actually; though my father is a medical doctor, he neither asked me nor put pressure on me to study medicine and surgery. I was just inspired by the way he is helping people with his profession. And from when I was a child, I developed an interest and wanted to also become a medical doctor and help people.

Aside from medicine, which other course do you think you can study?

I can study software engineering; it is another area I have interest in and I believe I can do very well.

What is your reading pattern like?

In my school, the SS3 students report to school by 7am and close by 5.30pm. When I get back home, I study for like two hours and sleep by 10pm. I wake up around 2am or 3am and study till dawn. I also study during any free time I find and in any environment that I know I can comprehend. So, basically, I study round the clock. But I mostly read during the night, from like 3am to 7am.

Are you saying you shunned all forms of social life, like watching television and using smartphones?

Yes, I cut off totally from social media and also greatly minimised my television time, as well as other stuff that would consume time and distract me from studying.

What role did your parents play in your success?

My parents are my biggest inspiration, especially my dad, who always advises and encourages me, telling me that I could do it. My mum also helps by putting me through; she guides me and always ensures that I am consistent with my studies.

How do you feel that your efforts have paid off?

Alhamdulillah! I feel grateful that all my hard work, efforts and sacrifices of secluding myself from all social life and enjoyment were not in vain. I am very happy that all the efforts I have put into studying have finally paid off.

Were you always ahead in your class, or were you just an average student?

I used to top the class but not all the time, though most of the time I was on top. Nevertheless, I never allowed that to deceive me. I have always tried to improve on my previous feats and aim for more success.

Apart from studying Medicine & Surgery, what are your other plans?

I want to venture into entrepreneurship, running small businesses like catering in order to be self-reliant. Though there are high demands for medical doctors, I believe that in this age, one should not rely too much on one source of income or white-collar job. Even though I know that studying medicine and surgery is very demanding, I still want to learn catering in my spare time.

How many hours did you read daily?

It depends on the day and my schedules, but on average I studied for about six hours daily, or more than that if I have a lot to cover. However, sometimes it was less if I am very tired. What mattered to me most was consistency and understanding what I was reading.

What do you do in your free time?

I enjoy spending time with my family, it helps me relax, especially after spending much time reading and I also like watching educational videos, it also helps me to learn new things and sometimes I just like lying down quietly to rest, it enables me to recharge.

What advice would you give to other students?

My advice to fellow students is to believe in themselves. They should stay focused and don’t wait until it is too late to start preparing for the examination. They should use their time wisely and ask questions when they don’t understand what they were taught or are being taught. Above all, they should put their trust in Allah and pray hard. They should also be consistent with reading, because a small effort done every day makes a difference.",https://teentrust.ng/utme-how-i-emerged-as-gombes-top-jamb-scorer-aisha-girei/,https://dailytrust.com
"I failed UTME five times, says best graduating student","The best graduating student of Abiola Ajimobi Technical University, Ibadan, Uthman Uthman Olayode, revealed that he failed the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examinations (UTME) five times before he was offered scholarship to study at the university.

Olayode disclosed this during the combined convocation ceremony for the 2022/2023 and 2023/2024 academic sessions of the university.

The event was attended by eminent personalities, including Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State who was represented by the Deputy Governor, Adebayo Lawal; the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Akinloye Owolabi Olakulehin who was represented by Aree Egbe Omo Balogun of Ibadanland, Chief Adegboyega Adegoke; the Chancellor of the institution, Dr Tunde Afolabi; the Chairman of the Governing Council, Dr. Kazeem Adesola Adeduntan and the Vice Chancellor of the institution, Professor Adesola Ajayi.

Addressing the gathering, the best student said that no dream is too big to become a reality, and no background is too humble to be liberated by solid education.

Olayode recounted that he faced repeated setbacks in gaining admission to a higher institution and had to sit for the UTME five times, with each attempt full of promise, and each denial a heavy blow.

He added that despite the challenges, he earned 55 As and only 2 Bs throughout his university years.

He said: “I am, therefore, a living proof that no dream is too big to become a reality, and no background is too humble to be liberated by solid education.”

“I feel proud to say that my name is Uthman Uthman Olayode, and I am deeply honoured to address you as the overall best graduating student of the 2023/2024 academic session of Abiola Ajimobi Technical University.”

“Despite excelling in secondary school, I faced repeated setbacks in gaining admission to a higher institution and had to sit for the UTME five times, with each attempt full of promise, and each denial a heavy blow. I watched classmates gain admission while I remained behind, wondering if my turn would ever come. But faith kept me going.”

” And when it was time, God showed me that delays are not denials. On my fifth attempt, I was awarded a scholarship to this esteemed institution to study Physics with Electronics, a course known for its rigour and tough demand.

“Reflecting on my journey, I am reminded that what seems like a delay to us is often the perfect timing in God’s divine plan. Despite the challenges, I persevered, earning 55 As and only 2 Bs throughout my university years. You will give me the privilege to declare that, remarkably, I achieved a perfect 5.0 GPA in six out of eight semesters, five of which were consecutive.

” Additionally, I was honoured to receive three prestigious scholarships: the Federal Government Scholarship Award (FSB) in both my 300 and 400 levels, MTN Foundation Scholarship, and Oyo State bursary for final year students.

“Beyond academics, I had the privilege of serving as the Ameer of the Muslim Students’ Society of Nigeria (MSSN), Abiola Ajimobi Technical University chapter, in my final year.

“Despite the numerous challenges and stress that came with leadership, including late-night meetings and travels, I was able to maintain an excellent academic record throughout my tenure. This experience has taught me that serving a higher purpose and sacrificing for a noble cause does not hinder one’s progress, but it rather propels it forward.”

From rejection to 4.93 CGPA: LASU’s best graduating student tells her story,"Miss Isioma Nwosu, the overall best student of Lagos State University for the 2023/2024 academic session, says she thought she had failed in life when she could not secure admission to study medicine and surgery.

Nwosu, who graduated with a cumulative grade point average of 4.93 from the Department of Biochemistry, made this known in her valedictory speech at the 28th convocation ceremony of LASU.

LASU awarded diplomas, degrees, and certificates at the event, which took place on its main campus in Ojo.

Nwosu said that she had never heard of biochemistry until LASU offered her admission to the course.

“In 2019, after graduating as the valedictorian of my secondary school, I faced a setback and had to rewrite UTME.”

“A valedictorian writing UTME again? It was a bitter pill to swallow. My dream was to study medicine and surgery at the University of Ibadan. I fell just two points below the cut-off mark. The news of my repeat spread like a wildfire in my secondary school. I thought I had failed in life,” she said.

Nwosu said that she equally applied for medicine and surgery at LASU but was offered biochemistry.

“This time, I made LASU my first choice and, again, aiming for medicine and surgery.

“However, I was offered biochemistry, a course I had never heard of.

“My heart broke the second time,” she said.

She said that she could not embrace the course in her first year.

She said that some of her lecturers and friends, however, encouraged her to put in her best.

Nwosu advised students to study hard and be confident.

She also advised her fellow graduates to believe in themselves regardless of their grades.

“You completed this phase. You are resilient, capable and prepared for the future. The world is waiting for your greatness and manifestation.

“To everyone listening, never be afraid of having big dreams, your dreams are the seeds of greatness.

“Additionally, surround yourself with friends with values and equal visions and ambitions,” she said.

“The ultimate goal is to use your knowledge and skill to drive meaningful change wherever you find yourselves,” she told the graduating students.

"As much as you study, trying to get all As, don’t let it define you — Habiba, AUN valedictorian to undergraduates","Habiba Amani Abdullahi is the best graduating student of the class of 2025 at the American University of Nigeria, Yola, with a major is Natural Environmental Science with a concentration in Biomedical Sciences. In this interview, she spoke on how she overcame her mental health challenge and emerged the valedictorian and more.

By Chidimma C. Okeke

I’m here at the University of Victoria, of course it’s interesting.

What does it mean to be part of the AUN Honour Society, and what qualifies you for that?

The qualification for it is just attaining the highest CGPA in the whole class.

I have had high CGP, I think the years is the cumulative average, so at the end, the person with the highest grade is the person who emerges as valedictorian.

When you came in as a freshman, did you have a dream or plan to emerge as a valedictorian?

Not really, because I came here as a transfer student, so I was just, honestly, trying to get through school. I didn’t want to stress myself; I just tried to get through school. But today I met at the University of Victoria.

What do you think you did that is different from what you think others are not doing?

I would say I just started believing in myself more, because I used to doubt myself very often. And since I came here, I built my confidence more and started believing in myself. As I was saying that the things I thought were unattainable were actually very doable once I set my mind to them.

Was it a place of lecturers in helping you to achieve the feat today?

Definitely, my faculty has helped me very well, especially my lecturers like Dr Malakey and Dr Haji; they’ve influenced me, they’ve pushed me and they also inspired me so much to do research and just studying.

What are those things within the four years that you think were major challenges for you while studying?

I’ve struggled a lot with self-confidence and believing in myself. It’s also known as impostor syndrome nowadays, so when you think you can’t achieve things, but in reality, you can. And also, things like challenges at home, and because I was also an off-campus student, so not being in the campus, like on campus in school was also a challenge for me, because having to struggle at home and then come in here every day, it was a challenge for me. But I was able to overcome all of that.

Why didn’t you choose to do that on campus?

It was because when I was transferring here, I left my old school because I was struggling with mental health, so I wanted to be close to home, which was the reason I even transferred to AUN.

What burden does this place on you as an individual?

I don’t think it has brought me any burden, because for the past few years of my life, I’ve always kind of used other people’s opinions to determine my value. So other people’s opinions on me, or their own expectations, I’m not going to let it limit me or put me in a box.

What’s your dream beyond here?

After coming here, I plan to pursue graduate studies in biotechnology, and I have recently been accepted into an Ivy League University in the US. So, I plan to continue there and become a biomedical scientist in the future.

You’ve said you’ve been transferred here for some reasons, and you’ve excelled here too. Are there certain structures or initiatives that this school has that you think helped you?

Yes, I would say the faculty-to-students’ ratio, for example, in school, is way better than it was in my last school. So being able to talk to faculty whenever you have a problem, and then being able to address it as quickly as possible, compared to my former school. And just for my faculty, they just want to see the best in you and the best professors I’ve ever met. They played a role in my success.

What academic challenges did you experience over here?

Well, here, I did experience a challenge in my senior research project, which I was supposed to complete in a year but actually took me two years to complete because of certain challenges with the lab infrastructure. It is not about here at AUN but in Nigeria in general. I had to send samples from the lab outside the country for analysis before I was able to get the results, and that took a long time and it delayed my project.

What was your most cherished moment in school?

I don’t think it’s any big moment. It’s usually the small moment when I’m just hanging out with the friends I’ve made here, just hanging out in the dorm and laughing and talking, not necessarily anything.

If you are to meet someone in their first year, what are those things that you think you would want to say to them that would be very helpful?

I would tell them to just relax and breathe, because sometimes there are external pressures, and you shouldn’t let them get to you, because they’ll affect you academically, mentally, physically, in so many ways. So, as much as you try to study, and try to get all the As, and all that, don’t let it define you. So, I also try to balance your social life.

In what extracurricular activities were you involved in school?

Well, I was here as part of the Honors Society, where I did two, like my first three semesters. I enjoyed tutoring students on organic chemistry, most especially, because it was my favorite course. And at the end of the semester, when the students come and tell me also, like, I got an A minor, I got an A plus, you just feel that sense of fulfillment.

And just like, you feel accomplished. And it’s highly rewarding. Also, at the Honors Society, I was the event coordinator and working towards advancing STEM education for African women, where we go to government secondary schools here in Yola, and just promote STEM education to young girls. Because, you know, lots of girls are told, like, this STEM field is a male-dominated field, so you don’t belong here. I am just telling them that they also have a place here and shouldn’t get discouraged.

Finally, what role do you think your parents played that helped in your feat today?

Oh, my parents played the biggest role because they did support me financially and emotionally.

I can tell you so many times before an exam, when my mom would even start screaming out around the house. Oh, my God, Amani has an exam tomorrow. We’re not going to see because of how anxious I would get.

But she would always calm me down and just, like, talk to me; tell me everything is going to be fine. They were just my biggest supporters.",https://teentrust.ng/as-much-as-you-study-trying-to-get-all-as-dont-let-it-define-you-habiba-aun-valedictorian-to-undergraduates/,https://dailytrust.com
Aligning curricula with industry needs will address poor quality graduates — NOUN best graduating student,"Adekunle Olusegun Michael Itopa is a chemistry teacher at Grait International College, Ota, and a basketball and football coach. He emerged as the 2025 best graduating student of the National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN) from the Department of Peace and Conflict Resolution. In this interview, he spoke about the challenges he encountered and others!!

By Chidimma C. Okeke

How do you feel emerging as the best graduating student?

I’m filled with immense pride and humility to emerge as the best graduating student for 2025. It didn’t kick in at first when I got the news, delayed gratification I guess.

Well, this was a feat I never envisaged. I knew I had done well, just never thought nationally. It shows that the hard work and persistence paid off. I’d like to congratulate other graduates who made the list, especially 15 other first class graduates across the country. It isn’t an easy feat, it’s a privilege, it could have been any of us.

What is it like studying in NOUN?

Well, NOUN is a distant learning programme and unlike conventional Universities that provide campus life, it’s typical work days for most of us. We only go to study centres for registration, material collection, practical for sciences and examination.

What academic challenges do you encounter?

It was a little challenging juggling work and school, especially time management. I work in a secondary school and it’s quite demanding and on days we have basketball or football practice, my closing times extend till 6pm. Well, I made sure to make time for my studies and it was easy to assimilate my course materials because naturally I read anything I can lay my hands on for leisure; books, sport articles, journals. Reading is habitual and that really helped.

What informed your choice of NOUN?

I gained admission into the Federal University of Technology Akure to study chemistry in 2010. I dropped out in 2014 as my passion for music had taken over at the time. Fame evaded me and academia had slipped away. Then came the principal of Grait International College, Ota, P. Y. Folorunsho, who employed me as an assistant chemistry teacher after passing an aptitude test in 2018. He introduced me to NOUN as a platform where I could work and learn. He played a huge part in all of this and to him I’m immensely grateful.

There is a belief that the education Nigerian students receive doesn’t prepare them for industries; what is your take on that?

Although the system is often criticised for being too theoretical, I believe that is why the IT programme was introduced to the educational system to bridge this gap and develop the practical aspect. I had my IT with PocketLawyers. The experience was valuable and I gained a lot from the firm. I’d like to thank Mrs Ngozi Nwabueze, CEO PocketLawyers, for the opportunity to develop. And I believe that strengthening partnerships between the educational institutions and industries can help align curricula with the industry needs. This in turn will help produce better equipped students.

Well, online education is gaining wider acceptance because of its flexibility, affordability and accessibility. Besides, not only are the course materials comparable to conventional universities; they are authored and peer-reviewed by distinguished scholars from conventional universities. The choice of online education depends on one’s personal needs and circumstances – not on academic inferiority.

What is your next plan and goal after here?

Well, graduation is just the start of another race. I’d like to further my studies; it’s a dream to have an MSc abroad but financing that is a constraint. In the meantime, I will take a few professional courses to advance myself.

What is your advice to students who wish to come top of their class too?

My advice to them is that they should manage time properly, enjoy studying, be consistent and exercise if they can; I recommend long-distance running.",https://teentrust.ng/aligning-curricula-with-industry-needs-will-address-poor-quality-graduates-noun-best-graduating-student/,https://dailytrust.com
"How to tackle unemployment, by UNILAG DVC, experts","The Deputy Vice-Chancellor (DVC), Development Services, of University of Lagos (UNILAG), Prof. Afolabi Lesi; the President/Provost of ICLED Business School, Lekki, Lagos, Prof. Olajumoke Familoni, a human capital and leadership expert from the United States (US), Dr. Wayne Puckett, have challenged Nigerian university system to focus more on teaching soft and marketable skills in order to reduce unemployment in the country.

They spoke separately during the contest of ideas among the students of the university, marking the grand finale of the landmark Career Service Programme organised by the university in collaboration with the Innovation Center for Leadership and Entrepreneurial Development (ICLED) Business School, Lekki, Lagos.

Themed: “Solving the Graduate Unemployment Crisis in Nigeria: The Way Forward,” the event was designed to highlight the practical skills, professional exposure, and entrepreneurial readiness acquired by penultimate and final-year students of UNILAG through ICLED’s Skill-Up Initiative training.

SPONSOR AD

The students were exposed to soft skills training in four track areas such as people skills, work-ready, career planning and leadership skills.

Declaring the programme open, Lesi said the university system must teach them those soft skills that would make graduates successful and reduce unemployment.

The DVC said: ‘’The Office of Career Development Services was set up to support students and make them work-ready. This training is part of a series of activities organised by the Office of Career Development Services. This one is in partnership with ICLED, with Professor Olajumoke Familoni.

‘’So, they have a whole series of activities. They have been equipped with skills on how to attend interview, team building, communications and leadership skills, those are the kind of soft skills that you don’t learn from your courses. There are soft skills that are not taught, and you have to acquire those soft skills. So, the university system must teach them those skills that will make them successful.

‘’That’s exactly what we’re trying to do here. I think we need to start listening to our youth. Start listening to their ideas. Of course, they need guidance. That’s what we are here for. But I think they also have ideas and we need to start listening to them. That’s what I think will make a difference.’’

In her remarks, Princess Olajumoke Familoni, a Professor of Entrepreneurship and Management and President of ICLED Business, said soft skills are critical in tackling graduate unemployment. The professor pointed out that the students had been equipped with the skills.

According to her, unemployment is as a result of a mismatch, saying, ‘’We train students in theory without preparing them for the real world. Their presentations show they now understand the importance of industry–academia collaboration. Entrepreneurship is key in addressing graduate unemployment, ensuring that innovations are transformed into jobs and opportunities’’.

Speaking on the programme, Prof. Familoni said: ‘’The event marked the closure of almost two years of preparation. It is the conclusion of the first cohort—students who have undergone six months of training in soft skills, career development, work readiness, and leadership to advance in the university. I am very proud of the students. They appreciate the university for exposing them to this opportunity.’’

On her part, Dr Puckett, who is a Director at ICLED, said actionable steps must be taken to implement ideas suggested by the students and other experts to address unemployment in Nigeria.

Puckett said: ‘’The students are truly amazing. They did an exceptional job integrating the lessons they were given. Achieving so much in just six weeks is very impressive. The students came up with excellent suggestions. These are major challenges, not easily solved. Students should continue discussions after the training. By breaking down these big problems into smaller, actionable steps, they can begin to address unemployment more effectively.’’

In his remarks, the Team Lead for the Office of Career Development Services of the university, Dr. Ayodele Shittu, said the programme was to equip the students with world-of-work and global citizenship skills and empower the students in four important skill areas.

‘’This is to showcase what they have learned for the past two months. They have made Unilag proud. We will see these young stars in high places in the future, influencing policies and decisions globally,’’ Shittu added.",https://dailytrust.com/how-to-tackle-unemployment-by-unilag-dvc-experts,https://dailytrust.com

"In Akwa Ibom, pregnant women, babies die due to poorly-equipped PHCs while govt wastes billions","Queen Purple, 25, keenly looked forward to the arrival of her first child. Pregnancy had caused her nausea and fatigue, and she struggled with the increasing weight of the growing baby.

She attended the primary healthcare centre (PHC) in her community of Emere Oke kingdom in the Eastern Obolo LGA of Akwa Ibom State for antenatal care. However, as her due date drew closer, she was advised to deliver with a traditional birth attendant (TBA) in a neighbouring village – a path many women in the community take.

“The PHC rarely opens at night. So, our community’s women advised me against taking chances in case the baby comes at night,” she recalled.

Five months into her pregnancy, Mrs Purple had witnessed a neighbour lose her baby at childbirth because there was no health worker to attend to her at the PHC after she went into labour at night.

The woman returned home to give birth, but she had serious bleeding, which local remedies failed to stop.

“Because of what I witnessed and the advice I was given, some weeks before my due date, I moved to stay with a TBA in the nearby village,” Mrs Purple said.

However, in January 2024, after several hours of difficult labour, her baby came out lifeless.

“It was one of the worst days of my life. The pregnancy stress I went through for nine months was without a reward. If the health centre functions day and night, my baby would not have died because I would have given birth there.”

Mercy Ishmael had a similar experience before giving birth on 4 May in the same community.

Because the PHC did not open that night, she had to deliver her baby at home. Sadly, it did not survive.

At least, she and Mrs Purple survived to tell their stories. 45-year-old Blessing Jimmy, also from the same village, was not as fortunate.

As she did with her previous five children, the late Mrs Jimmy had to give birth at home when her labour pains began on the night of 6 April. But the labour dragged on longer than usual.

“We had all our babies at home because the health centre was always closed at night,” said her husband, Emmanuel.

After a prolonged obstructed labour, the baby was delivered, but the mother was so weak that she was unable to speak.

She died the next day, and the baby two months later.

“If there were health workers to deliver my mother of the baby, I wouldn’t be motherless today,” lamented their first son, Sam.

Sam Jimmy, still a student, has a big dream of funding medical staff at the PHC to prevent more child and maternal deaths, in dedication to the memory of his mother.

According to Reuben Jonah, the chief of staff to the village head, Emere Oke Kingdom loses women and babies during childbirth due to the inadequacies of its PHC.

No staff, equipment for emergencies, deliveries

This reporter visited the facility in late May. It had no fence or staff quarters. Even if it had health workers, they would not feel safe to work at night to provide emergency services.

The centre has only one full-time employee – Ruth Awajiogak, a Community Health Environmental Worker (CHEW) who is also the officer-in-charge.

An ad-hoc staff member posted to the facility in 2024 does not work every day due to the distance from his home and transport costs.

As a CHEW, Ms Awajiogak is not qualified to take deliveries or provide obstetrics care, according to the Nigerian government’s Minimum Standards for Primary Health Care Centres.

However, having served alone at the facility since 2001, she is often forced to go beyond her role. She said she had conducted at least four deliveries over the years.

She sometimes stayed at the ward without returning home for four days.

Conducting the reporter around the dilapidated facility, Ms Awajiogak lamented that the poor working conditions limited the impact of her services.

She said if the facility were rehabilitated and provided with staff quarters and qualified staff, the community members would be elated to attend for healthcare services.

Emere-Oke PHC reflects the conditions of many other PHCs in oil-rich Akwa Ibom State.

The national standard is for PHCs to provide 24-hour daily services. However, no PHC in the Eastern Obolo Local Government Area does this, due to staff shortage and inadequate facilities. Many others face the same challenges across Akwa Ibom State.

Like Emere-Oke, like Odot

On 12 June 2024, Solomon Wilson and his five-month-old pregnant wife, Uduak, joined their neighbours in celebrating the inauguration of a new Model PHC in Odot, Nsit Atai LGA. Their home is a stone’s throw from the facility, and Mr Wilson recalled the relief he felt.

“We were happy to attend the inauguration because we had planned that my wife would give birth there,” he recalled.

However, on 23 October 2024, when his wife went into labour, they discovered that no health worker had been posted to the centre.

Mrs Wilson had to rely on TBAs for the delivery. However, the birth had complications, leading to her death.

Although their baby survived, Mr Wilson said his wife’s death was avoidable.

During four visits to the facility between 10 and 25 May, this reporter met no health worker or security guard.

The chief of Ikot Ekpuk, where the facility is located, Dickson Etim, said a few workers were posted to the facility in late 2024.

“At night, the few hands there retire home. We need nurses. There is no medicine there either. Government should employ more workers and supervise them,” he pleaded.

The Akwa Ibom State Government inaugurated a new ‘model PHC’ in Abiakana, a community in Ika LGA, on 21 February. However, four months later, the facility remained locked as no health worker had been posted there.

The village head, John Afangideh, confirmed that the PHC had not commenced operations.

“Since the facility is yet to be operational, when we get sick, we go far away to other communities to get services. Our women who desire to get their children immunised pay up to N2,000 transport fare. When our women want to give birth, they go to TBAs and sometimes die in the process,” said Mr Afangideh.

The condition at the model health centre at Utu in Etim Ekpo LGA was not different when this reporter visited the facility on the nights and early mornings of 17 and 18 May – no medical staff or security officer was on duty.

The community members told PREMIUM TIMES that the facility operates only during the day due to staff shortage.

At the Oboyo Ikot Ita PHC in Nsit Ibom LGA, on the night of 7 May and the morning of 8 May, only two security guards were there.

They explained that the facility had five medical staff members, who sometimes work at night.

The story was not so different at the Eyulor PHC in Uruefong Oruko LGA.

When the reporter visited on the nights of 29 and 30 May, he met the officer-in-charge, Rose Umoh.

Mrs Umoh was the only medical staff member assigned to the facility. She expressed her concerns about the facility.

Her worries were the leaky roof and unfinished work on the staff quarters of the facility.

The Deputy Village Council Chairman of Eyulor, Okon Okpoyo, was also unhappy that the facility had only one medical staff member.

“The nurse there has made significant sacrifices to stay in the facility since it was commissioned on 21 May 2025. When it rains, the place is flooded due to the leaky roof,” he said.

“The keys of the doors were not fixed for the staff quarters and the main facility, hence she is unable to use them. She has complained several times, and this may discourage her from making further sacrifices.”

Akwa Ibom has some health centres it labels as model healthcare centres. These are well constructed and often have the necessary equipment, although they also suffer from staff shortages.

Investigations by this reporter reveal that among the model healthcare centres in Akwa Ibom, Eyulor PHC is the only one with shabby construction. When it rains, the facility becomes unusable. Rainwater from the leaky roof, witnessed by this reporter, could also destroy the medical equipment at the facility. However, all the model healthcare centres suffer from staff shortages.

Personnel shortage affecting maternal care

On 4 June, this reporter submitted a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to the Executive Secretary of Akwa Ibom State Primary Health Development Agency, Eno Attah, seeking data on the distribution of health care workers across the state’s PHCs.

The request specifically asked for staffing levels in 13 key positions, including medical officers, community health officers (CHO), nurses/midwives, community health extension workers (CHEWs), pharmacy technicians, junior community health extension workers, environmental officers, medical records officers, laboratory technicians, health attendants/assistants, security personnel and general maintenance staff.

Mr Attah did not respond to the request, despite his acknowledgement of it and several reminders through phone calls, text and WhatsApp messages.

However, credible sources in the agency revealed that Akwa Ibom State currently has 2,164 workers across its 468 PHCs, including ad-hoc staff funded through the Basic Health Care Provision Fund.

This implies that on average, a PHC has fewer than five workers, a far cry from the 24 recommended by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency as a minimum.

Due to this shortage, PHCs, especially in the state’s rural areas, have only one worker, often a CHEW, and a nurse at best. These facilities lack laboratory technicians, pharmacy technicians and medical officers.

Due to a shortage of healthcare workers, maternal care indicators in Akwa Ibom State have been very poor in the last few years.

For instance, according to the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey 2023-2024, Akwa Ibom State has one of the lowest percentages (38.6 per cent) of live births delivered in a health facility in the country. It ranks lowest among the 17 southern states of Nigeria. It also ranks lower than five of the six north-central states and three out of six north-east states.

The report further shows that Akwa Ibom has one of the lowest percentages of births delivered by a skilled provider (51.5 per cent) in Nigeria, the lowest across the southern and North-central states except Niger.

As a result, Akwa Ibom State now has a prevalence of maternal mortality rate of 774 per 100,000 lives, according to District Health Information Software 2, a free and open-source software platform primarily used for managing and analysing health information in Nigeria.

Proposed employment of 1,000 health workers

In June, the Akwa Ibom State Head of Civil Service, Effiong Essien, announced that the state government would employ 1,000 medical personnel.

However, he did not state the number that would be posted to PHCs.

When this reporter reached out to the Commissioner for Health, Ekem Emmanuel, and shared the findings of this investigation, he said the government was aware of the staffing challenges in the primary healthcare sector and that it was responding by the 1,000 medical personnel to be employed.

When asked why the Governor Umo Eno administration waited for two years before intervening, the commissioner said reviews of the number of personnel to be employed had caused the delay.

Even if the proposed 1,000 medical personnel are employed and posted to the 468 PHCs, the staff strength would still fall below the minimum standard set by the NPHCDA.

For PHCs in Nigeria, the agency provides that for effective healthcare delivery, a PHC should have at least 19 medical personnel and five support staff, totalling 24.

This number will provide qualified staff for each of the medical units and provide an opportunity for staff to run shifts, including night, thus being available to address emergency cases.

Staffing the 468 PHCs in Akwa Ibom State with 24 workers each means 11,232 staff are required, in addition to the supporting staff. If all the 1,000 healthcare workers to be employed are sent to the PHCs with the existing 2,164 workers, there will still be a shortfall of 8,068 workers.

The Commissioner for Health explained why the state cannot meet the staff standards prescribed by the NPHCDA, saying development is a process.

“How many countries have that standard? Even in those countries we refer to, do they have that doctor/patient ratio? It is a prescription. It is ideal, but even in the UK, the government is complaining that they don’t have enough doctors. Why do you think they are taking Nigerians?

“Our approach must be systematic. We recognise that there is an issue. We are taking steps to solve the issue, and we are making progress towards it,” Mr Emmanuel said.

Staff shortage thwarting government efforts

The Akwa Ibom administration also appears to be taking steps to address infrastructural challenges at the primary healthcare level.

An analysis of the 2023 and 2024 Revised Budget of Akwa Ibom State shows that the administration budgeted N6.47 billion for the construction of 15 model PHCs, of which nine have so far been commissioned.

According to the 2025 approved budget, N7.55 billion was voted for the building and rehabilitation of 16 PHCs.

However, as shown by this investigation, the benefits of the model PHCs have yet to be optimised because of the shortage of healthcare professionals at the facilities.

This reporter visited five of the model PHCs to assess the provision of emergency services at night.

Out of the five, in Utu in Etim Ekpo, Abiakana in Ika, Odot in Nsit Atai, Oboyo Ikot Ita in Nsit Ibom, and Eyulor in Uruefong Oruko, only the Eyulor PHC had a medical staff at night.

Consequently, the unavailability of manpower at these facilities at night continues to contribute to the high maternal and child mortality rates in the state.

Billions spent on 13 SUVs

Contrary to the claims by the Commissioner for Health that the government was constrained by funds to meet the minimum staffing standard, data show that the challenge is being aggravated by poor prioritisation.

For instance, the 2024 Full Year Budget Performance Report of Akwa Ibom State shows that the State Primary Health Care Development Agency spent N37.1 million as personnel cost on the 2,164 staff in the health facilities and in the agency.

If 10,820 workers (2,164 multiplied by five) are added to the existing 2167 staff, expenditures at the same ratio will mean the total 12,984 (which is 1,752 above the recommended minimum standard), would in a fiscal year consume N222.6 million as personnel cost in the state’s 468 PHCs.

That N222.6million is 3.9 per cent of the N5.59 billion personnel cost of the Hospitals Management Board, which administers the staff of the 41 government hospitals in the state.

Meanwhile, the funds for those staff would not be difficult to get if the government prioritises it. In May 2025, the state governor gave new SUVs to 13 National Assembly members despite the lawmakers already receiving similar vehicles from the federal government.

The donation sparked criticism with calls that the funds should have been channelled to critical sectors such as healthcare.

According to the 2025 Approved Budget of Akwa Ibom State, each of the SUVs costs N100 million, and the 13 cost N1.3 billion.

At a personnel cost of N222.6 million for 12,984 staff, if the N1.3 billion spent on the exotic vehicles were redirected to the staff needs of PHCs, it would cover at least five years’ salary (N1.113bn) with N187 million left.

Alabuga Migrant Battalion: Zambia’s first contact,"Late last year, the world was alerted to the disturbing news that Russia was recruiting hundreds of young African women, aged 18–22, to manufacture drones in a military-industrial compound called Alabuga, 1,000 kilometres east of Moscow. The reports also said that the recruits—from at least 15 African countries—were promised good salaries and skills training, but that once there, they were often trapped, facing tax deductions, dangerous working conditions, strict surveillance, and difficulties in returning home.

In the past six months, a ZAM team in seven African countries, including PREMIUM TIMES in Nigeria, investigated the Russian recruitment exercise—and why so many young Africans grab the chance to go, sometimes even after having been warned. This Zambia chapter confirms that, once there, it is almost impossible for Alabuga recruits to freely contact home, or even to speak out publicly at all.

When we finally get to speak to a young African woman in Alabuga, the contrast with the cheerful PR shown to the Zambian public could not be greater. Brochures circulated through various media, events hosted by Russian-linked associations in the capital, and even talk shows on private TV have so far featured only smiling girls in school-like uniforms, accompanied by testimonials praising the wonderful opportunities the programme has given them. But speaking with Tabitha* casts a very different light on what the recruits are experiencing there.

It has taken us more than seven months of trying to finally make contact with an “Alabuga girl”. Getting through to a dormitory (advertised as ‘cosy’ in the supposedly ‘loving’ Alabuga environment), we find one, among seven young women of different nationalities, willing to speak to us about her experiences. From the way she speaks, she is clearly from southern Africa.

But happiness is not the impression we at MakanDay, the Lusaka-based journalism centre I work for, get from Ms Tabitha. Even though she is apparently interested in informing us, she has repeatedly postponed our call and has nearly withdrawn altogether, answering us in the end only to voice her second thoughts. She then relents.

“Advanced materials”

Among the first things she says is that, even after close to a year, she still does not fully understand the Alabuga programme or what happens inside the compound. Among the industrial operations she says she has observed are the manufacture of automotive, construction, and what she calls “advanced materials”. “I can’t understand this company (the Alabuga Start Programme in the Special Economic Zone) and why so many people from around the world are here. Maybe they want to attract investors or something,” she says.

Asked about the military drones that are reportedly produced at her workplace, she says that she “can’t know everything that goes on here. Because this is not just one place, it is a massive piece of land with many industries.” She adds that even her identification card restricts her movements within the zone, and then asks for details of the work that she does to be withheld for fear of being identified.

Tax deductions

She has been there for the work opportunity and to save money for her family and her own future. “The salary is definitely good compared to the salaries back home,” she continues. “Of course, they didn’t mention in their adverts that during the first six months of the programme, we would face a 30 per cent tax deduction from our salaries.” She says she only discovered the deduction after arriving in Russia, and she still does not know what the tax is for.

There have also been other disappointments. “Some of us here are unable to cope with the workload and the strict workplace culture,” she says, refusing to be drawn into expanding on what that means, but adding that many young people “have left the programme.” “You find people just go back. A lot have gone back.”

Not convinced by much-distributed Alabuga material, – inter alia in the form of videos and comic strips – exhorting young women to learn Russian, embrace the culture, find friends, love and perhaps even a new home in Russia, Ms Tabitha is adamant that she herself will return home after the programme next year. She dreams of living in her home country again and investing her savings there. However, she has become aware that it may be difficult to transfer the saved funds out of Russia.

“Because of sanctions,” she says, though this is likely only part of the problem: Russia has itself also introduced certain bans on foreigners trying to send money home.

When asked to introduce us to the other girls on the programme, or even her family at home, she agrees but cautions that “many are unwilling to talk” because of the “negative reports that have been written” about Alabuga in the international press. She explains that two girls in her dormitory at Alabuga are actively assisting in Russia’s recruitment drive, giving online talks to encourage more girls to sign up.

We wait for Ms Tabitha to communicate again, to give us more contacts, but she never does.

The recruitment drive

MakanDay started its quest to discover what really goes on in Alabuga after international reports were published in October last year, showing that young African women looking for opportunities abroad were offered “fellowships” in the programme, only to end up in a manufacturing facility producing Iranian Shahed drones for use in the war against Ukraine.

Small fingers

Why Alabuga wants only very young women—applications are reserved for those between 18 and 22 years of age—has been explained with theories ranging from “typically female precision” and “small fingers” to “they are easier to dominate.” But some reports and clips openly advertised “love” and “finding a wealthy husband” at Alabuga, such as here, indicating a broader demographic goal. The Great Lakes chapter in this transnational investigation quotes a male Alabuga participant saying that “several girls got pregnant” during his stay there.

Satellite photos

Among our first efforts had been to try and picture what the Alabuga facility comprised. Contrary to the PR material that showed girls in school uniforms and talked of “study,” satellite photos did not appear to include an actual college or university. “This looks like a factory, not a college,” said a Zambian professional who has studied in Russia, when MakanDay showed her pictures of the compound. “I have never seen a college in Russia that looks like this, and I have been to four cities there. They pride themselves in education, and a structure like this as a college would be shut down.” Another former student in Russia questioned the salary figures after being shown an advert promising a 70,000 Rubles ($860) salary. “The average Russian salary is 30,000 Rubles per month. This just sounds too good to be true.”

Government silence

We asked the Zambian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Immigration Department for comment, but despite repeated requests, neither institution responded. Among other questions, MakanDay sought to know what the government understood about the programme and whether any investigation had been conducted into the purpose for which Zambians were being recruited. Instead, the government remained silent, even as recruitment drives spread widely across social media.

Other southern African governments have kept similarly quiet. According to Ms Tabitha, the only time she had become alerted that there might be something concerning about Alabuga was when immigration officials at her departure initially delayed clearing her papers, questioning both the programme and her young age, since she was only in her early twenties at the time. Eventually, however, she was allowed to travel.

Agricultural drones

After the official Zambian requests for comment failed, MakanDay sought a response from the Russian embassy in Lusaka but received no reply there either. Immediately afterwards, however, the embassy began inviting other media—perhaps considered more friendly—to visit the Alabuga Start facility.

Those who participated in these all-expenses-paid PR trips would acknowledge later that their role was largely limited to interviewing selected recruits within the compound and being shown only a few aspects of the operations. One, when asked whether they had toured any facility producing military drones, responded: “The only drone manufacturing plant we visited was one that (according to his guides) produces agricultural drones for irrigation.”

Asking the Zambia–Russia Graduates Cultural Association (ZAMRUS) for information also proved futile. While director Patricia Kalinga has actively promoted the programme publicly, published its material on ZAMRUS social media, and accompanied journalists on PR trips to Russia, she never responded to our questions. The Russia House in Lusaka, which has also engaged in promotional activities for Alabuga, only informed us that MakanDay’s query to the Russian embassy had been passed on to it. An official at the House promised in that message to respond to our questions, but never did.

Anti-human-trafficking

A last development before our deadline was a confirmation from a source within the Department of Anti-Human Trafficking that the unit had been asked to look into the Alabuga programme at the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Immigration Department. Talking to the source, it became clear that the request had come to the department shortly after MakanDay had approached the Ministry for comment. The source added that the department intends to interview someone from ZAMRUS, but that had not yet happened “because of a busy schedule.”

While high unemployment and lack of prospects in Zambia are known to cause many of its young people to seek opportunities abroad, it remains a mystery why the Zambian authorities are not taking a more proactive role in guarding the safety and prospects of its youth at Alabuga, and more generally in Russia. This is all the more concerning because a Zambian has already died on Russia’s frontlines. 23-year-old Zambian student Lemekhani Nyirenda, together with 37-year-old Tanzanian Nemes Tarimom, had both been imprisoned in Russia on dubious drug charges, but were offered freedom in exchange for joining the Kremlin-funded Wagner Group. The deal resulted in their deaths on the Ukrainian battlefield.

A letter asking the Zambian embassy in Moscow whether it was ensuring the safety of Zambian girls at Alabuga was acknowledged but ultimately unanswered.

Migrant Battalion: Looking for Oceanne in Cameroon,"Late last year, the world was alerted to the disturbing news that Russia was recruiting hundreds of young African women, aged 18–22, to manufacture drones in a military-industrial compound 1,000 km east of Moscow called Alabuga. The reports also said that the recruits—from at least 15 African countries—were promised good salaries and skills training, but that, once there, they were often trapped, facing tax deductions, dangerous working conditions, strict surveillance, and difficulties in returning home.

In the past six months, a ZAM team in seven African countries, including PREMIUM TIMES in Nigeria, investigated the Russian recruitment exercise—and why so many young Africans grab the chance to go, sometimes even after being warned. The Cameroon chapter of this transnational investigation portrays a recruiter who says his efforts are in line with a United Nations drive for the “financial empowerment of girls.”

“Please, where can I register? I want to fight for both Ukraine and Russia,” says a Facebook post by Gertrude Njong from April this year. A post from the same period, ostensibly by a young man named Tamnjong Desmond Platini, agrees: “How do they do it? I want to join the list. Better I should waste in a foreign land fighting than die of hunger in Cameroon.” A third account, called ‘Cameroon legit info line,’ says, “Better to die in Russia or Ukraine than to die (here) and perish,” and gets 31 likes, several of which are laughing emojis.

This is Facebook, of course. In real life, many Cameroonians may think twice before actually joining a war in a cold, foreign country. According to Africa Report, however, several thousand have in fact taken precisely this step.

Many individuals from this group have left for Russia to take up jobs and fellowships in military-adjacent fields, such as security, logistics, IT, or the Alabuga programme.

The primary motive for this trek to Russia, as it—perhaps unsurprisingly—emerges from my interviews, is the desperation among our youth about the future in Cameroon itself. Here, a now 92-year-old autocrat, President Paul Biya, rules over a regime that ranks 140th on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions list, even lower than Mali, Liberia, and Gabon. Mr Biya has recently nominated himself again for the elections in October this year, and Cameroon’s Constitutional Council has excluded the principal opposition leader from even participating in these elections.

This being the case, many among the country’s young have come to believe that oppression, poverty, and a glaring absence of ways to develop a meaningful existence for oneself may be eternal, and that protesting is futile. So, they get out, whether on boats or with an easy (very easy to get, especially when compared to a visa for anywhere else) Russian visa.

“Opportunity of a lifetime”

Audrey (20) and Ebane (18), acquaintances of mine, are considering the opportunity offered to them by the military-linked Alabuga Start Programme. It sounds appealing, they say, because it is not actually about fighting in the war, it is for girls, and you get money to send home. Ms Audrey tells me she found this “opportunity of a lifetime” through an Alabuga Start advert on Facebook and has been calling the number of the representative listed on the platform to learn more about enlisting. “My family struggles to make ends meet. My mom works part-time, but our income barely covers our expenses,” she says. “I don’t see much hope here. This programme feels like my best chance at a better future.” Her friend, 18-year-old Ms Ebane, is excited by the all-expenses-paid promises. “This is a great opportunity to go abroad and start a new life. Things are difficult here.”

When I tell them about the investigation that I am part of, and the international reports that have shown some of the promises may be too good to be true, they are disappointed. I leave them immersed in doubt.

In the following days and weeks, I tried to find Cameroonian girls in Alabuga. One particular online profile, of a beautiful young lady called Oceanne Stecy, had attracted my attention. Maybe I could find her? She seemed accomplished and self-assured in the YouTube video I, along with many other Cameroonians, had seen, walking along what seemed like well-kept lawns and white buildings in a place that, judging by the clothing, seemed cold. Alabuga? Was she really there? An editor flashed questions on the screen: What is your name? How did you hear about Alabuga? How do you like it here? She confidently answered, smiling throughout, repeating that she was happy and well cared for, and inviting fellow young women from Cameroon to also join the moving train to this Special Economic Zone in Russia.

Trying to contact Ms Oceanne, however, had been unsuccessful. Name searches on the internet had only turned up girls with the same unusual name appearing on job listings as au pairs in Abidjan, Germany, and elsewhere in Russia. Did Oceanne even exist?

Together with a friend of mine who works for a telemarketing company, we phone the number of the Alabuga representative in Cameroon: Michel Ateba, who, according to photos on his LinkedIn profile, is a tall, good-looking man in classy but modest dress. My friend pretends that she wants to register, but tells him she is concerned about the negative reports we have read. He assures us warmly that all of that is not true and is merely Western propaganda. He repeats that we’ll receive good salaries, free housing, and skills training, and won’t have to worry about anything. His company, Enangue Holdings, even offers passport fee assistance for 40 young girls from poor backgrounds. The passport fee in Cameroon is about $200.

Partnering with Russian taxis

Enangue Holdings can certainly afford some assistance with our travel perils, it seems, based on research into its background. Mr Ateba is a director of many companies and holds government contracts for several. In one photo, he is dressed in a shirt made from the ruling party’s typical fabric and design.

Mr Ateba has been actively promoting Russian-Cameroon business and trade relations for about nine years and has also entered a partnership with and obtained an operations license for the Russian taxi company Yango in the lucrative taxi business in Cameroon.

He has recently been named a member of the Cameroon Business Council, overseeing all of Cameroon’s trade with Russia.

“I don’t want to talk anymore with these journalists who just put the Western lies to me,” he explains when I phone him directly, identifying myself as a journalist. Then he agrees to talk to me, since he says I might really want to listen.

Emphasising that his Alabuga recruitment efforts are “backed by the Cameroonian Ministry of Women Empowerment and the Family” (MINPROFF), he wants me to understand that this is all about the “financial empowerment of the girl child,” which is “in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.” He then adds that he is also “actively engaged” with Cameroon’s Ministry of External Relations (MINREX) to promote Alabuga. He has personally been to the compound, he says, and assures me that the girls in Alabuga are safe and doing well. “There are 13 (from Cameroon) there now, but we are expected to send a hundred more this year.” Photos on Enangue Holdings’ Facebook page show Mr Ateba himself at Alabuga, smiling and surrounded by girls.

Vehement denial

I ask why Alabuga is only for young women, with an age limit of 22, but I don’t get a straight answer. “They may consider males in the future, but for now it’s just girls,” he says. When I then raise some of the issues reported by international media, such as exploitation and maltreatment, Mr Ateba once again vehemently denies them. “Who told you that? This is just propaganda fueled by the West against Russia. Alabuga is not about the war in Ukraine. There are many factories there, and over a thousand girls from various nations, including Asians. Why is there a focus on Africa in the international reports? The case is simply that Western countries have outlived their opportunities for Africans, and they don’t want Russia to take the lead.” Sternly: “It’s all a smear campaign. We are following up on that.”

How, I ask. “We are assembling a record of all these websites. And we’ll take some journalists and government officials to Alabuga so they can see for themselves. Maybe later this year or next year. The partners (in Russia) are working on that.” He adds that in the meantime, you either believe that what we are telling you is true, or you believe what people are saying on the internet. “These girls are fine there.”

I ask if I can speak with one of them, just to make sure that they are indeed fine, and mention Oceanne Stecy. Maybe I can talk to her? But Mr Ateba says he cannot facilitate contact with her, or any other girls in Alabuga, or their families in Cameroon at the time. “My Russian partners have not given me approval to connect any girls for an interview for the moment,” he adds. “If the partners approve such an interview, I will let you know.”

He hasn’t come back to me, several weeks later.

Unanswered calls

Having failed in my search for Ms Oceanne, I ask a contact at MINREX if they really are partnering with Michel Ateba and Enangue Holdings in promoting Alabuga recruitment. Speaking anonymously, my source says he has not heard of that and has been told that Cameroon “is working towards discouraging such ventures,” because “in some cases Cameroonians had to be repatriated from countries where they were subjected to poor working conditions.” However, when I ask more questions about Alabuga, my source becomes frightened and tells me to “get approval from the Ministry of Communication and follow the regulated procedures to interview government sources,” an avenue that, as every journalist in Cameroon knows, will be difficult.

Sadly, I have no contacts at MINPROFF; the website for the department does not even load, which is not an exceptional occurrence in Cameroon. Phone calls to officials whose numbers I managed to get later at both ministries are left unanswered.

This is, again, not surprising. Citizens in this country are accustomed to their government not responding to individual or civil society concerns, and media queries are regularly left unanswered—unless the reporter is friendly with a politician, who then often uses the reporter as a public relations agent for him or herself.

The silence is agony for many families, especially those whose children left for Russia’s military service. Cameroonian channel Equinox TV recently featured the family of Eric Donald Demlabing, a former student at the University of Dschang’s Faculty of Letters and Human Sciences in the West region, who travelled to Russia in October 2024. It was Mr Demlabing’s second time, as he had previously returned after completing his first stint of military service. According to his father, interviewed by Equinox, his son’s decision to go back was motivated by an offer of 2 million CFA francs (just over €3,500).

The father also told Equinox that the last time he heard from his son was in February 2025, when Demlabing sent videos to friends from the frontlines describing going two weeks without water — there was only tea for drinking — and developing rashes. The family had no contact with him since. In one of the videos from the Ukraine front that they came across later, the father said, a voice was saying: “It wasn’t easy, bro… many people died between February and now, it’s not easy here, bro… we don’t have a choice.”

Service secret de la résistance

In desperate attempts to find out what is happening amid silence from the authorities, Cameroonians are flocking to social media in search of information about those who have left for Russia. A Facebook whistleblower account run by a diaspora-based individual called Nzui Manto, which has 638,000 followers, has become the go-to portal for families missing a loved one. Mr Manto, whose email address is ‘servicesecretdelaresistance’ and who is rumoured to be a “revolutionary,” appears to have strong sources, particularly regarding the Russian front in Ukraine; even Africa Defence Magazine quotes him on his estimate that 65 Cameroonian soldiers have died there so far.

Often, when families report that they haven’t seen their fathers, children, nephews, or nieces for a while, ‘Nzui Manto’ promises to investigate and report back. In this way, he has informed scores of Cameroonian families that their loved ones have died, giving the places, dates, and circumstances that led to their demise. Responses like “Oh no, this was my uncle” or “I worked with him when I was teaching” indicate that the families in question lend credibility to Manto’s reports.

Memorial services have been organised following the Facebook portal’s feedback, with no peep from either Cameroonian or Russian authorities. The last death report on Nzui Manto’s Facebook page is dated 24 August.

Career prospects

But not all who go die; it is an unfortunate truth that career prospects, even for soldiers, may in some cases still be better in Russia than in Cameroon, where soldiers are dying in wars with Boko Haram in the north and armed separatists in the English-speaking regions. When I come across a Cameroonian contact who is now an officer in Russia’s military intelligence, he says that “many simply travel on a tourist visa, then see application forms to join the army, all posted at major places like the tram station. Then, if they want to, they go there and enlist themselves.”

He does not want to talk about himself or how he ended up collecting intelligence on “enemy” Ukraine, but continues: “This is how it happens generally: the recruiters (then) leave you a text message—in French if you don’t understand Russian. This message contains directions on how you get to your training camp. Once you get there, they train you for two to three months, and after that, you are dispatched to fight against Ukraine.” Though cautious throughout our conversation, my contact doesn’t seem too eager to return to Cameroon.

Mixed messages

In March this year, the Cameroonian Ministry of Defence announced a crackdown on soldiers deserting the army to fight in Russia. In the press release, Minister Delegate at the Presidency in charge of Defence, Joseph Assomo, urged all heads of the country’s defence and security forces to “please urgently take all appropriate measures to tighten control over personnel within your ranks” in this regard.

Two months later, however, on 26 May—at a celebration of Africa Day at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow—Cameroonian ambassador to Russia Mahamat Salé still celebrated how “Russia contributes to the training of African personnel” and that Cameroon “owed a great deal” to Russia “in the sphere of security and the military.” In a report for the Russian site afrinz.ru, which says it is “a Russian news agency about events on the African continent” with the “goal to mutually expand the knowledge of Russians and Africans about each other,” he was further quoted as saying that Russia was now Cameroon’s “main partner outside the continent” and that “even in the most remote villages in Africa, you can see children waving the flags of the Russian Federation.”

According to the report, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during his speech at the same reception that Russia “would continue to assist African countries in strengthening their defence capabilities and countering terrorism.”

A letter sent by ZAM, asking Ambassador Mahamat Salé—who is, at 74, among the younger generation of Cameroon’s state representatives—for comment on Cameroonian deaths and disappearances in Russia, was not answered.

INVESTIGATION: Russia’s Alabuga Scandal in the Great Lakes: Caught in the Snow,"Late last year, the world was alerted to the disturbing news that Russia was recruiting hundreds of young African women, aged 18–22, to go and manufacture drones in a military-industrial compound a thousand km east of Moscow called Alabuga. The reports also stated that the recruits—from at least 15 African countries—were promised good salaries and skills training but, once there, were often trapped, facing tax deductions, dangerous working conditions, strict surveillance, and difficulties in returning home.

In the past six months, a ZAM team in seven African countries, including PREMIUM TIMES in Nigeria, investigated the Russian recruitment exercise—and why so many young Africans take the opportunity, sometimes even after being warned. This Great Lakes chapter shows that not only women but also young men are recruited to Alabuga, where they face pressure to join the army and fight at the front. It also shows that their own governments offer little help and that returnees experience shame and trauma.

When 19-year-old Silas* left his family home in Sampeke, rural Burundi, in early 2023, he believed he was embarking on the opportunity of a lifetime. Russian recruiters had promised him vocational training, steady employment, and a chance to send money home through the prestigious Alabuga Start programme. He had seen videos of modern factories, comfortable dormitories, and smiling African workers. “What they didn’t show us were the uniforms waiting for us,” he says, telling how, 18 months later, he was dodging Ukrainian artillery fire in a frozen trench outside Bakhmut.

Mr Silas’s journey from the Alabuga drone factory to the battlefield illustrates how the programme connects to the military, especially for men. After six months assembling drone components, he and several other East Africans were transferred to a military training facility in Rostov-on-Don. “They said it was the next phase of our vocational training, security work,” Mr Silas recalls. “By then, we understood what was really happening, but the contracts were clear: desertion meant prison or worse.”

The training was brief and brutal. Within weeks, Mr Silas found himself in eastern Ukraine, part of a unit that included men from Ghana, Nigeria, Morocco, and other African nations. Many of these recruits did not volunteer at all, he says; they were sent to the front lines through deceit and coercion. “The mortality rate was horrific,” Mr Silas continues. “They used us in human wave attacks, treating men as cannon fodder. So many of the people I trained with in Rostov-on-Don were lying dead on the ground in Donetsk.”

His escape came during a chaotic retreat when Ukrainian forces overran their position. Rather than regrouping with Russian forces, Silas surrendered to Ukrainian authorities, who classified him as a prisoner of war. He was subsequently included in a prisoner exchange at the Belarus border, a common location for such swaps. From Belarus, he made his way to the Polish border, where he applied for asylum and was granted temporary protection status as a conflict refugee. He later travelled within the Schengen zone to another EU country, where he is now awaiting formal asylum and refugee status.

Sophisticated recruitment

In Africa’s Great Lakes region, Russia is systematically exploiting economic desperation and educational aspirations to fuel its war in Ukraine. Searching social media and network contacts, ZAM found young people from Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania recruited into roles ranging from drone assembly to frontline combat. They had enlisted by responding to the “Academic Mobility Consortium” through a website called RAFU, the Russian-African Network University, which offers thousands of Russian-sponsored scholarships, or through the site of a group of Russian state universities, RACUS, which specifically lists Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Burundi as priority recruitment countries.

The recruitment websites look legitimate, featuring official Russian government endorsements. Recruitment also occurred at events at Russian cultural centres and embassies in Dar es Salaam and other major cities in the region, which regularly host education fairs promoting study opportunities. Additionally, so-called Russia Houses have been established in several regional capitals, ostensibly to promote language learning and cultural exchange.

On social media, TikTok videos featuring young African women at modern Russian facilities garner hundreds of thousands of views across East Africa. Facebook groups with names like ‘Study in Russia – Great Lakes’ and ‘African Success in Russia’ share success stories and application information. In Kenya, social media influencers target university students and recent graduates frustrated with limited employment opportunities, offering STEM graduates advanced training in engineering or technology. The recruitment networks extend into the Democratic Republic of Congo, where ongoing conflict has created large populations of displaced youth, and the Central African Republic, where Russian Wagner mercenaries have established a significant presence.

In Uganda, a security source confided that he has seen many young men go to Alabuga or the Russian front after having been promised “jobs as guards, security trainers, or military advisors. They work with local recruiting companies here, and most of the people go without knowing exactly what they are getting involved in. For young men with limited prospects, earning ten times their local salary seems worth any risk.”

Modernity and opportunity

Analysis of social media activity shows coordinated efforts across platforms, with content specifically tailored to different regional audiences. “The content is professionally produced and psychologically sophisticated,” explains Burundian medical doctor Rodrigue Ndabashinze, who has worked with communities affected by displacement and labour export, including individuals like Mr Peter, who have returned from Russia. “(The promoters) understand exactly what appeals to young East Africans—modernity, opportunity, escape from limited prospects.”

But the returnees Mr Ndabashinze has seen have been disappointed and damaged, he says. “The psychological impact may be even worse than the physical. These young people, who left home with dreams and hope, return traumatised, ashamed, and often unable to discuss their experiences with their families.” He adds that their silence is sometimes because they were forced to sign non-disclosure agreements as a condition of their release. “Others fear retaliation against family members if they speak publicly.”

The Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Tatarstan has become ground zero for Russia’s most sophisticated recruitment operation in Africa. An estimated 800 women aged 18–22, but also young men like Mr Silas, have been recruited under the pretences of a “work-study programme,” with participants earning a starting salary of $860 a month while, as the brochures say, “gaining valuable experience” in fields described as the services industry, IT, and logistics.

Also, like Mr Silas, recruit Peter* (23, from Burundi) discovered a different reality upon arrival. First, “they immediately confiscated our phones and passports.” The drone factory itself offered mainly very labour-intensive manual work, particularly in the manufacture of the airframe. Peter worked at the facility for six months before managing to return home. He describes the 12-hour shifts assembling components for Shahed drones as agonising: “The worst part wasn’t the work, it was realising that the things we were building were going to kill people—Ukrainian civilians, maybe children. But for that period, leaving wasn’t an option. I was trapped.” Reluctant to provide details of how he did it, Peter eventually made his way back home.

ZAM was able to verify both his and Mr Silas’s accounts of events with families and acquaintances in Burundi, as well as through photos on their phones.

Stuck in Belarus

ZAM also established contact with a 22-year-old Rwandan who is currently stranded in Belarus after joining and completing the Alabuga programme. Speaking anonymously, he says he has made four attempts to cross into Poland, only to be arrested and returned each time. “His family in Belgium has tried everything—lawyers, diplomatic contacts, even hiring smugglers,” says a family friend, speaking from Brussels. “The Belarusian authorities won’t let him leave; they don’t care much about migrants.” Belarus has weaponised migrants’ presence in border zones by trapping people on its territory and pushing them toward the Polish border, creating pressure and instability for neighbouring countries. “But the Polish border guards won’t let him in either,” the relative continues. “He’s trapped in the midpoint, and we’re running out of options. Belarus is not a good place to be. He was once arrested, and we had to bribe the Belarusians for him to be released.”

The case highlights a broader pattern of abandonment by Russia after recruits decide they don’t want to continue on the path (often military) presented to them. Several sources confirmed that once recruits complete their “training” or labour assignments, many find themselves effectively stateless, unable or too ashamed to return home, and unwelcome in Russia without continued service.

Their own governments are not offering help, they say. A mother from Kanyosha, Bujumbura, in Burundi, whose 21-year-old son vanished four months after his arrival in Russia for purported engineering studies, expressed her frustration with official inaction: “We’ve approached everyone we think can help. Everyone expresses sympathy, but no one takes action. It’s like our children don’t matter.” Her son had travelled to Russia accompanied by a close friend, who disappeared at the same time, according to the mother. “We just hear unconfirmed reports that they might have been killed by a drone strike in Ukraine. There is no official confirmation or any information from Russian authorities, nor from officials here in Burundi,” she stated.

A troubling lack of care

Indifference, or the implicit cooperation of East African governments with the Russian agenda, permeates all the experiences. African governments have generally shown a troubling lack of care for their citizens, with some official documents even promoting the programme. In East Africa, Ugandan ambassador Moses Kizige publicly announced in 2022 that “this year Alabuga Polytechnic offered Uganda five scholarships and is open to enrolling more”; he was later seen visiting the compound. Kenyan ambassador Peter Mathuki has publicly promoted the programme, saying he was “impressed” with Alabuga (1). No public statements warning of the military-adjacent nature of the Alabuga programme have been issued by any African government to date. Rwanda and Burundi have remained entirely silent on the issue, offering no official responses despite requests from media outlets for comment.

In Rwanda, Batamurizi* (24) almost fell for the Alabuga programme’s promises of hospitality and tourism training for young women. “The videos they show feature African women in modern kitchens, serving food to Russian customers. But it’s a fantasy designed to exploit dreams of escape from poverty here.” She had wanted to go herself but aborted her flight to Russia after an alert from her cousin, who shared a screenshot of a message he had received from a friend in Poland. “In Russia, new job offers specifically for young girls (is) slavery,” it said, explaining that recruits were paid “700 US$ per month and most of the money goes to the company to pay for bed and food. Labour all day and night. They produce the drones and other weapons to attack Ukraine. And now way to go out!! (sic).” The message stopped her in her tracks. However, three of her friends, with whom she had studied, went to Alabuga nevertheless. “I have lost contact with each of them,” Ms Batamurizi says.

Family formation

Among the perils facing female Alabuga recruits is pregnancy. Media reports, including from Alabuga’s own PR, show that the programme promotes romantic possibilities, and materials include sections on “intercultural marriage” and “family formation.” “Several girls became pregnant during our time there,” Mr Silas says. “The Russian authorities encouraged this, offering additional payments and benefits. But the girls who got pregnant couldn’t leave, even when they wanted to. They became completely dependent on the system.”

Vulnerability

Understanding why young East Africans are vulnerable to these recruitment schemes, including what appear to be broader demographic goals on the part of Russia, requires examining the region’s economic realities. Youth unemployment across the Great Lakes region averages over 60 per cent, with limited opportunities for advancement even for university graduates. Russia’s recruitment drive explicitly targets this desperation. Application materials reviewed by ZAM ask detailed questions about family financial situations, employment history, and future goals. Recruiters appear to prioritise applicants from rural areas with limited educational opportunities and strong financial motivations. Mr Peter confirms that, in his experience, Russia is not “randomly selecting people.” “They choose people who are desperate enough to take risks but smart enough to be useful. People with families to support, people facing limited futures at home.”

He fully understands why people like himself might flock to Russia, even when they know or suspect they may end up in the military. “When your family is struggling to eat, and someone offers you $800 a month plus free housing, you don’t ask many questions.” He believes that “many of those who go there know what may await them, but choose to lie to their friends and parents, saying they’re going to school. The money is too good to pass up, even if it means risking your life, considering the life we live here in Burundi.”

Orders from above

Among the few African state functionaries who have expressed concern about the fate of her country’s youth in the Russian war machine is Uwimana*, a senior education official in Kigali, the capital of authoritarian-ruled Rwanda. Speaking on condition of anonymity, Uwimana told ZAM, “We’ve seen a significant increase in young people expressing interest in Russian educational opportunities. But we are concerned about the vague nature of many of these programmes and the fact that some students who left have simply vanished from communication.”

When asked how the department can allow this to continue, she added: “Baker, you know how things work here; even I can’t dare ask anyone or hold anyone accountable… This also applies to the whole ministry, because sometimes the decisions or discussions with these programmes are beyond our capacity to handle—the orders to work with these people are always coming from above.” Ms Uwimana says she can only wish for “truth and transparency,” and for “governments [to] publicly acknowledge what’s happening, warn citizens about deceptive recruitment practices, and establish systems to monitor and assist their nationals abroad.”

Besides emphasising the need for better governance of African leaders, Ms Uwimana also believes that international pressure on Russia to end deceptive recruitment practices is essential. “This is a form of human trafficking that violates international law. The international community has tools to address this, but it requires political will and coordinated action.” A doctor, Rodrigue Ndabashinze, in Burundi, concurs: “Educational institutions and civil society organisations have roles to play in raising awareness and providing alternatives to vulnerable youth. We also need to address the underlying economic desperation that makes these schemes attractive.”

The Rwanda Investigation Bureau, the main body responsible for criminal investigations in the country, including human trafficking, did not respond to repeated requests regarding Russian recruitment activities.

Friendly Africa

While the Alabuga programme focuses on drone production, it represents just one element of a broader military recruitment effort. The total number of African recruits in Russia’s army is thought to exceed 35,000. According to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, 3,344 foreign nationals who went to fight in Ukraine have received Russian citizenship since the start of 2024.

The military recruitment fits within the broader context of Moscow’s expanding influence across the continent. The Wagner Group’s activities in the Central African Republic, Mali, and other West African nations have established Russian military and political footholds, which now exist throughout Africa. The recruitment programmes also serve domestic Russian needs. With military losses mounting in Ukraine and domestic resistance to mobilisation growing, foreign recruits from what Russia terms “friendly countries” provide a politically acceptable source of manpower.

Meanwhile, hundreds of young people remain trapped in various stages of the Russian recruitment pipeline. Some assemble weapons in Alabuga factories, others undergo military training in Rostov-on-Don, and still others dodge artillery fire in Ukrainian trenches. Mr Silas and others ZAM spoke to all want the international community to act. “Every day we delay action, more families lose their children to this system,” warns Mr Silas. “I was lucky to escape, but so many others won’t be.”

Letters asking the embassies of Burundi and Rwanda if they were in touch with their nationals at Alabuga, or whether they were monitoring their safety and well-being, were left unanswered. A request for comment to the Ugandan ambassador to Russia, Thomas Kizige, and a letter to the Kenyan embassy in Moscow were not responded to.

This article was first published by ZAM Magazine, a PREMIUM TIMES partners. PREMIUM TIMES took part in this transnational investigation, and the Nigerian report will be published soon.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/investigationspecial-reports/819561-investigation-russias-alabuga-scandal-in-the-great-lakes-caught-in-the-snow.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Migrant Battalion: African govts complicit in Russian recruitment of young women into its arms industry,"Late last year, the world was alerted to the disturbing news that Russia was recruiting hundreds of young African women, aged 18–22, to manufacture drones in a military-industrial compound 1,000 km east of Moscow, called the Alabuga Special Economic Zone. The reports also stated that the recruits—from at least fifteen African countries—were promised good salaries and skills training, but once there, they were often trapped, facing tax deductions, dangerous working conditions, strict surveillance, and difficulties returning home.

In the past six months, a team from ZAM and NAIRE in seven African countries investigated the Russian recruitment exercise, asking why so many young Africans take the chance to go, sometimes even after being warned.

A “hundred more this year”

Among the shocking findings of this transnational investigation, launched today, is the involvement of high-ranking government officials in six of the seven countries—and the tacit approval in all seven—in sending their countries’ young women abroad. In Cameroon, a ruling party VIP and member of the Cameroon-Russia Business Council has actively taken 13 recruits to Alabuga and reportedly plans to supply Russia with “a hundred more this year.” A Kenyan and a Nigerian ambassador have been promoting the initiative on-site in Moscow and at Alabuga itself. In Rwanda, “orders from above” have allowed female students to travel to Russia “for vague purposes.”

The Ugandan embassy and a parliamentarian have actively accompanied a contingent of recruits, making them among the first to arrive at Alabuga. The Nigerian Ministry of Education advertises the scholarship opportunity on its official website. Meanwhile, the Malawi Foreign and Labour Ministries, while stressing that there is no formal “labour export agreement” with Russia, allow recruitment through “unofficial means,” and Zambia, despite repeated inquiries, maintains a staunch silence regarding the fate of its youth.

A set of interviews with parents of recruits, additionally done for ZAM in Zimbabwe in cooperation with Deutsche Welle, confirmed that government officials there had also pushed recruitment for Alabuga. The news site Bloomberg reported similar recruitment by politically connected individuals in South Africa (see box).

Pictures on the website of Alabuga itself furthermore showed recruitment actions, including visits to Alabuga, by the Minister of Social Affairs in the DRC, as well as by ambassadors of Somalia, Angola, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, and Mali.

Prickly yoghurt

On 10 October 2024, the Associated Press rocked the public sphere in many African and Western countries by publishing a report that said young African women were working in a drone plant within the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, east of Moscow. It added that these recruits were assembling Iranian Shahed-136 attack drones to be used in Russia’s war in Ukraine and that they used chemicals to paint the drones.

According to the report, one worker told AP they were coating the drones with a caustic “substance with the consistency of yoghurt,” and that the chemicals “made her face feel like it was being pricked with tiny needles,” with “small holes” appearing on her cheeks, which itched. “My God, I could scratch myself! I could never get tired of scratching myself,” AP quoted her as saying. A video shared with AP showed another woman wearing an Alabuga uniform with her face similarly affected.

“The company is all about making drones. I regret and curse the day I started making all those things,” the interviewed woman was quoted as saying. AP added that, according to experts, about 90 per cent of the foreign women recruited via the Alabuga Start programme work on making drones, particularly the parts “that don’t require much skill.”

Tightly controlled

The experts quoted by AP are connected to the Washington, US-based Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS). In a separate report, ISIS revealed that “in some leaked (Alabuga) documents from 2023, [some workers] were called ‘mulattoes’ (…) and that ‘the modules where they worked were labelled with an additional “M,” or “MM,” for “mulatto module,” which were “the most technologically simple portions of airframe production.’” They also said the same Alabuga documents showed that “the participants of this program had fewer opportunities to advance from their assigned module.” In line with ZAM findings, both AP and ISIS found that women at the compound were monitored and that entry to facilities was strictly controlled.

More recently, ISIS has reported that “high-resolution satellite imagery of the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in mid-July 2025 reveals a vast expansion comprising hundreds of new residential buildings and a dozen new production facilities, including workshops, warehouses, and office buildings. (…) The hundreds of new residential buildings, when finished, could hold roughly 41,000 workers.”

Slick PR

A major tool for recruitment is a barrage of slick propaganda on Telegram, Facebook, and other social media channels, ranging from purported testimonials by enthusiastic participants, sometimes in school uniforms (there are no accounts of girls actually attending school in Alabuga), to orchestrated talks and interviews on YouTube. Positive “testimonials” have also been distributed through widely read news media in African countries, some of which have published them uncritically. A warning posted by a prospective recruit, who had shared international reports about drone manufacturing at Alabuga on the dedicated registration Telegram channel in Nigeria, was immediately removed.

“Sergeant Maya”

Perusing the Alabuga account on X, @sezalabuga, the ZAM team came across a tutorial—in the often-used form of a comic strip—which portrayed an unhappy African-looking girl who kept to herself and was only interested, as the thought bubble above her head said, in “sending money home.” Further in the story, she was admonished by a “Sergeant Maya,” who was in uniform and also black. “Sergeant Maya” gently coaxed the stubborn girl to embrace her new home, new family, and new friends.

We saved the Tweet, since “Sergeant Maya” was evidence that, despite Russia’s denials, Alabuga was a military-style environment. Secondly, the content pointed to a broader demographic goal we had also seen elsewhere: Russia appeared to be interested in attracting young women generally, and for more than just a two-year work arrangement. We discussed the findings at a team meeting.

And then the tweet disappeared. Under the URL, there was now only a message from X saying that “the page does not exist.” The Alabuga X account, instead, showed an altered comic strip, with the same girl as in the previous version, but this time she was only moody, no longer thinking about sending money home. In the new story, “Sergeant Maya” had been replaced by ‘HR’ (human resources) Maya, who was white and in civilian dress. The ending was the same: the girl shaped up and became great friends with her new Russian-based family.

Remarkably, the features that changed in the comic were the exact points previously highlighted by our editorial team in internal discussions.

Chillingly, the African governments in this story project generally appeared to actively support what has been called the “farming out” of their youth to jobs abroad, no matter how dodgy, and not only to Russia. The ZAM team notes that in Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Uganda (and elsewhere in Africa), job agencies, often with government approval or with the active involvement of officials, have recruited young women into abusive domestic worker jobs in Gulf States, or youth generally into agricultural labour and security jobs in Israel.

Illustrating the attitude, Malawi Finance Minister Simplex Banda reported in February last year that the “labour export” to Israel from his country had already “generated $735,000”. Less than a year later, his colleague, then Labour Minister, Vitumbiko Mumba, would admonish Malawian workers in Israel—who had complained about harsh conditions and abuse—for not fulfilling their job requirements, saying, inter alia, that they had “abandoned posts, engaged in unauthorised vending and seeking asylum as gays,” and that this was causing Malawi to be “less marketable to the Israeli government.”

Save for Botswana, where the Interpol office was recently reported as stating it was looking into Alabuga recruitment in the country, and South Africa, which promised to look into the matter, none of the governments in this investigation have publicly expressed concern about young citizens now living at a drone manufacturing site; not even after the compound was targeted by Ukrainian drone attacks on 2 April 2024 and again in April and May 2025. None of the governments in the seven countries responded to letters asking to facilitate contact with the recruits or whether they were concerned for their safety.

Trafficking station

While driving away their own youth, some of the governments in this investigation have also engaged in deals with the West to accommodate unwanted migrants from elsewhere, even Palestinians chased from Gaza. Ugandan sources told the team that the country is turning into a trafficking station, sending its own young adults abroad while offering itself to the US as a ‘dumping ground’ for unwanted humans from there.

South Africa

Late in August, a Bloomberg investigation in South Africa revealed that the BRICS Women’s Business Alliance in that country—which says it operates under the mandate of the national Women’s Ministry—had signed an agreement to supply Russia with 5,600 workers next year, including to Alabuga. In a comment, the Women’s Ministry denied being “formally linked” to the recruiting organisation but said it “was aware” of it. The BRICS Student Alliance in the same country has also advertised Alabuga jobs, together with some high-profile influencers. The Department of International Relations and Cooperation said it was investigating but added that the “South African government is yet to find credible evidence that job offers in Russia are inconsistent with their stated purpose.”

The 947 radio channel reported that it had phoned office numbers in Alabuga for clarity, but not one of several calls was answered.

Boys go for US$1000

The team also found that there was—at least for young male Alabuga recruits, three of whom were interviewed—an overlap between the Alabuga project and the frontlines of the war in Ukraine. Two young men from Burundi, who had initially been put to work in the drone factory, found themselves coerced and obliged to go to war. A Ugandan politician who acted as a recruiter said that “boys,” wherever they were in Russia, were at great risk of being recruited into the war because “the posters are everywhere,” and that was why Uganda preferred “that they take the girls.”

African students in other parts of Russia reported having received offers to find compatriots to enlist in the Russian army, with one sending a screenshot showing “US$1000 per Malawian.” Military recruits from a wide range of African countries have been identified in online reports and photographs wearing Russian uniforms.

Women were encouraged to establish relationships

Regarding the young women —which perhaps explains the mysterious age limit of 22—the team was able to confirm reports, including from Alabuga PR itself, that girls were encouraged to establish “love” relationships with fellow workers at Alabuga and in Russia generally. One Alabuga recruit from Burundi told the team that “several girls got pregnant” during his time working there.

Savings under “sanctions”

The ZAM team interviewed one recruit who is presently residing in a dorm room at Alabuga. She said that the site was “very large, with many industries” and that her colleagues worked there in various jobs, not only on drones. However, she also said that the workers were subject to heavy security, were not allowed to wander freely, and had ID cards that restricted them to limited areas. There was a very “strict workplace culture” that many were “unable to cope” with. “A lot of them have gone back,” she said, adding that she herself wanted to return after fulfilling her two-year term but was concerned she might not be able to bring back her savings “because of sanctions.”

In a series of seven stories, ZAM and the ZAIRE team portray the Alabuga schemes’ manifestations in the Great Lakes region (focusing on Burundi and Rwanda), Zambia, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, Malawi, and Cameroon.

"INVESTIGATION: Agrochemicals are endangering lives, environment in Nigerian communities","When Monday Nweze left for his farmland on a cloudy Tuesday in late June, he had one thing in mind: to clear the grass that had grown on it. Not with any cutlass, but with some litres of uproot, a type of herbicide, he poured into his sprayer.

The farmer was engrossed as he sprayed the herbicide on his bushy land where he planned to cultivate rice in Ndiebor community in Ezza Inyimagu, Izzi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, south-east Nigeria.

Aside from the sprayer strapped to his back, Mr Nweze did not put on any personal protective equipment (PPE) – not even a nose or face mask. Spraying herbicides and other agrochemicals without PPE has become a routine for him and many other farmers in the community.

Like others, Mr Nweze uses various pesticides and other agrochemicals to either control weeds or insects on his farmlands, which measure over two hectares.

But he puts his life and the environment at risk. The farmer, too, is aware of the steep cost of his actions. In 2012, he suffered pesticide poisoning during application.

“I battled for my life. I was growing very weak daily and then hospitalised,” he recalled. “It was later that they (doctors) advised me that I should cover my nose and body (when using agrochemicals).”

When asked why he was not using protective covering despite his earlier experience, Mr Nweze claimed that the agrochemicals produced these days are not as effective as the ones before, and that his body had adjusted to their effect.

“Before now, if I am spraying the chemicals here, if the breeze pushes them to the other side of the land, it will affect the crops there,” he told PREMIUM TIMES, pointing at a nearby farmland.

“But, I still take medicine after spraying (to reduce the effect on my health). After spraying the chemicals, I often suffer from catarrh, which sometimes results in malaria.

“These agrochemicals we are using are not good. And that’s why organisms like earthworms, you can’t see it – they are killed by the chemicals. You know earthworms soften the soil. It has agricultural importance,” Mr Nweze said.

Why agrochemicals despite health risks

Mr Nweze said that despite understanding the risks involved in the use of agrochemicals, he and others are compelled to rely on them because of the enormous costs involved in deploying better alternatives to clear the weeds.

“Now, to clear a portion of land, they (labourers) would ask for N14,000. But if you buy a litre of this chemical at N1,500, you can use it to spray everywhere. That’s why many are even cultivating rice here. Before now, it used to be only for the rich,” he said.

The farmer admitted that organic farming is better and is a natural method of pest control, which also helps soil fertility, but regretted that land scarcity forced many to abandon it.

Organic farming is a system that relies on natural processes such as the use of green manure and the practice of crop rotation and shifting cultivation to maintain soil health rather than using synthetic fertilisers and agrochemicals.

“Before, we (used to) practice shifting cultivation. But right now, we don’t do it because of the scarcity of land,” Mr Nweze said.

‘Sweet poison’

Many Nigerian farmers rely on agrochemicals to fight pests and control weeds for improved crop productivity because they believe the chemicals make farming cheaper and faster. But not many of them are aware that the use of these chemicals harms the environment, including humans, animals and plants.

Both local and international studies have shown that exposure to pesticides and other agrochemicals is a major cause of cancer, cardiovascular disease, dermatitis, birth defects, morbidity, impaired immune function, neurobehavioral disorder and allergy sensitisation reaction. One study even linked exposure to agricultural pesticides to Parkinson’s disease.

“Agrochemical poisoning can lead to death,” Tanimola Akande, a public health expert, told PREMIUM TIMES in July.

Farmers, farm workers, and their families in agrarian communities experience highest pesticide exposure, which puts them in high risk of cancer, birth defects, autism and other diseases, according to the Pesticides Action Network, a coalition of over 600 NGOs and individuals in over 90 countries, including Nigeria, working to replace the use of hazardous pesticides with ecologically socially just alternatives.

Data on the number of deaths linked to the use of agrochemicals in Nigeria are unavailable. But in 2020, at least 270 people in Nigeria’s north-central state of Benue were reported in local media to have died due to pesticide poisoning from a contaminated river.

Similarly, a report by Alliance for Action on Pesticide in Nigeria (AAPN) and Small-scale Women Farmers Organisation in Nigeria (SWOFON) on farm chemical poisoning from 2008 to 2022 showed 24 incidents across the country that resulted in 454 deaths, including pregnant women and children.

Globally, pesticide poisoning kills 220,000 people annually, mostly in developing countries, out of at least three million cases of pesticide poisoning, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).

‘Helpful and harmful’

For Ogochukwu Mbam, another Nigerian farmer who cultivates rice and cassava in Ndiebor Community, agrochemicals are both helpful and harmful. Unlike many farmers, Mr Mbam uses PPE, but he still suffers from nasal obstruction whenever he uses agrochemicals on his farmlands.

“While spraying (the chemicals), you will certainly get nasal obstruction. There is no way you will go for agrochemicals (without getting) nasal obstruction. It weakens the body. Most times, after inhaling those agrochemicals, it must affect you,” said the 29-year-old whose farmlands measure more than four hectares.

Apart from health impacts, Mr Mbam, who began using agrochemicals four years ago, also suffers from another adverse effect of agrochemicals: low crop yields.

“It helps in controlling the pests and even the weeds… but it is both helpful and harmful,” he said.

“It has been affecting me because it reduces the nutrients in farmlands. Before we started using agrochemicals, we usually used cutlasses to cut grass, pack it outside and then cultivate the land.

“You can’t compare the nutrients in the farmlands now and the nutrients available in farmlands when we were not using agrochemicals,” the farmer added, suggesting that crops yield better without agrochemicals.

While conceding that organic farming is safer and helps crop yields, Mr Mbah blamed the scarcity of labourers and high labour costs for his reliance on agrochemicals.

“Organic farming method is preferable health-wise, both for the crops and the farmer himself. One is that agrochemicals affect our health. Most times, it is because there is no worker who can help; that’s why we go for those agrochemicals,” he said.

Mass deaths

Ngozi Uguru is a cassava and yam farmer in Abofia-Mgbo Agbaja, another community in Ndiachi, Izzi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State. Each time she sprays pesticides and other agrochemicals on her farm, Mrs Uguru suffers adverse health reactions. She does not use any PPE.

“My whole body usually hurts me like I sprinkled pepper on (my) skin,” Mrs Uguru said, in Igbo language, demonstrating with her hands. Like most farmers in the local area, she relies on herbal medicines to “stabilise” her health.

However, before starting to use pesticides, the mother of four did not know that exposure to pesticides and other agrochemicals was harmful to human health and the environment, including crops.

PREMIUM TIMES asked the 36-year-old if anyone had fallen ill in the area in the past because of exposure to agrochemicals.

“The year when people started using agrochemicals newly around here, someone sprayed it on his farmland, and the wife used vegetables harvested from the same farmland to cook, it killed many, and some survived too,” Friday Uguru, her husband’s brother, responded.

Mr Uguru, a small-scale farmer, said the mass deaths happened in a village in Ezea Inyimagu between 2012 and 2013.

“That was when I suspected that agrochemicals are poisonous,” he stated.

The farmer would later discover that agrochemicals are also harmful to crops and the environment after he observed that some “beneficial organisms”, such as centipedes and earthworms, died off in his farmlands after spraying the agrochemicals.

“And some of these insects are helping to soften the soil, but they are not available (anymore) in farmlands around here,” he said.

Chijioke Agbo began using agrochemicals more than four years ago to reduce the cost of weeding and ward off monkeys attacking his farmlands in Obeagu Awkunanaw Community in Enugu Council Area of Enugu State.

Rated by residents as the farmer with the largest farm in the community, the father of four boasts of farmlands measuring over three hectares where he farms yams, cassava, cocoyam, maize and vegetables.

Like others, he has not contemplated ditching agrochemicals and synthetic fertilisers, despite knowing the health risks.

“For over five years now, I haven’t contracted labourers to weed or clear my farmlands. I use agrochemicals to control weeds and pests,” Mr Agbo said boastfully. The farmer quickly dashed into his store and came out with a carton of various agrochemicals, including liquid fertilisers.

But he, too, has been experiencing some health challenges due to exposure to the agrochemicals. “Each time I apply the chemicals on my farmlands, I usually suffer heavy itching for three or four days because the breeze often pushes the chemicals onto my body,” he lamented.

The farmer said he usually rubs palm oil and vaseline on the affected part of his body, but that it does not stop the itching. He has no PPE.

Asked why he still uses agrochemicals despite the danger to his health, he cited the high cost of labour for weeding his farmlands and the attacks by monkeys and other pests.

Unlike Mr Agbo, Chioma Oje, another farmer in the community, applies pesticides on her cassava and vegetable farmlands but has yet to suffer any adverse effect on her health.

But Mr Akande, a professor of public health at the University of Ilorin, explained to PREMIUM TIMES that agrochemical poisoning can lead to death either “immediately or kill slowly” depending on the type, quantity and frequency of exposure to the chemicals.

“I learnt that if one sprays pesticides on crops, the person should wait for some time before harvesting the crops,” Mrs Oje recalled, admitting that exposure to agrochemicals poses health risks.

In the course of this investigation, this reporter, in July, visited Okwadike Care Hospital, a health facility in the community, to ascertain if the facility had diagnosed medical conditions linked to agrochemical exposure.

Nkechi Okolie, a medical laboratory scientist in the hospital, told PREMIUM TIMES that multiple test results show that apart from malaria and typhoid, liver and kidney failures are dominant issues suffered by farmers who visit the treatment facility.

Ms Okolie said that high exposure to certain agrochemicals can lead to kidney damage and liver inflammation.

“I can’t really say if their conditions were caused by exposure to agrochemicals. But after running the tests, I noticed that their kidneys have high creatinine levels in the blood, indicating kidney problems,” she said.

From biodiversity to chemical accumulation in food crops

Apart from the risks posed to human health, agrochemicals are dangerous to biodiversity, which is important for crop productivity, experts say.

“One of the key implications the use of these pesticides and other agrochemicals has is the destruction of biodiversity,” Joyce Brown, an agroforestry expert, told PREMIUM TIMES.

“Pesticides and other agrochemicals not only destroy the target weeds and pests, they also destroy beneficial microorganisms, which are mostly responsible for the health of these soils and productivity,” said Ms Brown, the director of programmes at Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF), a Nigeria-based organisation advocating for environmental and climate justice and food sovereignty in Africa.

But the destruction is not limited to biodiversity. Yakubu Uwaidem, a crop protectionist, says agrochemicals absorbed by crops during application on farmlands can affect human health.

“Plants have the ability to harbour heavy metals and components that they will not use,” Mr Uwaidem explained. “So, plants harbour every component of these chemicals and use only the ones they need, while the ones they don’t need will remain in their system. It is the end users, that’s the consumers of the crops, that will be taking those things into their system.”

A 2021 study conducted in Osun State, south-west Nigeria, by six researchers across universities in Africa, found that crops readily absorbed harmful pesticides, which endanger the lives of those who consume food items.

Mr Uwaidem stressed that Nigerian farmers lack knowledge of proper agrochemical application, noting that the type of target pests, plants and dosage are central in choosing the application method and timing for better results.

Between organic farming and inorganic farming

Years ago, Damian Edeh, a small-scale farmer in Amankpaka Nike, Enugu East Council Area of Enugu State, began using animal faeces, mainly pig dung, on his farmlands.

Mr Edeh, an engineer and the traditional ruler of the community, detests agrochemicals like a plague. He had learnt through research and interactions with medical experts that agrochemicals are harmful to health and the environment.

“I have a modest farmland, not too large, but the yields are huge, even better than yields from farmlands of those who use agrochemicals,” he said, dismissing the claim that agrochemicals are better in improving crop yields.

“I don’t use agrochemicals on my farmlands because I know they cause cancer. I depend on the farmland for my food. I don’t buy food items in the market.”

The traditional ruler, concerned about the health of his family, exports food items harvested from his farm to his children who are based outside Nigeria.

For Jude Eze, another farmer in the neighbouring Ugwogo-Nike Community, agrochemicals “make farming easier” and reduce labour costs. He said that, although he uses agrochemicals, crops harvested from farmlands where chemicals are not used are better off.

“For instance, if you harvest cassava from farmland where they did not apply agrochemicals, after fermentation, the cassava tubers would yield more than those from farmlands where they applied agrochemicals,” he explained in Igbo language.

Nigeria is a dumping ground for EU-banned agrochemicals

The European Union (EU) has banned the use of some pesticides across Europe after they were found to cause severe damage to human health and the environment. The EU, however, faces criticism for allowing companies to manufacture these hazardous pesticides in the EU for export to other countries with weak regulations.

Consequently, like other low-income countries, Nigeria has become a dumping ground for the Europe-based agrochemical companies exporting banned toxic pesticides.

In 2018 alone, more than 81,000 tonnes of pesticides containing EU-banned hazardous chemicals were exported to low-income countries like Nigeria, according to the European Environmental Bureau.

In West Africa, pesticide imports doubled from 218,948 tonnes in 2015 to 437,930 tonnes in 2020. Within the same 2020, Nigeria imported 147,446 tonnes of pesticides, which exceeded the total imports of Southern Africa (87,403 tonnes) and North Africa (109,561 tonnes).

A 2022 study by the German Heinrich Boll Foundation revealed that some EU-banned hazardous pesticides are being used in Nigeria by farmers.

A similar study by the AAPN, in 2021, found that 40 per cent of all the pesticides used in Nigeria had been banned by the EU due to their high toxicity.

About 80 per cent of pesticides used by women in parts of Nigeria’s north-central region belong to the category of Highly Hazardous Pesticides (HHPs). In many instances, such pesticides have lost approval in countries and regions with high safety standards, such as the EU, the AAPN study showed.

The US and European countries have continued to reject food items exported from Nigeria because of the high level of agrochemicals, mainly pesticides, in them.

In Nigeria, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) regulates the production and use of food and drugs, including agrochemicals.

Despite the regulation, however, banned agrochemicals are still in use across the country.

Posing as a buyer, a PREMIUM TIMES reporter found that some agrochemicals, which contain active ingredients banned by NAFDAC and the EU, were on sale in open markets in Enugu and Ebonyi states.

In the Ogbete and Aria markets in Enugu State, for instance, this reporter found Atraz, a type of herbicide, being sold openly in these markets. Atraz contains Atrazine, an active ingredient banned by NAFDAC in 2023.

The chemical was banned by the EU in 2003 after evidence surfaced that it “interferes with reproduction and development, and may cause cancer.”

When contacted in July, Christiana Obiazikwor, a NAFDAC spokesperson, asked this reporter to contact her via WhatsApp.

But Ms Obiazikwor was yet to respond to the enquiry from this reporter several weeks later.

What can be done

To address agrochemical poisoning in Nigeria, authorities must effectively regulate the importation, sale and use of agrochemicals in the country, according to experts.

“There is virtually no regulation on the sales and use of agrochemicals (in Nigeria). It is important to put in regulations and enforce such regulations,” Mr Akande, the Nigerian-based public health expert, said.

For Ms Brown, the agroforestry expert, the Nigerian authorities should immediately ban the use and sale of chemicals in the HHPs category and introduce restrictions on harmful chemicals.

The HOMEF director suggested empowering farmers and agroecologists to produce organic pesticides and fertilisers using readily available raw materials, such as ginger, garlic, and pepper.

“With such pesticides, you’re sure you are not destroying beneficial microorganisms,” she said.

SPECIAL REPORT: Food Inflation worsens child malnutrition crisis in northern Nigeria,"In Awe, a rural community in Nasarawa State, north-central Nigeria, Salamatu Madaki flips through a register in search of the names of malnourished children. It’s the middle of the year, and the numbers in her care as the local government’s nutrition coordinator tell a story she wishes she could rewrite before the year ends.

“We feed our children three times a day, but it’s just carbohydrates,” she told PREMIUM TIMES. “No vegetables, no beans, no meat. Mostly pap in the morning, yams in the afternoon, fufu at night.”

Even those plain meals are becoming unaffordable. Between December 2024 and May 2025, cases of severe acute malnutrition in Awe jumped from 64 to 86. Moderate cases also increased, from 28 to 32, according to Ms Madaki.

Across Nigeria’s northern communities, a crisis is unfolding silently. As food prices rise, families living on the margins are slipping further into poverty. For many, especially children, the result is devastating: acute malnutrition that stunts not just growth, but future potential.

According to UNICEF, Nigeria has the world’s second-highest number of stunted children, with 32 per cent of children under five affected. About two million Nigerian children suffer from severe acute malnutrition (SAM), but only two in 10 receive treatment. Seven per cent of women of childbearing age also suffer from acute malnutrition.

SAM is a serious condition where children do not get enough nutrients and energy to grow and develop properly. It can lead to weakened immunity, making children more vulnerable to infections and even death if untreated.

SAM in Northern Nigeria

There are cases of malnutrition in most parts of Nigeria, but the situation is worse and dire in the northern part of the country.

Over 650 children have died from severe acute malnutrition in Katsina State this year, according to the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).

PREMIUM TIMES reports that the organisation, which has been operating in Katsina since 2021, said it recorded an alarming rise in the number of malnourished children brought to its treatment centres in increasingly critical condition.

In Kano, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said 51.9 per cent of children are stunted due to malnutrition.

In Kebbi, the MSF said it recorded a 74.1 per cent increase in the admission of malnourished children into its facilities between January and June 2025.

A diet of survival

In Nasarawa’s Awe and Niger State’s Maikunkele community, mothers describe a bleak and repetitive diet built on starchy foods. A single egg now costs N250, five times its 2023 price. Cow milk, once a common supplement, has soared from N100 to N500 for a 750ml bottle.

Najahatu Salihu, a mother of two in Awe, became concerned when her nine-month-old daughter couldn’t crawl or sit on her own. Diagnosed with malnutrition, the baby remains on the same carbohydrate-heavy diet, lacking vital nutrients.

“I manage a public tap and get about N500 a day from my brother-in-law,” she told PREMIUM TIMES. “My husband works in the market. There’s no way we can afford meat or milk.”

Hadiza Abdullahi, 38, shares a similar ordeal. Her 14-month-old son stopped attempting to walk at 10 months and was diagnosed with malnutrition.

“We used to buy beans and eggs, but now we eat only rice or maize,” she said. “We cook once at night and reheat it in the morning. It’s the same thing every day.”

In Maikunkele, grain seller Mariam Abdulhadi watches her two-year-old daughter, Fatimo, struggle with persistent feeding problems. Slightly built and often clinging to her mother, the child was born underweight and was not exclusively breastfed.

“She only pinches rice when I eat,” said Ms Abdulhadi. “She vomits most solid foods and lives mostly on breast milk.”

Doctors had recommended a diet of nutrient-rich foods, such as kwash pap, milk, and vegetables. But after a little improvement, the family turned to an herbalist. Even when a health worker suggested adding eggs and fish, her husband dismissed the idea: “So she wants to enjoy when there is no money?” Mrs Abdulhadi remembers her husband saying. Her mother also dismissed the idea with a shake of the head.

“One egg is now N250/N300, and fish is also expensive,” she said. “She is not my only child; business has been bad these days.”

Cut off from help

Despite the growing crisis, many communities like Awe and Maikunkele remain excluded from Nigeria’s Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) programme, cutting them off from interventions by UNICEF and other aid groups.

According to Ms Madaki, the last significant support the Awe LGA received was in 2023, through the ANRIN project. In May 2025, the state delivered a small batch of “kwash pap”, a nutrient-rich porridge made from soybeans, groundnuts, and millet, commonly known as Tom Brown.

But the support is sporadic and far from sufficient.

Mercy Madumbi, the local nutrition officer in Maikunkele, said the state nutrition office occasionally sends supplies, but they rarely meet local needs.

“Most women are unemployed,” she said. “Even when food is available, they can’t afford it, and they don’t know how to combine what they have for better nutrition.”

Yakubu Maaji, ward focal person for Maikunkele, warns that rising food prices are affecting children and pregnant women.

“Some babies are born malnourished because their mothers were not well-fed during pregnancy,” he said. “It’s transferred from mother to child.”

Three years ago, Mr Maaji said, 98 per cent of children in the community were well nourished. That figure has now dropped to 60 per cent, leaving 40 per cent malnourished.

As of 2024, Niger State recorded 3,570 reported cases of malnutrition among children under five, according to State Nutrition Officer, Asmau Muhammad.

She called for urgent government and donor funding, expansion of the Integrated Management of Acute Malnutrition (IMAM) programme, and the upgrade of primary healthcare centres with solar power, clean water, and essential supplies like MUAC tapes and Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF).

She also stressed the need to engage traditional leaders, promote peer support groups, and use local-language radio to improve awareness of exclusive breastfeeding and proper child feeding.

Nutrition experts say the crisis begins before birth.

“If the mother has not stocked up enough nutrients, then the child will not get enough. Limbs, organs, and even brain development are affected by a lack of nutrients when the child is still a fetus,” Marylyne Malomba, a nutrition consultant for the International Medical Corps, said.

“So it’s important to understand that the health of the mother at the point of pregnancy is one of the most important places to start taking care of the child.”

Too poor to feed

In Maikunkele, Hasanna Isah tries to soothe her hungry two-year-old son in their dim, poorly ventilated room. He had just started crawling the previous week.

“He was born weak and underweight, not in a hospital,” she said.

Ms Isah tried to breastfeed exclusively but fell ill soon after delivery. Her skin began peeling, prompting a visit to a leprosy hospital. She switched to baby formula, but one tin costs N6,000 and lasts only three days. Now, she feeds him plain pap with no sugar and supplements it with Peak milk sachets when she can afford them.

“One sachet is N200 and I can stretch it for two feedings,” she said. “But it’s not every time I have the money.”

Separated from her husband, Ms Isah lives with her mother and three children. Her mother survives on small remittances from children who earn very little.

“We eat tuwo with dry okra or baobab soup,” she said. “Meat is out of reach. I sometimes buy N100 fried fish-gangaria, and shred it so it can go round.”

Even vegetables have become a luxury. “One bunch is N200, and it’s not enough for my children. Sometimes that’s all the money I have.”

In the dry season, a poor water supply makes home gardening nearly impossible.

“During that period, even getting water to drink or bathe is hard,” said Mr Maaji. “We only manage to plant during the rainy season.”

The inflation effect

Nigeria is facing its worst inflation crisis in decades. Headline inflation peaked at 34.8 per cent in December 2024 before the National Bureau of Statistics rebased its Consumer Price Index. The new basket lowered the figure to 24.48 per cent in January, but food inflation has remained high.

By June, the country’s annual inflation stood at 22.22 per cent, with food inflation reaching 21.97 per cent year-on-year.

Rising prices have forced many farms and businesses to shut down. Insecurity and erratic weather have also reduced food production.

In July 2023, President Bola Tinubu declared a state of emergency regarding food insecurity. However, the situation has only worsened.

According to the SBM Jollof Index, the cost of cooking a pot of jollof rice rose 19 per cent between September 2024 and March 2025, from N21,300 to N25,486.

The report, Staple Under Stress, attributed the rise to soaring prices of ingredients like pepper, onions, rice, turkey, and beef. Protein remains the most expensive element: turkey now costs between N12,000 and N14,000 per kilo, up from N1,500–N1,700 in 2016. Beef has doubled to N7,000–N7,500 per kilo, goat meat is N6,500–N7,000, while Titus fish sells for around N7,000 per kilo.

Grains have also tripled. A cup of guinea corn now sells for N3,000, up from N1,500 in 2023. Soybeans have tripled. Vegetables like spinach or kuka leaves cost N200 a bunch, barely enough for one meal.

In Gosa Market, Abuja, vegetable seller Munachisom Favour put it plainly: “We eat without meat or fish. I can’t afford to give my children what they need.”

Policy gaps and uncertain funding

In the 2024 Global Hunger Index, Nigeria is ranked 110th out of 127 countries with enough data to calculate the scores. With a score of 28.8, Nigeria faces a serious level of hunger.

Nigeria ranked 107th out of 113 countries on the 2022 Global Food Security Index and 25th out of 28 in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Economist Intelligence Unit noted that Nigeria scored 0.0 on policy commitments for food security and access, compared to a global average of 47.1.

In response to the crisis, the Nigerian government proposed a 33.7 per cent increase in the 2025 nutrition budget, from N127.24 billion in 2024 to N170.01 billion, bringing the total allocation to N243 billion. That marks a 746 per cent rise from the N10.8 billion spent in 2021.

But despite these figures, hunger persists. More than 35 million children remain trapped in cycles of stunting, wasting, and underweight.

The Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) shows that child nutrition has worsened in the past five years. In 2018, 37 per cent of children under five were stunted. By 2023, it rose to 40 per cent. Underweight cases climbed from 22 to 27 per cent, while wasting increased from 7 to 8 per cent.

In Niger State, the stunting rate increased from 28.2 per cent in 2018 to 43.9 per cent in 2023/24. Nasarawa saw a rise from 31.2 to 35 per cent.

Civil Society Scaling Up Nutrition in Nigeria (CS-SUNN) said these figures show a worsening trend even in states with minor changes. Population growth has masked any real improvement.

The group continues to advocate for stronger policies, improved budget releases, and better access to RUTF. It has also pushed for a six-month paid maternity leave bill and the completion of Nigeria’s revised nutrition policy.

In February 2025, the federal government launched the N774 Initiative to give local governments more control over nutrition efforts. However, experts remain cautious about how much funding will be released and how effectively it will be spent.

“The future is stunted”

Without urgent and scaled-up intervention, there are concerns that Nigeria risks irreversible damage to its youngest generation.

“Malnutrition doesn’t just stunt the body,” said Ms Madumbi. “It stunts the mind, the immune system, the future.”

Every hour, nearly 100 Nigerian children under five die from malnutrition or related illnesses, according to UNICEF.

The International Rescue Committee (IRC) recently raised alarm over the growing number of severely malnourished children in its clinics across Northern Nigeria. The crisis is expected to worsen during the lean season, as insecurity, aid cuts, climate shocks, and severe flooding deepen food scarcity.

“Children are especially vulnerable during this period,” said Babatunde Ojei, Country Director, IRC Nigeria. “It’s heartbreaking to see the needs growing while support shrinks. Violence and insecurity are cutting off communities, leaving children without the care they desperately need.”

Paul Alaje, senior economist at SPM Professionals, argues that inflation is a major factor driving malnutrition in Nigeria because the rising cost of food has placed basic nutrition out of reach for many households.

He noted that more than 40 per cent of the population lives on very low or fixed incomes, making it difficult for them to afford the foods necessary for healthy living.

According to him, no amount of medication or nutritional supplements can adequately address malnutrition without access to actual food.

He explained that unless inflation drops to single digits and people have more purchasing power, families will continue to struggle with food insecurity, and the nutrition crisis will persist.

“Inflation is one of the major contributors to household malnutrition. Food costs have become unreachable for low-income families, who comprise over 40 per cent of our population. Nutrition cannot rely on supplements alone. Without access to real food, families will continue to suffer,” he said.

Fields of Fear: Militia attacks in Benue force women off farmlands,"“Every morning, I pray to God that I won’t give birth at the hospital, because I won’t be able to pay the hospital bill,” says Terguhe Akpaku as she wipes mucus from the nose of one of her twin children.

Mrs Akpaku is pregnant with her ninth child. Normally, by this time, she would either be working on her cassava farm in Tse-Vinde, a community in Ukum, Benue State, with her fingers deep in the red earth, or transporting her produce to the market in Zaki-Biam to sell. But since armed men invaded her community in January, in an attack she said left more than fifty people dead, Mrs Akpaku hasn’t returned.

“It was a Tuesday morning. I had just bathed my children and was pushing a wheelbarrow to go sell akamu when I heard gunshots,” she recalls. “They burned my farm and killed about eight people in my compound.”

“I still hear gunshots in my dreams,” she adds. “And now I’ve lost everything.”

Mrs Akpaku is one of thousands of women farmers in Benue whose lives and livelihoods have been shattered by a wave of violent attacks sweeping through farming communities in Benue and other states across Nigeria’s north-central region.

In Benue, Nigeria’s food basket, at least 17 of its 23 local government areas have reported incidents of armed militias raiding villages, burning farms, and driving residents into displacement camps. According to the International Organisation for Migration, as of January 2025, the documented number of internally displaced persons stood at 210,876 persons from 54,476 households across 14 local government areas, with 56 per cent of them women.

Mchivir Terkende, one of such women, remembers the morning of 5 March 2024, in Tyoluv in Ukum. “It started around 3 a.m. We heard gunshots and ran to hide. By 5 a.m., just when we thought it was safe to come out, another round of shooting began,” she narrated.

She, her co-wife, and some of their children crawled on their stomachs through the back of their house into the bush. They waited there for about an hour, then trekked for nearly five hours to Zaki-Biam, where their husband lives.

“We left everything,” she says. “We didn’t take a single thing. It happened so fast. Everything … gone.”

She says she left behind her groundnut harvest, her cassava and water yam farm the size of about five football fields.

Women at the Frontlines

Women are the backbone of subsistence farming in Benue, says Damilola Olajubutu, a rural development and public policy expert. “They handle everything from production to post-harvest processing, and they contribute between 70 to 80 per cent of agricultural labour.”

Paradoxically, despite their role, most rural women receive little to no recognition or support. “They lack access to resources, financial empowerment, and land ownership. Only about 10 per cent of landowners in rural areas are women,” Ms Olajubutu, who is also the executive director of Rural Nurture Initiative, notes.

Basil Abia, a policy analyst and co-founder of Veriv Africa, a research advisory and business intelligence company that tracks food price and production data across Nigeria, underscores the disproportionate economic impact of these displacements. “In the North-central, especially in Benue, women are central to both food production and processing. When conflict displaces these women, it hits production directly. You’re essentially removing a significant portion of the active farming population.”

He adds that their absence from informal markets destabilises local economies. “Women are also critical in food marketing. They’re the traders and market sellers. So when they’re displaced, you don’t just lose producers—you also lose market actors. This affects supply chains and drives up food prices.”

Benue is one of Nigeria’s agricultural powerhouses, but the rising insecurity is disproportionately affecting women farmers.

“Women are more vulnerable because they don’t have the means or skills to defend themselves,” Ms Olajubutu adds. “When women abandon their livelihoods and flee from violence, it disrupts the entire farming cycle.”

Timing, she explains, is everything in agriculture. “If attacks force women to flee during planting season, it affects what gets harvested. That eventually leads to food shortages.”

Even communities not directly attacked are affected. “The fear alone is enough to keep people from farming.”

Worse still, the toll of the crisis extends beyond the farm.

“When violence erupts, schools close down, and children are forced to stay home,” Ms Olajubutu says. “Women end up shouldering additional caregiving responsibilities, further limiting their ability to engage in farming.”

Impact on Food Prices

Ngizan Chahul, president of the Association of Women Farmers, agrees that the displacement of women farmers has caused significant disruption in local food chains, reduced production, and led to rising food prices. “When demand is high and the product is not available due to the farmers displaced due to insecurity, what do you think will happen?”

Benue State is the largest producer of soybeans, cassava, mangoes, and oranges in the country. The state is also the leading producer of yams and ranks among the top rice producers in Nigeria.

Terkumbu Terzumgwe, a mother of six, was preparing seed yams for planting when her village, Tse-Dajo, in Ukum, was attacked. While she escaped, her husband did not.

“They took us by surprise. They used machetes to cut him, burned our houses, and took all our farm produce. The ones they couldn’t carry, they set on fire.”

She now lives with her brother’s family in Zaki-Biam, too afraid to return to farming, the only work she’s ever known.

The ripple effect is clear in local markets. At the Yam Market in Anyi, Logo Local Government Area of the state, the price of a 100-tuber bundle has more than tripled since 2020, says Msughter Orayo, a shop owner.

“Before the attacks, farmers brought thousands of tubers daily. We’d sell, keep our commission, and give them their share,” he explains. “Now, we barely get any. We have to go and find yams ourselves.”

Mr Orayo says that he used to get between 4,000 and 5,000 tubers daily, but all that has dried up.

Forty-nine-year-old Msughshima Ortamem-Ibo, who once supplied yams to Mr Orayo’s shop but now buys and resells produce, explains why: “Going to the bush to farm is a suicide mission,” she says. “So we’ve all moved to town, and getting land here doesn’t come cheap.”

The crisis is reflected in national data. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, food inflation hit 21.26 per cent nationwide in April 2025.

In Benue, however, it soared to 51.76 per cent, the highest in the country. Experts attribute the spike directly to insecurity that has disrupted farming and displaced thousands of smallholder farmers, many of them women. A recent study by researchers at the Benue State University and the Federal University of Lafia found that a one per cent increase in insecurity leads to a 0.211 per cent decrease in crop output and a 0.311 per cent drop in livestock production, further weakening already fragile food systems.

“As this violence forces women off the farms, we must understand that we are no longer dealing with just a security issue but also a national economic crisis,” says Ms Olajubutu. “We are weakening local food systems by ignoring rural women’s safety.”

She warns that prolonged displacement could trigger intergenerational food insecurity, as children now grow up without agricultural skills or stable nutrition.

Government’s slow response

Despite the scale and frequency of attacks, residents say government response has been painfully slow or nonexistent. “We feel left alone, like no one cares,” Mrs Terzumgwe says.

For over a month, between June and the first week of July, efforts to reach James Iorpuu, head of the Benue State Emergency Management Agency, were unsuccessful. Calls to his phone went unanswered, and a text message sent to his number received no response. Similarly, attempts to contact the State Ministry of Agriculture yielded no results. During a visit to the ministry, a staff member asked this reporter to return on another day. But when the reporter returned as advised, he was informed that the commissioner had not yet resumed work and that his date of return was uncertain.

On 30 July, Benue State Governor Hyacinth Alia dissolved the State Executive Council (SEC), rendering all efforts to seek official response from appointees futile.

However, Mr Alia has blamed the violence on foreigners, describing the attackers as land-grabbers.

“We are under siege as a state. We are under attack, and those who are attacking us are land-grabbers. They displace our people,” Mr Alia says.

Following reports that about 150 people were killed in Daudu, near Makurdi, the governor claimed some progress in fighting back: “Seventeen local governments were under attack. We fought it down to nine local governments. We fought it down to six local governments. Now we have fought it down to three local governments.”

The attackers are often believed to be armed Fulani militia who seek to ensure Fulani herders have unrestrained access to arable grazing land in the state, which brings them into conflict with sedentary farming communities. Although such violence has been ongoing in Benue and many other Nigerian communities for decades, the effects of climate change, such as desertification in the far north, mean more migrant herders (often Fulani) are grazing their cattle into communities in the north-central like Benue.

While Mr Alia sees the attackers as foreign land-grabbers who should be treated as criminals, President Bola Tinubu believes negotiations will bring about peace in the state.

PREMIUM TIMES reported that Mr Tinubu, during his visit to Benue in June, following another attack, advised Mr Alia to set up a peace committee in the state.

“Let us meet again in Abuja. Let’s fashion out a framework for lasting peace. I am ready to invest in that peace. I assure you, we will find peace. We will convert this tragedy into prosperity,” PREMIUM TIMES reported the Nigerian leader as saying during his visit.

He urged Mr Alia to allocate land for ranching and directed the Minister of Agriculture and Food Security to follow up.

Across Nigeria, food insecurity is deepening. According to the 2024 Cadre Harmonisé report, over 31.5 million Nigerians face acute food insecurity, with nearly 6 million at emergency levels—many of them in the North-central and North-east regions, including Benue

“We can’t talk about food security in Nigeria without addressing insecurity,” says Ms Olajubutu, “Every woman displaced from her farm is one less producer contributing to national food supply. It’s a national emergency.”

Mr Abia believes a two-pronged solution is needed. “Short-term, we must empower displaced women with conflict-resilient farming techniques and provide land near IDP camps,” he says. “Long-term, the government must invest in trained agricultural extension workers and implement serious land reforms. Right now, most interventions are charity-based and not scalable. We need systemic, government-backed investment to rebuild agriculture in these communities.”",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/811934-fields-of-fear-militia-attacks-in-benue-force-women-off-farmlands.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"2027: Premature political campaigns, By Jibrin Ibrahim","This week, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) organised a round table to address the challenges of premature political campaigns in Nigeria. The controversy started way back in July 2024, almost three years to the next election, when people based in Abuja woke up to find billboards all over the city featuring President Tinubu holding his wife (Remi) with a clear message or caption “Grassroots support for Tinubu 2027”. The meaning of the billboard was for many very clear. The President was launching his campaign for a second term. Many participants at the roundtable argued however that we cannot be sure it was the president’s initiative because Nigeria has a tradition of third-party campaigning which might have the support of the person but in some cases, friends simply take the initiative without clearance from the intended candidate. There could also be cases of mischief in which political opponents will launch a campaign to make their opponent appear to be in breach of the law. In this case, the sponsor of the advert was a group called “Dark Matters” but no one seams to know who they are.

The controversy arose because regulatory agencies did not immediately respond to the breach. All billboard messages have to be approved by the advertising regulatory agency and the question that was posed was did they approve the message and did they check whether such content violated the law and finally, did Dark Matters have the authority of the president to place such an advert. Shortly after, more adverts appeared in Dutse (Jigawa State) and other towns in the state with the slogan “Tinubu Continuity 2027”, often alongside Governor Umar Namadi. These appeared at major road junctions and public spaces.

INEC issued a warning that prospective candidates should be aware that they were jumping the gun by starting their campaigns before the umpire has given the required authorization. The Presidency officially disowned these campaign materials, calling them premature, unauthorised, and in breach of the electoral law. The statement specifically referenced appearances in Abuja, Kano, and Dutse and demanded the immediate removal of the posters. It did not happen and the campaign posters continues to proliferate. Someaspirants also use cultural festivals and religious gatherings to talk about their good qualities for political office while others even go as far as issuing branded “campaign” vehicles. More recently, numerous social media influencers and content creators have become key players and fronts, flooding platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Tik-Tok, YouTube, and X with songs, skits, and hashtags that project particular aspirants many months before the permission of the law.

The Electoral Act 2022 is clear on this matter. Section 94.—(1) states that ”for the purpose of this act, the period of campaigning in public by every political party shall commence 150 days before polling day and end 24 hours prior to that day.”

As the INEC National Commissioner, Professor Abdu Zuru explained at the round table, this safeguard was introduced to ensure fairness, reduce political tension, and guarantee a level playing field for aspirants. Unfortunately, what has happened is the widespread and determined actions by politicians to circumvent, stretch, and even undermine this law. Often, third-party actors such as associations, professional groups, religious groups or political support groups are used as convenient fronts for disguised early campaigning.

In his own remarks, the INEC Chairman Mahmoud Yakubu said that Nigerians are correct in expecting: “INEC, as registrar and regulator of political parties, to act in the face of the brazen breach of the law on early campaign. However, the major challenge for the Commission is the law itself. Sections 94(2) of the Electoral Act 2022 imposes sanctions, albeit mild (a maximum amount of N500,000 on conviction), on any political party or a person acting on its behalf who engaged in campaigns 24 hours before polling day. However, there is no sanction whatsoever concerning breaches for campaigns earlier than 150 days to an election. Here lies the challenge for the Commission in dealing with early campaign by political parties, prospective candidates and their supporters.”

Another problem with the Electoral Act 92.—(4) is its categorical provision that:

“No registered political party in Nigeria, its aspirants or candidate shall be prevented from holding rallies, processions or meetings at any time for their constitutional political purposes, and the Police shall in a consultative manner, resolve any conflict of time and venue between and amongst parties where such arises.”

Aspirants who break the premature campaigning provision could always evoke this one to escape any sanction for the breach they have committed. The way forward is to refine the regulatory framework so that what constitutes premature or early campaigning is more clearly defined to avoid the ambiguities that create loopholes. It is important to strengthen enforcement, ensuring that violations are detected early and sanctioned firmly, be it by political parties, individuals, or their proxies. We must engage media organizations and social media platforms, encouraging them to cooperate in moderating content that undermines the electoral timetable. And we must intensify civic education to enlighten citizens, especially the youth, on the dangers of endorsing and promoting early campaigns.

As the leading culprits in premature campaigning are in fact people in government, civil society must be clearer and more insistent in exposing the challenges to democracy and the rule of law when members of the governing class deliberately break the law and act as if they are above it. In this regard, regulatory agencies should be bolder and more proactive in responding to breaches.

The keynote speaker, Professor Attahiru Jega made the following useful recommendations.

All election campaign offences, especially premature campaign offences, should be carefully defined, stiff penalties specified, and strictly applied where applicable.

All candidates and their parties, and especially incumbent office holders and their political parties, should be vicariously held responsible and penalized for premature campaigns for them by third-parties

EFCC and ICPC should pay special attention to Third-party campaigners and thoroughly interrogate their sources of funding.

In determining whether candidates and parties expenditures fall within approved limits, the estimated/determined expenditure by a third-party campaigner for the candidate/party should be taken into consideration.

The EMBs (INEC and SIECs) must be made to work closely and collaboratively to ensure appropriate imposition of sanctions and penalties where appropriate.

The recommendation for the establishment of Elections Offences Commission and Tribunal has become even more urgent and important for consideration, and should be addressed in the next/current round of electoral reforms before the 2027 elections.

"One Nigeria: How Governor Mbah is leading the Azikiwe dream, By Majeed Dahiru","The recent controversy surrounding the abandonment of a multi-billion naira contract for the construction of smart schools across the state, which was awarded to Olasijibomi Ogundele, a Lagos based Yoruba property developer, has clearly revealed Peter Mbah as a detribalised pan-Nigerian nationalist, who is leading and living out the vision of the Great Zik of Africa, of one united Nigerian nation of citizens, away from a fractured country of disunited tribesmen.

A few weeks to his inauguration as governor of Enugu State on 29 May, I had my first meeting with Peter Mbah along with a few other media personality colleagues. The meeting, which was at the instance of my good friend, brother, and perhaps one of Nigeria’s best media relations guru, Uche Anichukwu, held at the Abuja Transcorp Hilton. Present at the event was also my good friend, Ifeanyi Ossai, then deputy governor-elect of Enugu State. For many years, I have been deeply connected to the political leadership of Enugu State, to the extent that the it has become my second “state of origin.” And in these years, I have come to appreciate a leadership value system that is firmly hinged on a deep connection between the political leaders and the people of the state. In my close interaction with leading lights of Enugu State, such as former Governor Ifeanyi Uguwanyi; former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekwerenmadu; former House of Representative members, Patrick Asadu and Toby Okechukwu, among many others, I have come to the realisation that if there is one state in Nigeria where democracy is truly work-in-progress, it is my second home state.

But throughout my years of involvement in Enugu’s affairs, I never met Peter Mbah, who was then busy carving out a niche in the ecosystem of Nigeria’s organised private sector, as a leading player in the oil and gas industry as the chairman of Pinnacle Limited, until the Abuja meeting. At the meeting, Peter Ndubuisi Mbah, a lawyer, business man and politician, who had previously served as chief of staff in the administration of former Governor Chimaroke Nnamani, in a very calm, composed and stoic mien, took us through his vision for the state. In fact, he reiterated his campaign promises, including the creation of a $30 billion economy, resuscitation of urban water supply, ending the Monday imposed sit-at-home, upgrading of health facilities and, most importantly, building smart schools to usher Enugu children into a future that is already present. Listening keenly to this gentleman, I saw a serous minded person who was very keen on the business of governance.

Satisfied that Peter Mbah knew exactly what he wanted to do as governor, I decided to quip in a little suggestion on the need for him to run an administration that would be inclusive of all Nigerians resident in the state, irrespective of ethnicity and religion, especially given the fact that Enugu was the capital of the old Eastern Region. I specifically made this suggestion because of the widespread perception that the Igbo people are not accommodating of other groups, even as they are well accommodated outside their eastern region homeland, and this issue is often weaponised against their politicians who are seeking the highest office in the country. As I made this appeal, Governor Peter Mbah, an otherwise straight faced man with an expressionless mien, let out a smile of appreciation, without saying a word. Little did I know that I was preaching Catholicism to the Bishop of Rome.

By entrusting some of his most important project in the hands of “others”, Governor Mbah’s action has clearly vindicated the Igbo people of Nigeria and rebranded their image as a people who truly believe in the philosophy of “Nwanne di na mba” (a brethren can be found in foreign land). Interestingly, Olasijibomi Ogundele is not the first and only beneficiary of Enugu State government patronage within the context of this commentary.

The recent controversy surrounding the abandonment of a multi-billion naira contract for the construction of smart schools across the state, which was awarded to Olasijibomi Ogundele, a Lagos based Yoruba property developer, has clearly revealed Peter Mbah as a detribalised pan-Nigerian nationalist, who is leading and living out the vision of the Great Zik of Africa, of one united Nigerian nation of citizens, away from a fractured country of disunited tribesmen. After all, it all began in 1952 when Nnamdi Azikiwe’s NCNC political party threw up Mallam Umaru Altine, a Hausa speaking Muslim from northern Nigeria, who was a resident in Enugu city, as the Mayor of the regional capital in the Igbo homeland; a feat in national integration that has remained a reference point in national unity for more than half a century.

This commentary is not about the business dispute between Olasijibomi Ogundele and Enugu State government but more about the fact that Governor Peter Mbah has shattered the myth or, if you like, the fallacy and falsehood about Ndigbo not being accommodating of others, as they want others to accommodate them. By entrusting some of his most important project in the hands of “others”, Governor Mbah’s action has clearly vindicated the Igbo people of Nigeria and rebranded their image as a people who truly believe in the philosophy of “Nwanne di na mba” (a brethren can be found in foreign land). Interestingly, Olasijibomi Ogundele is not the first and only beneficiary of Enugu State government patronage within the context of this commentary.

Recently, the Governor commissioned five ultra-modern bus terminals in Enugu State, as part of his administration’s transportation master plan to provide affordable and seamless interconnectivity across the state’s major towns and city centre. Four of those terminals were constructed by Planets Projects, a Lagos based construction company, whose major promoter is Engineer Biodun Otunola. The modern Oshodi bus terminal in Lagos was constructed by the same firm. Similarly, the multi-billion naira Enugu State Command and Control Centre, which is reported to be the biggest in Nigeria, with AI-enabled surveillance cameras across the state vide fibre optic cables, was built by Hajaraisan Nig Limited. The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of that company is Aminu Uba Miko, an indigene of Kano State, while Ibrahim Shehu from Jigawa State was engaged to develop the Enugu State Vehicles’ Identification System Software. And, XEJET, the operator of the recently launched Enugu Air – owned by the state – was founded by Emmanuel Izah from Kogi State.

Peter Mbah’s Enugu State is the Nigeria of our dream. And when next the Igbo people of Nigeria are being accused wrongly of insularity or a narrow worldview, they should point in the direction of Peter Mbah’s Enugu State. Like I have consistently maintained, Nigerians are essentially one people and the various ethnic groupings are simply members of the same family who are living in different parts of the family compound.

The good thing about these engagements is that they were competitively bided for, but the chances of Yoruba or Hausa owned companies turning out as the preferred bidders were not limited from winning the contract in Peter Mbah’s modern Enugu State. Just as Planets Project has a track record in transport infrastructure construction and management, so does Olasijibomi’s Sujimoto Property construction firm have a solid track record as a pioneer of smart buildings in Africa. That the Enugu State government has taken steps to sanction Olasijibomi Ogundele clearly shows that Governor Mbah has no incestuous relationship with the young man and his engagement was purely based on the belief that he could deliver on the job.

Away from these few cases, amongst many others, Governor Mbah, in making strategic appointments in Enugu State, has demonstrated the oneness of Nigeria, in which the principles of inclusion, equity and justice reigns supreme. The Managing Director of Enugu State Broadcasting Service is Ladi Akeredolu-Ale, a veteran broadcaster from Ondo State, while the man helping Governor Peter Mbah to drive his vision for available, accessible and affordable healthcare is Dr Yomi Jaye, his special adviser on Health Matters. To help boost the Internally Generated Revenue of the state, Governor Mbah hired Adenike Okebu as his senior special assistant on Revenue. While Alhaji Abubakar Yusuf Sambo serves as the governor’s senior special assistant on Special Duties, the Commander of Enugu Forest Guard is Olamitisoji Akinbamilayo, a retired Deputy Commissioner of Police, who served in the Enugu State Command. The retired DCP was in charge of operations when Governor Mbah directed the full implementation of the ban on sit-at-home and other violent activities by miscreants. For his meritorious service to the state, DCP Akinbamilayo was retained by the state as part of its security management team.

Peter Mbah’s Enugu State is the Nigeria of our dream. And when next the Igbo people of Nigeria are being accused wrongly of insularity or a narrow worldview, they should point in the direction of Peter Mbah’s Enugu State. Like I have consistently maintained, Nigerians are essentially one people and the various ethnic groupings are simply members of the same family who are living in different parts of the family compound. A movement from one part of the family compound to another should not render a member of the family an outsider inside his/her family compound. This is called citizenship. And as citizens of Nigeria, we should be free to reside in any part of the federation without the dichotomy of “indigene and settler,” wherein one’s ethnicity can enhance or diminish access to state provision and protection. The fundamental condition preceding national development and security of any sovereign entity is the social cohesion, national integration and unity of the constituent peoples. Now we know why Peter Mbah’s Enugu State is working progressively.

"Time for a general rollout of the African passport, By Simbo Olorunfemi and Ade Adefeko","“Africa is today at midcourse, in transition from the Africa of yesterday to the Africa of Tomorrow. Even as we stand here, we move from the past into the future. The task, on which we have embarked, the making of Africa, will not wait. We must act, to shape and mould the future and leave our imprint on events as they slip past into history.” – His Imperial Majesty, Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia, May 1963

In a matter of days, the 4th edition of the Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF2025) organised by theAfrican Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), in partnership with the African Union Commission,will kick off in Algiers, the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria. The IATF is recognised as Africa’s premier trade and investment forum for the promotion of intra-African trade. A biennial platform for showcasing investment opportunities across the continent is expected to host over 2,000 exhibitors from 75 exhibiting countries. 35,000 visitors from around the world are expected, with trade and investment deals valued at over US$44 billion projected to be finalised at the event, which will also feature the Creative Africa Nexus (CANEX) summit for creative industries and the Africa Automotive Show.

The Intra-African Trade Fair is an offshoot of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), a flagship project of the African Union under the ‘Agenda 2063’, which is aimed at bringing together the 55 African Union member states and eight Regional Economic Communities to establish a single market of over 1.4 billion people for goods and services across the continent, eliminating tariffs on most goods and liberalizing trade in services creating the world’s largest free trade area, with a GDP exceeding US$3.5 trillion.

Beyond trade in goods and services across Africa, the free movement of Africans across the continent, with roots in Aspiration 2, is integral to Agenda 2063. It was envisioned as thecornerstone for achieving an integrated and peaceful Africa. In furtherance of this objective, the Protocol to the Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community, relating to Free Movement of Persons, Right of Residence and Right of Establishment, was adopted in January 2018, with a three-phase implementation proposed, starting with the abolition of visas for African Union citizens traveling within the continent, the right of African Union citizens to reside in any member state, and the right of establishment to live, work freely and establish businesses. Unfortunately, this has not generated as much traction as it should have.

To date, only 32 member states of the African Union have signed the Protocol, with onlyRwanda having ratified it. The African Passport, which was endorsed by the AU as part of this framework to facilitate free movement, is yet to be rolled out for general use, restricted for now to only officials and diplomats. It is not a surprise that the increase in intra-African tradeand investment, as envisioned, has not materialised, and the march towards the realisation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has not sluggish.

One would have thought that priority in terms of rollout of the African passport would be given to African investors and those involved in intra-African business. Only last year, Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote spoke out at the Africa CEO Forum Annual Summit in Kigali about the inconvenience that comes with his needing 35 visas to travel around Africa:

“As an investor, as somebody who already wants to make Africa great, I have to now apply for 35 different visas on my passport, and I really don’t have the time to go and drop my passport in embassies to get a visa. But you see, the most annoying thing is that if you are treating everybody the same, then I can understand, but I can assure you, some people don’t need 35 visas.” He compared his situation to that of the French Executive who was also at the forum, saying: “I can assure you that Patrick (Pouyanné) doesn’t need 35 visas on a French passport, which means you have freer movement than myself in Africa.”

It was in the bid to address this issue and facilitate free movement across Africa that the African Development Bank (AfDB), under the leadership of Dr Akinwumi Adesina, introduced the Africa Visa Openness Index (AVOI) in collaboration with the African Union Commission and the World Economic Forum in recognition of the role of visa openness in the AfDB’s Ten-Year Strategy and Africa’s broader integration aspirations. The index evaluates three main visa categories imposed by each country on the citizens of the other 53 nations: visa required before travel, visa on arrival, and visa-free entry.

The Index reports an improvement since it began tracking visa openness in 2016, with Benin, Rwanda, Seychelles, and The Gambia standing out as leaders, allowing visa-free entry to all African citizens. But even with the increasing adoption of electronic visas (e-visas) by African countries, which is helping to streamline the visa application processes in some of these countries, the 2024 report notes a slight decline in the combined visa openness score for the countries.

West Africa and East Africa have 8 countries each in the top 20 on the ranking. Cape Verde and Nigeria share the 6th place, for offering visa on arrival to many African countries and visa-free access to others. While 39 countries have improved their scores over previous years, the barriers are still largely pervasive.

The irony is that not even hosting the Intra-African Trade Fair could convince Algeria, the host country, to grant visa-free access or visa-on-arrival to participants from other African countries. One of us had to travel from one part of the country to the other to be able to process the application for visa. Shouldn’t it be a condition for the host nation for such a major event to allow for visa-free access for participants? That should be the least of expectations if we are truly serious about promoting inter-African trade.

The African passport is a major initiative African Union (AU) that should be ardently pursued to enable Africans to travel, work, study, and live more freely within the continent without the need for visas. Fears have been raised in some quarters about the universal availability of the biometric infrastructure and the building of the requisite technology needed for adoption. There are also concerns around issues of national security, migration, and harmonization of standards, but all of these fears and concerns can be sorted out where there is the requisite political will.

It is time to open up the roll-out to more Africans, starting with the investment and business community. The African Passport will help to unlock Africa’s integration potential by easing travel restrictions. The next edition of the Intra-African Trade Fair should not have intending participants from other African countries scampering all over the place for a one-week, single-entry visa to another African country, in the name of deepening intra-African trade. It defeats the purpose. We need to put in more work bringing down the walls as we work on Agenda-2063.

"Olukoyede: The quiet champion of integrity at Nigeria’s EFCC, By Raymond Igwe","Olanipekun Olukoyede has shown that integrity does not need noise and that leadership is best demonstrated through results, not rhetoric. By avoiding the distractions of politics, embracing humane and world-class investigative practices, and prioritising quiet but impactful reforms, he has set the EFCC on a path of renewed credibility.

When President Bola Ahmed Tinubu appointed Olanipekun “Ola” Olukoyede as Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in October 2023, the decision was met with cautious optimism. Today, barely two years into his tenure, it is clear that the President’s choice was not only right but visionary. Olukoyede has quietly redefined the culture of Nigeria’s foremost anti-graft institution, steering it away from spectacle and politics, and restoring faith in professionalism, integrity, and fairness.

A seasoned lawyer, fraud examiner, and compliance specialist with years of experience both at home and abroad, Olukoyede came prepared for the task. Having previously served as EFCC Chief of Staff and later as Secretary to the Commission, he understood the pitfalls of the institution and the expectations of Nigerians. He brought to the office a deliberate resolve: to fight corruption firmly, yet with humanity; to pursue justice with world-class best practices; and to keep the EFCC above the fray of political battles.

His record so far speaks volumes. Within his first 100 days, the EFCC under his leadership recovered over ₦70.5 billion, processed more than 2,600 petitions, and secured 747 convictions. Asset recovery has reached unprecedented levels, including the forfeiture of a major university and a sprawling estate of 753 housing units. Large-scale syndicates, from romance scams to cryptocurrency fraud, have been busted in operations that drew applause for their scope and precision. Yet, unlike in the past when media trials often tainted the Commission’s work, Olukoyede’s EFCC pursues its mandate quietly, letting the facts and the courts speak for themselves.

Equally significant is his courage to clean house. For the first time in the agency’s history, a Chairman openly admitted to corruption within the Commission itself. In 2024, he dismissed 27 staff for misconduct and sanctioned investigations into internal fraud, including a $400,000 scandal involving a unit head. Such transparency is rare in Nigeria’s public institutions and has set a new benchmark for accountability.

Olukoyede has also earned recognition both at home and abroad. From integrity awards in Lagos to a certificate of recognition from the Canadian government for his role in combating transnational crime, his leadership style has resonated beyond Nigeria’s shores. These honors underscore the global respect that comes with his quiet, professional approach.

Perhaps what stands out most is his ability to stay above politics. In a country where anti-corruption campaigns are often weaponised for political battles, Olukoyede has been deliberate in insulating the EFCC from partisan influence. His investigations are guided by facts, not headlines; his focus is on institution-building, not personal grandstanding. This restraint has restored credibility to the Commission, assuring both the public and international partners that Nigeria is serious about fighting corruption in a fair and just manner.

Olanipekun Olukoyede has shown that integrity does not need noise and that leadership is best demonstrated through results, not rhetoric. By avoiding the distractions of politics, embracing humane and world-class investigative practices, and prioritising quiet but impactful reforms, he has set the EFCC on a path of renewed credibility. In doing so, he has emerged as one of the quiet champions of President Tinubu’s administration, a reformer who proves that in the battle against corruption, professionalism and integrity remain Nigeria’s strongest weapons.

"An unusual view of banditry, By Azu Ishiekwene","The usual narrative frames bandits, jihadists, and religious extremists as “criminals and terrorists.” The study, however, takes a nuanced approach that offers an alternative view, distinguishing banditry from jihadism or other criminal franchises mainly on the basis of ideology, geography and modes of operation.

Zamfara State Governor, Dauda Lawal, is hardly in the news. Lawal has enough on his plate in a region struggling with banditry and insurgency, and in a state whose political heavyweights oppose him over political differences.

He has learnt to mind the state’s business, hardly ever throwing stones, except when attacked by Abuja politicians who live in glass houses.

It was, therefore, a surprise last week when he released a viral video that made headlines. Following the increase in banditry in the region, especially in Zamfara and neighbouring Katsina State, which left at least 17 dead in two weeks, the governor said that, left to him, he could end the scourge in two months.

The question is, how? “I swear to Almighty Allah,” Lawal said, “wherever a bandit leader is in Zamfara, I know. And if he goes out, I know. With my mobile phone, I can show you where these bandits are today. But we cannot do anything beyond our powers.” If only he had the power to give direct orders, the governor said, he would end banditry in Zamfara in 60 days.

Complicated Reality

The reality is a little more complicated. Depending on your source, an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people have been killed in banditry and insurgency-related fatalities in the North-West alone in the last 10 years. This is on the scale of lives lost in the Kosovo War, or 40 per cent of the toll in Sierra Leone’s 10-year civil war, even though non-state actors are waging banditry.

The numbers hardly reflect the suffering of thousands of children whose parents have been killed, homes without mothers or loved ones, individuals permanently injured or displaced, sources of livelihood destroyed, futures ruined, and a present lived in fear and uncertainty.

Lawal once told a story of how some bandits, whose plans were intercepted based on intelligence, managed to get away before he could get through the Byzantine chain of military command in Abuja. He is right to be frustrated by a system that reduces governors to figureheads in the face of severe security challenges, because we’re afraid that governors could abuse state police.

Sociology of Banditry

Yet, it would take more than technology and decentralised policing to curtail the menace. That is what an August study by the Danish Institute of International Studies suggests. The findings, which were just released, are worth considering.

The study, by Peer Schouten and Barnett James, the former a senior researcher, and the latter, a PhD student at Oxford University, is entitled “Divided, They Rule? The Emerging Banditry Landscape in Northwest Nigeria.” It examines the sociology of banditry, its roots and evolution, and how it has displaced jihadists who were predominantly a Sahelian franchise in scale and impact.

In plain language, the study says that banditry, which has evolved over the last nearly 15 years, especially, is reproducing a distinct feature of the Caliphate system in Northern Nigeria, which, among other things, depended heavily on “raiding and tribute-taking” for its expansion and sustenance.

The usual narrative frames bandits, jihadists, and religious extremists as “criminals and terrorists.” The study, however, takes a nuanced approach that offers an alternative view, distinguishing banditry from jihadism or other criminal franchises mainly on the basis of ideology, geography and modes of operation.

It says, for example, that, “Unlike jihadist groups, bandit networks operate without ideological ambitions, but significantly influence rural governance, challenging state authority through both roving predation and stationary extortion.”

If It Smells Like Banditry….

I often use the terms interchangeably. If they talk like bandits, strike like bandits, and leave behind a trail of sorrow, tears and blood, then, for me, they are bandits, jihadists, criminals and terrorists. The point of the study, however, is that without establishing motive and methodology, response and policy could miss the mark.

To speak Lawalese, the Zamfara State governor or any governor in Nigeria’s North-West, who is interested in tackling insecurity, might need more than executive authority to succeed. They would need, in addition to state police (which I support fully), to understand the social psychology of the enemy they’re dealing with. Otherwise, we might be worse off in two times twenty months or whatever time Lawal might need.

This study shares how, through a pattern of “roving predation and stationary extortion,” bandits have, since 2011, created a system of governance “that echoes, in significant ways, precolonial patterns of rule and extraction in the region.”

Echoes of the Caliphate

In plain language, the study says that banditry, which has evolved over the last nearly 15 years, especially, is reproducing a distinct feature of the Caliphate system in Northern Nigeria, which, among other things, depended heavily on “raiding and tribute-taking” for its expansion and sustenance.

“Today’s banditry,” the study says, “reproduces these patterns, with modern motorcycles and mobile phones replacing the horses and single-shot muskets of the 19th century. While the tools have changed, the underlying dynamics of rule and accumulation remain strikingly familiar to the affected rural communities.”

The research does not assume that the bandits are all Fulanis, as was the case mainly in the 18th and 19th centuries. Or that they harbour the state-building aspiration or religious zeal of the jihadists of the time. It, however, observes recurrent patterns of authority and legitimacy in these regions similar to the Caliphate model.

In other words, in a strange mutational trajectory, bandits are transforming from “criminals and terrorists” to “carers,” filling the void of absentee governments. Call it the Stockholm Syndrome, if you like, but those who wondered why bandit-in-chief Kachalla Ado Aliero was crowned Sarkin Fulani in Zamfara in 2022 need not wonder anymore.

Hydra-headed Monster

Lawal agonised about missing a prime bandit target because of command bureaucracy. The military, on its part, has also targeted prominent bandit leaders, the most recent successes being Baleri Fakai and Halilu Buzu.

These were significant strides in the battle against banditry. This study, however, likens the bandit network to a hydra-headed monster. It’s a loose confederacy that adapts and replicates itself, even after removing the current leader. They are designed to survive the loss of their leaders, whose elimination is sometimes unwelcome by the host community.

Why? Last year, when Halilu Sububu was killed, for example, one source told the researchers that, “It was an error to kill Buzu (Halilu). He started doing good things, telling bandits to stop harassing the Fulani. He had a positive influence in Zamfara, Kaduna, Katsina, Kebbi and Sokoto.”

In other words, in a strange mutational trajectory, bandits are transforming from “criminals and terrorists” to “carers,” filling the void of absentee governments. Call it the Stockholm Syndrome, if you like, but those who wondered why bandit-in-chief Kachalla Ado Aliero was crowned Sarkin Fulani in Zamfara in 2022 need not wonder anymore.

And those rightly outraged by the foolishness of making peace deals with bandits, instead of bombing them to dust, might wish to pause. As they say in South West Nigeria, when the leaf has wrapped the soap bar for too long, they become indistinguishable.

Quoting an instance in a pathetic case, the study says, “In 2024, kachalla Najaja’s men (bandits) punished Anka town (in Zamfara) for harbouring vigilantes by preventing its residents from harvesting millet, using starvation as a tool to force submission. Desperate villagers ultimately negotiated ‘peace’ by paying N50 million. One negotiator reflected, ‘Our local ruler forbade us to negotiate, but he could not offer us protection nor guarantee us food.’”

Loot Big, Die Poor

What do the bandits do with the money? They store their “wealth,” mainly from tributes, ransom cash, and rustled cattle, in fungible forms, which they use to purchase more cattle, but especially to buy more arms, a significant status symbol. Like the slave-holding elite of precolonial Africa, the prestige of bandit leaders is sometimes measured in their retinue of fighters, abductees or dependents. They make no pretence to egalitarianism. The leader enjoys a chunk of the loot.

Yet, despite their legendary fame, a Kebbi hunter tells the researchers, “They have few worldly possessions” and die poor.

The study concludes that banditry happens in the absence of sustained commitment to rural development, the creation of economic opportunity, and institutional reform. It’s thought-worthy for any government interested in a long-term solution.

"Did Temi Otedola just prove that Nigerian designers are replaceable?, By Tessy Oliseh-Amaize","Temi Otedola didn’t snub Nigerian designers; she expanded the runway… She proved that any designer with the vision, skill, and storytelling craft — regardless of origin — can be called to interpret any culture. In doing so, she quietly dismantled the illusion that cultural identity alone guarantees relevance.

When the wedding images of Temi Otedola (now Temi Ajibade) surfaced online — resplendent in traditional Nigerian outfits crafted by mostly non-Nigerian designers, including celebrated American couturier, Zac Posen — they quickly stirred mixed reactions across social media. “Temi Otedola & Mr Eazi should have done their wedding in Nigeria to support Naija brands. Doesn’t make sense carrying that money to foreigners,” one influencer posted on X (formerly Twitter).

And to be fair, it’s easy to see where that view is coming from.

Temi is not just any bride. She’s a high-profile Nigerian elite, a member of one of the country’s most influential families, and someone whose choices are always under a cultural and political microscope. For some, her decision to outsource the design of deeply traditional Yoruba garments to foreign designers felt symbolic — a redirection of resources and prestige away from Nigerian creatives at a time when the local industry is fighting for recognition, patronage, and sustainability.

To these observers, this wasn’t just a fashion choice. A Nigerian woman of wealth and influence taking money and visibility, perhaps even cultural authority, abroad. And in a country where the elite frequently crossover into government or public influence, that symbolism hits deeper.

So yes, I understand the disappointment. But here’s what I also see: Temi’s choice wasn’t just about fashion; it was a wake-up call. And not to her critics, but to Nigerian designers themselves.

Beneath the criticism lies an assumption that only Nigerians can or should design traditional Nigerian clothing. But this moment disrupts that notion. Zac Posen, though not Nigerian by heritage, created a look that paid homage to Yoruba culture, while exuding the polish of a global luxury label. In doing so, Temi demonstrated that cultural design is no longer the exclusive domain of cultural insiders. If an outsider can interpret Nigerian tradition with elegance and respect, then our fashion has become part of a wider, global conversation. And that’s not a threat; it’s an opportunity.

What the Zac Posen moment really revealed is a sense of creative complacency within parts of Nigeria’s fashion industry. Many designers have thrived as local champions in traditional wear, but Nigerian designers can no longer rely on cultural fluency alone. If it isn’t matched with global branding, innovative storytelling, tailoring precision, and reach, it will fall short. Irreplaceability is no longer guaranteed.

Temi’s move is a signal: the bar has shifted. For a generation shaped by Instagram, Afrobeats, and Netflix’s global Nollywood, origin matters less than creative capacity. If Temi could commission a foreign designer to interpret Yoruba heritage, what’s stopping an Indian billionaire from asking a Nigerian designer to reimagine the sari? What’s stopping a Brazilian client from requesting a Nigerian take on carnival couture?

We are in a moment of cultural cross-pollination, and the doors are swinging both ways. Now, Nigerian designers can position themselves not just as local custodians of tradition, but as interpreters of global culture. You shouldn’t only master iro and buba, kaftans, or boubou. You should be able to infuse the Nigerian spirit into a kimono, lehenga, hanbok, or even a Scottish kilt, because fashion isn’t just about fabric. It’s also about perspective.

The designers who win on the world stage are those who can see beyond borders, who can take a thread from Lagos and weave it into a silhouette in Tokyo, Paris, or Rio.

What the Zac Posen moment really revealed is a sense of creative complacency within parts of Nigeria’s fashion industry. Many designers have thrived as local champions in traditional wear, but Nigerian designers can no longer rely on cultural fluency alone. If it isn’t matched with global branding, innovative storytelling, tailoring precision, and reach, it will fall short. Irreplaceability is no longer guaranteed.

It’s not enough to say, “I know how to make agbada.” The real question is: Can you make the world want to wear your agbada? Can you reinterpret someone else’s heritage with the same originality and care you bring to your own?

It’s not that Nigerian designers are not needed. It’s that they are no longer immune to competition beyond their borders. That immunity was built on cultural monopoly. That monopoly is now broken.

In today’s fashion landscape, cultural expression is fluid, collaborative, and borderless. Designers across the world are blending traditions, co-creating new silhouettes, and redefining identity through style.

So instead of asking, “Why Zac Posen or Oscar de la Renta?” We should be asking: “Which Nigerian designer is ready to be the Zac Posen of another culture?” That’s the real question.

Temi Otedola didn’t snub Nigerian designers; she expanded the runway.

She proved that any designer with the vision, skill, and storytelling craft — regardless of origin — can be called to interpret any culture. In doing so, she quietly dismantled the illusion that cultural identity alone guarantees relevance.

It’s not that Nigerian designers are not needed. It’s that they are no longer immune to competition beyond their borders. That immunity was built on cultural monopoly. That monopoly is now broken.

FirstBank wins appeal in landmark case against General Hydrocarbons,"First Bank of Nigeria Limited (FirstBank) has recorded a major victory at the Court of Appeal in its dispute with General Hydrocarbons Limited (GHL).

In a judgment delivered on Thursday, the Court of Appeal, specially convened during its vacation at the instance of GHL, set aside the earlier decision of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt, which had dismissed FirstBank’s claims over the diversion of proceeds from the sale of crude oil pledged as collateral for loan facilities.

The dispute centred on crude oil aboard the FPSO Tamara Tokoni, which GHL had pledged to FirstBank as security for substantial loan facilities. Contrary to the pledge, GHL allegedly diverted proceeds from the sale of the cargo, prompting the bank to seek judicial intervention.

FirstBank appealed the trial court’s ruling, which had treated the matter as a simple debt recovery claim.

The Court of Appeal, however, upheld the bank’s position, affirming the maritime nature of the dispute and stressing the importance of preserving the res (the crude oil cargo) as the core subject of litigation. It accordingly set aside the trial court’s order vacating the arrest of the second respondent.

The appellate court granted FirstBank’s appeal, ordered the sale of the crude oil aboard the FPSO Tamara Tokoni, and directed that the proceeds be lodged in an interest-bearing escrow account under the custody of the Chief Registrar of the Court of Appeal.

The Registrar was further mandated to take possession of the cargo and safeguard it against any dissipation or unauthorised disposal pending resolution of the case at both the trial court and the court of arbitration.

This ruling represents a significant milestone for FirstBank, reinforcing its commitment to protecting its assets, upholding the integrity of financial transactions, and safeguarding the interests of its stakeholders.

Experts also said the judgment established a strong precedent for the enforcement of collateral agreements and accountability in high-value commercial transactions.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/promoted/820481-firstbank-wins-appeal-in-landmark-case-against-general-hydrocarbons.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Resident doctors commence five-day warning strike,"The Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) on Friday commenced a five-day warning strike after accusing the federal government of ignoring long-standing demands over welfare and remuneration.

NARD, which constitutes the bulk of medical personnel in Nigeria’s tertiary hospitals, said the action was necessary as government inaction had left doctors with no choice.

Previous strikes by resident doctors have often crippled services across hospitals nationwide.

The strike was confirmed in a statement titled “Declaration of strike action” and signed by NARD Secretary-General, Oluwasola Odunbaku.

“As clearly stated in our earlier communique, the strike is scheduled to commence at 8:00 a.m. today (Friday),” it said.

“All Centre leadership is expected to guide their members accordingly. Further updates will be communicated to NEC members in due course.”

The doctors had issued a 24-hour ultimatum to the federal government on Wednesday to address its outstanding demands, following the expiration of an earlier 10-day deadline on 10 September.

NARD had, in July, issued a three-week ultimatum, but in the interest of industrial harmony, the NEC extended the deadline to allow for further engagement with stakeholders.

Demands, grievances

Among the grievances are the non-disbursement of the 2025 Medical Residency Training Fund (MRTF), payment of five months’ arrears from the revised Consolidated Medical Salary Structure (CONMESS), and outstanding specialist and hazard allowances.

The doctors also conveyed disappointment at the federal government’s failure to fulfil its commitments regarding the release of funds for the payment of the outstanding 2025 MRTF to numerous resident doctors.

It said these doctors remain unpaid despite multiple ultimatums and extensions.

It also criticised the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria for downgrading membership certificates from the West African Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons.

“The E-NEC also received an update on the woefully inadequate efforts exerted by the Oyo State government to tackle the challenges confronting members of the ARD LAUTECH Teaching Hospital, Ogbomosho, amidst an ongoing indefinite strike action at the institution.

“The E-NEC condemned the negligence exhibited by most state governments in paying the MRTF to resident doctors under their employ, deeming this an act of gross insensitivity.”

It also expressed disappointment in the federal government’s failure to address its demands despite numerous ultimatums issued.

Call to action

To avoid indefinite industrial action, the doctors are demanding the immediate disbursement of the 2025 MRTF and the settlement of five months of outstanding CONMESS arrears, along with other unpaid allowances.

It also called on the MDCN to restore recognition of the West African postgraduate membership certificates and urged the National Postgraduate Medical College of Nigeria to promptly issue certificates to qualified candidates in line with international best practices.

The council further appealed to all state governors to prioritise doctors’ welfare, ensure timely payment of MRTF, and take proactive measures to curb emigration while maintaining industrial harmony.

FCT doctors’ separate action

In a related development, the Association of Resident Doctors in the Federal Capital Territory (ARD-FCT) embarked on a seven-day warning strike on 8 September.

In a communiqué signed by ARD-FCT President George Ebong and other executives, the doctors listed lack of manpower, poor welfare, unpaid salaries, unexplained deductions, the psychological toll of long working hours, and the absence of new recruitment in FCT hospitals since 2011 as key issues.

The strike is scheduled to run until 15 September, after which the doctors said they would review their action based on government response.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/820636-resident-doctors-commence-five-day-warning-strike.html,https://premiumtimesng.com

What next for Mali as Wagner fails to defeat insurgents?,"Last month, The Sentry, a United States (US) organisation that exposes ‘multinational predatory networks that benefit from violent conflict, repression, and kleptocracy’, issued a report asserting that Wagner had failed in Mali.

The report’s conclusions made waves in Africa and beyond – especially Europe. The notorious Russian mercenary/private security company’s entry into Mali in 2022/23 was regarded with alarm, including by pro-Western African states.

Wagner’s arrival was seen in the West as the spearhead of Russia’s determined strategy to displace Western, particularly French, influence in the Sahel and beyond. Wagner was invited in by the Assimi Goïta-led military junta that ousted Mali’s civilian government in 2020, and expelled French troops that had been helping repel jihadists and separatists for a decade.

The Sentry’s report was no doubt reassuring to Western eyes, as it painted a picture of an organisation that seemed less threatening to Western interests than they had feared.

Wagner’s main mission was to defeat the insurgents and rebels. Though France helped prevent these forces from capturing the capital and the country in 2013, French and Malian troops failed to follow through in succeeding years, and their enemies bounced back.

The failure of Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta’s government in Bamako and its French allies to bring security to Mali contributed to the 2020 and 2021 military coups that brought Mr Goïta to power. He replaced the French with Wagner in 2022. But after some initial battlefield successes, Wagner gradually found itself just as unable to defeat the insurgents as the French.

In fact, The Sentry says security is now worse than before Wagner’s entry, with an increase in attacks on civilians and civilian casualties. The Economist recently cited Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) that shows jihad-related deaths averaged 3,135 annually between 2022 and 2024 – after Wagner entered – compared to 736 annually over the previous decade. This year, almost 2,000 have been killed.

The Sentry attributes Wagner’s failure to various reasons, from arrogance (including treating Malian soldiers with racism and contempt), to incompetence (saying many were recruited from prisons), to brutalising civilians, which has cut off informant intelligence.

The Sentry also notes that Wagner hasn’t replicated its Central African Republic success, where it gained control of considerable natural resources. It says Wagner withdrew from Mali in June to be replaced by the Africa Corps – a unit of the Russian army under tighter control.

One Malian military officer told The Sentry: ‘Wagner are worse than the French … we have gone from the frying pan into the fire.’

The report concludes that Wagner has not been ‘the infallible fighting force and successful economic actor it pretended to be.’ It says this ‘should be a warning to other African clients who are considering bringing in the [Russian] Ministry of Defence-backed Africa Corps.’

This warning seems mainly directed at Niger and Burkina Faso, which also recently experienced military coups, and subsequently expelled France and other Western security support, establishing close ties with Moscow. So far, Wagner does not appear to have a combat presence in the two countries.

The Sentry says Wagner’s failure should send a message to Europe that it ‘may be operating on an outdated understanding of Wagner’s strength and tactics.’ The military group’s failure opens opportunities to exert some diplomatic influence with the Sahelian juntas, according to The Sentry.

ACLED Senior Analyst for West Africa Héni Nsaibia believes Russia’s pivot from Wagner to Africa Corps is partly a shift from battlefield engagement towards regime stabilisation, infrastructure protection and strategic influence – though it will still conduct combat operations.

But the shift is ‘in line with Russia’s overall goal of being seen as a reliable alternative to Western military partners, especially by governments affected by insurgencies or political isolation. The Africa Corps model is more sustainable and politically controllable than Wagner’s riskier, high-profile deployments.’

But will it be any better than Wagner? If Africa Corps is more disciplined and less inclined to abuse the Malian military and population, perhaps it will do better. But many believe Wagner was just the Russian military in disguise, so expecting much more from the Africa Corps could be illogical.

Maria Kucherenko, an analyst at Ukraine’s CBA Initiatives Centre, believes Wagner was never really independent. She told the US Congress last year that ‘Russian intelligence services, often operating under the guise of so-called private military companies, help their state to support dictatorial regimes and to additionally invest in blurring the rules that would regulate the functioning of this world in a peaceful way.’

She added: ‘Research conducted by the Come Back Alive Foundation has traced Wagner’s presence – along with its affiliates in the General Directorate of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation – to operations in over 70 countries.’

This included ‘propagandists, military advisers, and media operatives – spanning the full spectrum of military and non-military influence. Their name may change – Wagner, Africa Corps, or something else – but the mission remains the same: creating logistics networks designed to destabilise global security.’ Ms Kucherenko told ISS Today in Kyiv in June that of those 70 countries, 44 were in Africa.

If the Africa Corps fails, who do Malians turn to? Perhaps, as The Sentry suggests, Mali’s failure creates an opportunity for Western states to reopen the door to a renewed role in helping the country stabilise.

There seems to be little appetite to bring the French back – either among Malians or in Paris. Asked by journalists in July if France could envisage a renewed role in the Sahel, Mali’s Secretary of State for la Francophonie and International Partnerships, Thani Mohamed-Soilihi, said the security crisis was no longer a matter for his government.

However, The Economist says the US has sent officials to Bamako and other regional capitals to discuss security assistance and mineral deals. It reports that Turkey and the Gulf states also seem interested.

Some analysts suggest that the external partner’s identity is not the most important factor in determining success or failure, but rather the strategy used to combat terrorism. They say combat and non-combat military tactics, such as intelligence and training, and longer-term complementary development approaches, are needed.

It also seems in Mali’s interest to diversify its military and other support as much as possible, though current geopolitics could preclude that.

It must also be true that the endpoint should be a return to democracy. This is more likely to sustain stability and development than propping up authoritarian governments as Russia has been doing – largely, it seems, to frustrate Western interests.

"Four killed,15 injured as gunmen open fire at burial ceremony in Anambra","Some gunmen, suspected to be cultists, have killed at least four people in Anambra State, south-east Nigeria.

The incident occurred in the late hours of Thursday at a burial event in Ezi Village, Ogidi, a community in Idemili North Local Government Area of the state.

The police spokesperson in Anambra State, Tochukwu Ikenga, disclosed this in a statement seen by PREMIUM TIMES on Friday morning.

How it happened

Mr Ikenga, a superintendent of police, said the armed persons stormed the burial event and opened fire on guests, killing four persons at the spot while 15 others sustained “serious” gunshot injuries.

“Police operatives from Ogidi Division, led by the divisional police officer, swiftly mobilised to the scene, restored normalcy, and immediately evacuated the (injured) victims to hospitals for medical attention,” he said.

The spokesperson said the police operatives recovered 16 expended cartridges during the operation in the area.

He said the police in the state have launched an investigation to identify and track down the attackers.

“Further developments will be communicated in due course,” he stated.

Mr Ikenga hinted that preliminary findings suggest that the incident was connected to a clash between rival cult groups in the area.

He said the Commissioner of Police in Anambra State, Ikioye Orutugu, has condemned the incident.

Mr Orutugu assured residents of Anambra State that the police in the state were committed to ridding the state of cult-related violence and other criminal activities.

The commissioner urged residents to remain calm, security-conscious, and to continue to provide useful information to the police by reporting suspicious movements or persons for action.

Cultism in Anambra

Like many other parts of Nigeria, Anambra State has witnessed several incidents involving cultists.

In June, police foiled a cult initiation ceremony in Nawfia, Njikoka Local Government Area of the state and arrested six suspects.

In October last year, four people were killed in a clash between two rival cult groups in the community.

In July 2023, suspected cultists beheaded a rival cult leader in another community in Anambra and in November 2022, six people were shot dead in Awka, Anambra, during a shootout between two rival cult groups, amongst a series of similar killings in the state.

Cultism, mixed with the deadly activities of separatist groups in Anambra, has complicated the security challenges in the south-eastern state, despite being outlawed in the state and other parts of the country.

The laws vary from state to state. In Anambra State, for instance, cultism is outlawed by the Anambra State Secret Cult and Similar Activities Prohibition Law, 2024.

The law provides that any person who is a member of a secret cult has committed an offence, whether or not in possession of an offensive weapon, and is liable on conviction to imprisonment for life or a minimum of 21 years imprisonment without an option of fine.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-east/820580-four-killed15-injured-as-gunmen-open-fire-at-burial-ceremony-in-anambra.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"Air Peace pilots tested positive for alcohol, cannabis after the Port Harcourt runway incident – Report","Nigerian accident investigators said two Air Peace pilots tested positive for alcohol and cannabis after a runway excursion involving one of the airline’s jets in Port Harcourt in July.

In a preliminary report released Friday, the Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau (NSIB) said toxicology tests confirmed the presence of intoxicants in the captain and first officer who flew the Boeing 737 with 103 people on board.

A cabin crew member also tested positive for cannabis.

The aircraft, on a domestic flight from Lagos, landed long on Runway 21 at Port Harcourt International Airport after what investigators described as an unstabilised final approach.

The plane touched down 2,264 metres from the runway threshold and came to a halt more than 200 metres into the overrun area.

“All passengers and crew disembarked safely, and no injuries were reported,” the bureau said.

The NSIB noted, “Initial toxicological tests conducted on the flight crew revealed positive results for certain substances, including indicators of alcohol consumption. A cabin crew member also tested positive for THC, the psychoactive component in cannabis. These results are being reviewed under the human performance and safety management components of the investigation.”

It added that “Toxicological screening conducted post-incident revealed that Captain and first officer tested positive for Ethyl Glucuronide, indicating recent alcohol consumption.”

Runway excursions are one of the most frequent safety risks in commercial aviation, often caused by poor visibility, pilot error or technical faults.

The NSIB said the toxicology results suggested human performance was a critical factor in this case.

Following the findings, the agency recommended that Air Peace strengthen its crew resource management training and tighten checks on pilot fitness before dispatch.

Air Peace, Nigeria’s largest airline, operates domestic and international flights across Africa and to destinations such as London, Saudi Arabia, Dakar, Freetown, Monrovia and Ghana.

The company has yet to comment on the bureau’s report.

The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) considers intoxication by flight crew a serious breach of global safety standards.

Several airlines worldwide have faced scandals in recent years after pilots were caught under the influence, underscoring the risks to passenger safety.

The NSIB said its investigation is still ongoing.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/business-news/820576-air-peace-pilots-tested-positive-for-alcohol-cannabis-after-the-port-harcourt-runway-incident-report.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"INEC disqualifies 157 aspiring political parties, invites 14 for screening","The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said on Thursday that 157 associations seeking to be registered as political parties have failed to pass the commission’s first scrutiny and have been disqualified.

The commission also said 14 associations have scaled the first stage of scrutiny and are being considered by the commission.

According to a statement by INEC spokesperson, Sam Olumekun, the decision followed the receipt of the report from its committee reviewing the applications.

He said the decisions would be communicated to the respective association within 24 hours.

He said the commission received a total of 171 requests for registration.

“In addition to reviewing our preparations for forthcoming off-cycle governorship elections and the end-of-tenure Area Council election in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), the meeting also considered the report of its committee on the Review of Letters of Intent from associations seeking registration as political parties,” the statement said.

“Each request was assessed on the basis of its prima facie compliance with the provisions of Section 222 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), Section 79 (1, 2 and 4) of the Electoral Act 2022 and Clause 2 (i and ii) of the Commission’s Regulations and Guidelines for Political Parties 2022”.

Next steps

Mr Olumekun said the interim chairpersons and secretaries of the pre-qualified associations would be invited to a briefing on Wednesday 17 September at 11 a.m. at the INEC Headquarters in Abuja.

The associations will also be asked to upload certain information to INEC’s online portal.

The electoral commission will subsequently conduct physical verification for all claims by each association.

He said the final determination of the registrability of the associations as political parties will be made after the physical verification of all their claims to determine compliance with the legal framework.

“We wish to reiterate that party registration is a continuous process under the law. The Commission remains open to the consideration of applications that meet the criteria as provided by law,” he said.

The pre-qualified associations

The electoral commission also listed the 14 pre-qualified associations as African Transformation Party (ATP), All Democratic Alliance (ADA), Advance Nigeria Congress (ANC), Abundance Social Party (ASP), African Alliance Party (AAP), Citizens Democratic Alliance (CDA), and Democratic Leadership Alliance (DLA).

Others are: Grassroots Initiative Party (GRIP), Green Future Party (GFP), Liberation People’s Party (LPP), National Democratic Party (NDP), National Reform Party (NRP), Patriotic Peoples Alliance (PPA), and the Peoples Freedom Party (PFP)",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/820486-inec-disqualifies-157-aspiring-political-parties-invites-14-for-screening.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
NLC threatens to mobilise against NASS if Akpoti-Uduaghan is blocked from resuming,"The Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) has warned that it would mobilise its members against the National Assembly if the Kogi Central Senator, Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan, is not allowed to resume her legislative duties, having served her suspension period.

NLC President, Joe Ajaero, issued the warning in a statement on Thursday, condemning the decision to continue restraining Mrs Akpoti-Uduaghan.

“We warn the leadership of the National Assembly and their enablers: the Nigerian people, united across ethnic and religious lines, will not stand idly by while you cannibalise our democracy. The labour movement, as the historic defender of justice and the common good, will mobilise its immense membership and moral authority to resist this slide into autocracy. An attack on one senator today is an attack on the sovereignty of every Nigerian voter tomorrow,” he said.

The NLC, an umbrella body for trade unions in Nigeria, often channels public grievances through protests.

It is unclear whether the union plans to immediately mobilise demonstrations should the Senate persist in blocking Mrs Akpoti-Uduaghan’s resumption until the judicial process regarding her suspension is concluded.

Earlier this week, Mrs Akpoti-Uduaghan threatened to sue the Clerk to the National Assembly (CNA), Kamorudeen Ogunlana, if she is not allowed to resume by Monday. Her lawyer, Michael Numa (SAN), conveyed the threat in a letter dated 10 September.

Although the Senate has not issued an official resolution, there are indications that the upper chamber may block her resumption when lawmakers reconvene on 23 September because the matter is still before the court and deciding otherwise would be subjudice.

Assault to democracy

Mr Ajaero described the continued denial of Mrs Akpoti-Uduaghan’s resumption as a threat to Nigeria’s democracy.

“The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) rises in vehement condemnation of the Godswill Akpabio-led Senate’s decision to continue barring Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan from performing her sacred constitutional duties. This act is not merely an error in judgement; it is a brazen, premeditated assault on democracy itself, a direct threat to the social contract, and a dangerous slide towards fascism masquerading as governance,” he said.

He criticised the Senate for ignoring a court ruling that voided her suspension and for refusing her return even after the suspension had lapsed.

“That you suspended a fellow Senator from her constitutional roles depriving her people proper representation is not sinful enough but you went ahead to ignore the rulings of the Court that voided her suspension and at the expiration of your illegal suspension, you are still denying her a return is the height of impunity and morally reprehensible. This is no longer a democracy,” he stated.

Alleged manipulation of the judiciary

Mr Ajero also accused the Senate leadership of attempting to silence the opposition and manipulate the judiciary.

“The Senate’s pathetic recourse to a frivolous legal technicality, claiming the matter is sub judice, after the expiration of a patently illegal six-month suspension, is the height of legislative bad faith.

It is a cynical ploy that reveals a sinister agenda to silence dissent, crush opposition, and manipulate the judiciary as a tool of political persecution.

This action, led by Senator Akpabio, constitutes a gross abuse of power that shames the hallowed chambers of the National Assembly and spits on the collective will of the people of Kogi Central who elected Senator Akpoti-Uduaghan.

“From our standpoint, this action is a direct attack on the Nigerian people. It is a declaration by a privileged political elite that they are not accountable to the citizens they purport to serve.

By willfully disenfranchising an entire senatorial district, the Senate is effectively stealing the political representation for which the people pay taxes.

This denies Kogi Central its right to participate in lawmaking, oversight, and the appropriation of national resources, directly impoverishing the constituents and perpetuating a system of exclusion and economic injustice. It signals to all Nigerians that their votes are meaningless and can be invalidated by the whims of any tyrannical leadership.

“The NLC stands on the side of democracy and wishes to state that this action is: a calculated test-run for the emasculation of opposition and the subjugation of sovereign will as 2027 approaches. It is an attempt to punish integrity and honour and hound men and women of conscience out of the political space.

A Senate that operates as a court in its matter, suspends members, and then ignores the expiry of its own sanctions, is a Senate that has declared war on the very principles of representative democracy and on our nation,” the NLC chairman said.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/820482-nlc-threatens-to-mobilise-against-nass-if-akpoti-uduaghan-is-blocked-from-resuming.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"Akpoti-Uduaghan threatens to sue NASS Clerk, insists on resuming","The Kogi Central Senator, Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan, has threatened to sue the Clerk to the National Assembly (CNA), Kamorudeen Ogunlana, if she is not allowed to resume legislative duties by Monday.

The threat was conveyed in a letter dated 10 September and addressed to the Clerk by her lawyer, Michael Numa (SAN).

The lawyer demanded that the senator be allowed to resume her duties without obstruction, warning that failure to comply would result in legal action.

“Take notice that failure to comply by Monday, 15th September 2025, will leave us with no alternative but to initiate proceedings against you personally and in your official capacity,” the letter reads.

The lawyer said the suit would focus on the clerk’s alleged refusal to obey a subsisting court judgment and his breach of the Code of Conduct for Public Officers.

He thereafter advised the clerk to reconsider his stance and allow the senator to resume without any hindrance.

“Such proceedings will include, but are not limited to: Committal for contempt; Disciplinary action for breach of the Code of Conduct for Public Officers; Liability for instigating breach of the peace with potential implications for national security; and any other remedies available to our client under the law.

“We strongly advise that you reconsider your untenable stance and comply with the Constitution and extant judicial orders,“ the letter added.

The lawyer’s threat followed a letter addressed to Mrs Akpoti-Uduaghan by the Acting Clerk to the National Assembly, Yahaya Danzaria, informing her that she could not resume because the matter of her suspension is in court, and that her return can only follow a Senate review or the conclusion of the judicial process.

Multiple sources told PREMIUM TIMES that Mr Danzaria acted in the Clerk’s capacity because Mr Ogunlana is currently out of the country.

Mrs Akpoti-Uduaghan had earlier written to the National Assembly, notifying it of her intention to resume following the expiration of her six-month suspension.

Although the Senate has not issued an official resolution, there are indications that the upper chamber may block her resumption when lawmakers reconvene on 23 September because the matter is still before the court and deciding otherwise would be sub judice.

Lawyer’s arguement

In the letter, Mrs Akpoti-Uduaghan’s counsel argued that the NASS Clerk exceeded his constitutional authority.

“As Clerk of the National Assembly, you are not an elected member of the Senate. Your functions are purely ministerial: to record, transmit, and implement decisions duly made by the Senate or directed by the courts. To the best of our client’s knowledge, no Senate resolution exists extending our client’s suspension or imposing any new sanction for the same alleged misconduct.

“Your letter fails to disclose on whose directive you purported to act. By assuming powers you do not possess, you have acted ultra vires, and placed both yourself personally and your office in contempt of the Constitution and binding judicial orders.”

What the court said

In July, Binta Nyako, a judge of the Federal High Court, ruled in her favour, holding that suspending an elected lawmaker for six months amounts to denying her constituents their right to representation.

However, the court did not order her immediate reinstatement. Instead, Mrs Nyako issued an advisory opinion urging the Senate to reconsider the suspension.

In a separate ruling, the court found Mrs Akpoti-Uduaghan guilty of civil contempt over a satirical social media post deemed disrespectful to the court. She was fined N5 million and ordered to publish a public apology in two national newspapers and on her Facebook page within seven days.

She has since appealed the judgement.

Appeal

Dissatisfied with the ruling, the Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, filed a cross-appeal at the Court of Appeal on 11 July.

Through his counsel, Kehinde Ogunwumiju, SAN, Mr Akpabio argued that the Federal High Court erred in law and exceeded its powers by intervening in the Senate’s internal disciplinary process.

The appeal, which raises 11 grounds, contends that the court lacked jurisdiction as the Senate Committee on Ethics, Code of Conduct, and Public Petitions had not completed its investigation before the case was filed.

Mr Akpabio further argued that Mrs Akpoti-Uduaghan failed to exhaust internal dispute resolution mechanisms provided under the Senate Standing Orders before seeking judicial intervention, rendering her suit premature.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/820436-akpoti-uduaghan-threatens-to-sue-nass-clerk-insists-on-resuming.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Court resumes stalled trial of 2011 UN House bombing suspects,"The long-delayed trial of Khalid al-Barnawi, a suspected mastermind of the 2011 bombing of the United Nations building in Abuja, resumed on Friday at the Federal High Court in Abuja.

The attack, which occurred on 26 August in 2011, left at least 20 people dead and more than 70 others injured.

Mr Al-Barnawi is standing trial alongside four co-defendants accused of being involved in the bombing.

The co-defendants are Mohammed Bashir Saleh, Umar Mohammed Bello (also known as Datti), Mohammed Salisu and Yakubu Nuhu (also known as Bello Maishayi).

Mr Al-Barnawi, the prime suspect, was also accused of being a member of Ansaru, a Boko Haram breakaway faction said to be ideologically aligned with al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).

At Friday’s hearing, prosecution lawyer Alex Iziyon, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), expressed commitment to the expeditious determination of the case. while applying to the court to grant accelerated hearing.

The application also included the prosecution’s request to present video evidence during trial to show that the extrajudicial statements of the suspects were voluntarily obtained from the defendants, contrary to their claims of coercion.

Trial judge Emeka Nwite granted the prosecution’s application in a ruling on Friday.

In August 2011, terrorists bombed the United Nations House in the Central District of Garki, Abuja. The attack killed and injured many people.

Boko Haram claimed responsibility in a phone call with BBC, the Guardian UK reported. Its spokesperson, Abu Qaqa, said the UN was targeted because it represented Western influence in Nigeria.

In April 2016, Mr Al-Barnawi was arrested by the State Security Service (SSS) operatives in Lokoja, Kogi State.

The Nigerian government charged him and his co-defendants who were also arrested by the security agency, accusing them of carrying out terrorist attacks between 2011 and 2013 in Sokoto, Kebbi, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe and other northern states.

However, the trial has suffered incessant and prolonged adjournments, partly due to absence of the defendants or their lawyers from court on many occasions.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/820681-court-resumes-stalled-trial-of-2011-un-house-bombing-suspects.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"Air Peace reacts to report that its pilots tested positive to alcohol, cannabis","Air Peace says the Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau (NSIB) has not communicated to it the bureau’s findings on the airline’s Port Harcourt runway incident in Rivers State.

The NSIB had launched a probe into the 13 July 2025 incident in an aircraft belonging to Air Peace veered off the runway after landing at the Port Harcourt International

PREMIUM TIMES reported that in a preliminary report released Friday, the NSIB said toxicology tests confirmed the presence of intoxicants in the captain and first officer who flew the Boeing 737 with 103 people on board.

The aircraft, with registration 5N-BQQ, was flying a scheduled Lagos–Port Harcourt service when it landed long on Runway 21.

Air Peace, Nigeria’s largest airline, operates domestic and international flights across Africa and to destinations such as London, Saudi Arabia, Dakar, Freetown, Monrovia, and Ghana.

Zero tolerance for alcohol, drug use

Reacting to NSIB’s findings on Friday, Air Peace said in a statement that it does not tolerate alcohol and drug use, adding that it conducts frequent tests on crew members.

“To date, we have never received any official communications from the NSIB on such findings over a month after the incident and after the testing of the crew for alcohol, which took place in less than an hour of the incident,” the airline said.

“Air Peace conducts frequent alcohol and drug tests on our crew. We have a very strict alcohol use policy that is stricter than the 8 hours before the flight as provided in the regulations. Drug use is a NO-NO!”

The airline also said the captain of the affected flight was immediately grounded and relieved of flying duties—not because of an alcohol test result, but for failing to adhere to crew resource management principles and disregarding his co-pilot’s advice to execute a go-around.

It said the first officer, who called for the go-around, had been cleared by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority and reinstated to active duties.

“If he was involved in drug or alcohol use, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority would not have cleared him to resume flight duties,” Air Peace said.

“However, if the sacked captain tested positive on the breathalyser test, then we must increase the frequency of our alcohol and drug tests on our crew.

“Again, the importance of Enhanced Crew Resource Management Training cannot be overemphasised.”

The airline said it will step up the frequency of its crew drug and alcohol testing, as well as strengthen internal monitoring and fitness-for-duty checks to reinforce its zero-tolerance safety policy.

Air Peace said it has consistently maintained a strong safety record and strictly implements global best practices in all aspects of its operations, and reassured passengers and the public that safety will never be compromised.

The International Civil Aviation Organisation considers intoxication by flight crew a serious breach of safety standards.

Several airlines worldwide have faced scandals in recent years after pilots were caught under the influence of alcohol, underscoring the risks to passenger safety.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/820674-air-peace-reacts-to-report-that-its-pilots-tested-positive-to-alcohol-cannabis.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Abuja hospitals offer skeletal services as doctors’ strike continues,"The Association of Resident Doctors in the Federal Capital Territory (ARD-FCT) embarked on a seven-day warning strike on 8 September, citing the government’s failure to resolve long-standing grievances.

In a communiqué signed by ARD-FCT President George Egbong and other executives, the doctors listed lack of manpower, poor welfare, unpaid salaries, unexplained deductions, the psychological toll of long working hours, and the absence of new recruitment in FCT hospitals since 2011 as key issues.

The strike is scheduled to run until 15 September, after which the doctors said they would review their action based on the government’s response.

PREMIUM TIMES’ checks at health facilities in Abuja on Tuesday showed patients are heavily bearing the brunt of the industrial action, with several departments shut down and only emergency cases being attended to.

A follow-up visit on Friday, the fifth day of the strike, revealed that skeletal services were still ongoing. Outpatient departments were largely deserted, but nurses, consultants, and a few medical officers were attending to emergencies and critical cases.

Maitama and Asokoro Hospitals

PREMIUM TIMES observed a partial service delivery at both Maitama and Asokoro district hospitals.

In both hospitals, antenatal care (ANC) services were unaffected, but other services were halted.

A pregnant woman who came for ANC at the Maitama hospital, Peace Michael, told PREMIUM TIMES she was aware of the doctor’s strike, but noted it didn’t affect the ANC she came for.

Nwankwo Bright, who accompanied his wife to the hospital for ANC, also said they were being attended to.

“That (strike) didn’t affect my being here because I wasn’t scheduled to meet with doctors. It was the Nurses —those in charge of antenatal care- who attended to us,” he said.

PREMIUM TIMES gathered that the hospital has shut down most services and stopped admitting patients.

At the Asokoro hospital, a researcher at the internal medicine department said the hospital discharged all patients before the doctor’s strike and that there are no patients on admission throughout the duration of the strike.

Uzurame Samuel, who came to get a medical report for her son who is resuming in secondary school, said someone had attended to her.

Mrs Samuel said she gave birth to her two boys at the Asokoro hospital and was surprised at the scanty environment that greeted her on Friday morning.

“When I came, the place was not crowded. I didn’t even know that they were on strike. I was surprised that the place was so scanty. I’m not seeing doctors around like before. I thought they had done some reforms,” she said.

Karshi General Hospital

Unlike the near-empty wards in Maitama and Asokoro, Karshi General Hospital maintained limited operations.

Departments apart from the doctors’ clinics were still running, including antenatal registration and laboratory services.

A woman who came for antenatal registration told PREMIUM TIMES she was able to complete the process.

However, she explained that patients requiring consultations with doctors would have to wait until the strike is called off.

“If you want to register for antenatal, you can go there. If you want to do tests, you can go, but you won’t be able to see the doctor,” she said.

Last resort

In an interview with PREMIUM TIMES on Thursday, ARD-FCT President Mr Egbong described the strike as a “last resort” after repeated appeals to the FCT Administration failed.

He noted that many hospitals in the territory are struggling with depleted manpower and worsening working conditions, which he said have left doctors “overstretched and demoralised.”

“We cannot continue to work under these conditions without putting our own health and the safety of patients at risk,” he said.

He stressed that the association was open to dialogue if authorities demonstrated a genuine commitment.

National level

The situation in Abuja mirrors wider tensions in the health sector, as the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) has also renewed pressure on the federal government.

On Thursday, the national body gave the government a fresh 24-hour ultimatum to meet its demands, following the expiration of an earlier 10-day deadline on 10 September.

In a communiqué issued after its extraordinary national executive council meeting on Wednesday, NARD warned that failure to act would result in a five-day nationwide warning strike from Friday, 12 September.

Among its grievances are the non-payment of five months’ arrears from the 25/35 per cent Consolidated Medical Salary Structure (CONMESS) review, delayed release of the 2025 Medical Residency Training Fund (MRTF), and downgrading of membership certificates from the West African Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons by the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria.

The association also condemned state governments that have failed to pay the MRTF, describing the situation as “gross insensitivity.”

The resident doctors comprise the bulk of medical personnel in Nigeria’s tertiary hospitals; hence, healthcare services are often crippled when they embark on strike.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/820645-abuja-hospitals-offer-skeletal-services-as-doctors-strike-continues.html,https://premiumtimesng.com

Emir appoints Bashir Dabo ‘Maga Isan Zazzau’,"The Emir of Zazzau, Ahmed Nuhu-Bamalli, will turban Bashir Ibrahim-Dabo as the ‘Maga Isan Zazzau’ of the Zazzau Emirate in Kaduna State on Saturday, 13 September.

The emirate council said the ceremony, being held under a series of events that began on Friday at the emir’s palace and other places in Zaria, will be attended by dignitaries, including the Governor of Kaduna State, Uba Sani.

Mr Ibrahim-Dabo was an assistant registrar at the Federal College of Education, Zaria, until he was appointed by former Governor Nasir El Rufai as special assistant on New Media. He later served at the Nigerian Ports Authority as the personal assistant to the Managing Director/CEO, Hadiza Bala Usman, from 2016 to 2022.

He currently works with the Special Adviser to President Bola Tinubu on Policy and Coordination, and as the Head of the Central Results Delivery and Coordination Unit under Ms Bala-Usman.

Who is Ibrahim Dabo?

Mr Ibrahim-Dabo was born on 14 September 1985. His father’s maternal line came from the lineage of Wazirin Sokoto Gidado. He is a prince from the genealogy of the second Fulani emir of Zazzau, Malam Yamusa, the founder of the Bare-Bari ruling clan through the Grand Vizier of Shehu Usman Danfodio.

Mr Ibrahim-Dabo is an alumnus of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science (Hons) degree in International Studies in 2008.

He holds two master’s degrees in International Business and Management from the University of Bedfordshire, Luton, United Kingdom, and a master’s in International Affairs and Diplomacy from ABU, Zaria.

He is a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Public Administrators of Nigeria and a member of the Board of Trustees of the Ibrahim Dabo Centre for Entrepreneurship and Community Development.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/820603-emir-appoints-bashir-dabo-maga-isan-zazzau.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Elected local council chairpersons in Rivers not APC members – Official,"A factional spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Darlington Nwauju, has disowned candidates of the party elected in the just concluded chairmanship and councilorship elections in the South-south state.

Mr Nwauju spoke on Thursday night when he appeared as a guest on Channels TV’s Politics Today.

PREMIUM TIMES earlier reported that the APC won a majority of seats in the 30 August local elections in Rivers State, securing 20 out of the 23 councils, while the PDP won in three.

But Mr Nwauju claimed the 20 candidates elected as local council chairpersons under the APC platform are not members of the party.

“The thing I can say to you now and here is the fact that those persons are not members of the APC,” he said, referring to the 20 elected chairpersons.

The factional spokesperson argued that the elected chairpersons were not “duly nominated by the legitimate” leadership of the APC in Rivers State which has two factions.

Is Wike in charge of the APC in Rivers?

Mr Nwauju, on the TV show, refuted the claim that the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Nyesom Wike, is in charge of the APC in the South-south state.

APC or PDP?

Mr Wike is officially a member of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) although he serves in the APC administration of President Bola Tinubu.

The FCT minister has been accused of deliberately sabotaging the PDP to the benefit of the Tinubu administration, but has always maintained that he is a loyal member and benefactor of the PDP.

The former Rivers governor has repeatedly vowed never to leave the PDP, despite serving in the APC administration.

‘Not aware’

Seun Okinbaloye, the programme anchor, asked Mr Nwauju if it was true that Mr Wike was now in charge of the APC in Rivers State.

“I am not aware. What I am aware of is the fact that he is not a member of the APC,” he responded.

The official suggested that the FCT minister had yet to apply to be a member of the APC and cannot be in charge of a party of which he is not a member.

Background

The APC in Rivers State has been battling an intense leadership crisis in the state.

Two factions of the party in the state are laying claim to leadership.

Tony Okocha leads one faction while Emeka Beke heads another faction of the party where Mr Nwauju belongs.

While Mr Okocha’s faction has the backing of the APC national leadership and Mr Wike, Mr Beke’s faction enjoys the support of a former governor of Rivers State, Rotimi Amaechi, who is now leading an opposition with a coalition of other politicians against President Bola Tinubu from the African Democratic Congress.

Mr Okocha was elected chairperson of the APC in Rivers State during the party’s congress in November 2024.

But a high court in Port-Harcourt, Rivers State, in December 2024, nullified the election of Mr Okocha as APC chairperson.

The judge, Godwin Obomanu, ruled that the congress was held in utter disrespect of a court order issued on 21 November 2024 which ordered that the congress be halted.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/south-south-regional/820586-elected-local-council-chairpersons-in-rivers-not-apc-members-official.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
CAF marks 100 days to kick-off of AFCON 2025 in Morocco,"The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has officially launched the 100-day countdown to the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Morocco, promising another historic celebration of African football when the continent gathers from 21 December to 18 January 2026.

For the first time in 37 years, Morocco will host Africa’s biggest sporting event, providing world-class facilities across nine stadiums in six cities—Rabat, Casablanca, Fès, Tangier, Marrakech, and Agadir.

The Kingdom, which recently staged the 2024 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations and the 2025 U-17 AFCON, is expected to deliver a spectacle that reflects both its passion for football and its rising global status as a host nation.

The competition, which will be the 35th edition since its launch in 1957, is projected to surpass the records set by the hugely successful 2023 AFCON in Côte d’Ivoire.

That tournament drew a global television audience of more than 1.5 billion and racked up 2.4 billion digital streams, underlining the growing global appetite for African football. Côte d’Ivoire will arrive in Morocco as the defending champions.

CAF marked the milestone by unveiling a commemorative countdown poster, underscoring its commitment to building momentum ahead of kick-off.

The tournament also comes as Morocco gears up to co-host the 2030 FIFA World Cup alongside Spain and Portugal, cementing its place at the heart of world football.

Super Eagles set sights on history

For Nigeria’s Super Eagles, the 2025 edition offers another chance to end their decade-long wait for a continental crown.

The three-time champions came agonisingly close at the last AFCON in Côte d’Ivoire, reaching the final before losing 2–1 to the host nation in Abidjan.

Drawn in Group C alongside Tunisia, Uganda, and Tanzania, Nigeria faces a mix of familiar and rising opposition. Tunisia, themselves former champions, have a strong tradition at the tournament, while Uganda and Tanzania arrive as ambitious underdogs seeking to make a mark. For the Eagles, topping the group will be crucial to building momentum toward the knockout rounds, where the real test of champions begins.

With the World Cup ticket increasingly looking out of reach, the tournament in Morocco provides a platform for the Nigerian players to fall back on.

With names like Ahmed Musa and Kenneth Omeruo no longer in the Super Eagles set up, players like Victor Osimhen, Ademola Lookman, and Alex Iwobi are yet to experience winning Africa’s biggest football title.

From its iconic stadiums to its rich cultural experiences, the host nation is positioning AFCON 2025 as a global showcase of Africa’s talent, passion, and unity.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/820652-caf-marks-100-days-to-kick-off-of-afcon-2025-in-morocco.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Plateau governor flags off 400-unit housing estate for civil servants,"The Plateau State Governor, Caleb Mutfwang, has inaugurated the construction of a 400-unit housing estate in Zanwra, Miango District of the Bassa Local Government Area, as part of efforts to reduce accommodation challenges faced by civil servants in the state.

The project, which forms part of a broader 2,000-unit workers’ housing scheme, is described by the state government as a major step in its commitment to the welfare of civil servants and sustainable development.

Gyang Bere, director of press and public affairs to the governor, in a statement on Thursday, said the initiative goes beyond building houses but represents “hope, dignity, and stability” for Plateau’s workforce.

Mr Bere quoted the governor as saying the initiative is a deliberate social and welfare strategy designed to prioritise civil servants, whom he described as “the true and reliable pillars of good governance.”

Governor Mutfwang recalled reforms carried out since his assumption of office, including clearing months of accumulated salary arrears, paying decades-old pension and gratuity backlogs, raising pensions by up to 100 per cent, and approving the new ₦70,000 minimum wage for Plateau civil servants.

He further disclosed that the government acquired 38.3 hectares of land in Zanwra for the project for ₦346.5 million, which has been fully paid to enable a smooth take-off.

“Housing is not a privilege; it is a right. A decent home provides comfort, security, and a stable foundation for a dignified life,” the governor was quoted as saying. “With this project, we are not just building houses; we are creating homes, communities, and enduring legacies.”

The state chairperson of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Eugene Manji, commended the government for reviving the workers’ housing scheme and settling the land acquisition cost. He assured that construction by GST Group International Limited would begin immediately, with visible progress expected within two months.

Stephen Pam, the head of civil service, said allocation of the houses would be fair and transparent, taking into account years of service, income brackets, and contributions to the National Housing Fund.

On his part, a representative of the developers, Christopher Nathaniel of DSK Group of Companies, pledged that the estate would meet high standards of design and durability. He said the facility would include solar power, clean water, schools, clinics, and recreational spaces, while creating over 3,000 jobs in the process.

The state chairperson of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), Kenneth Shamma, urged the government to provide alternative routes to link the estate to the city centre. The traditional ruler of Irigwe land, Ronku Aka, lauded the governor’s development strides and called for improved security in the area.

The event ended with Governor Mutfwang laying the foundation stone, which the government described as a symbolic step towards addressing the housing deficit for Plateau civil servants.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/north-central/820583-plateau-governor-flags-off-400-unit-housing-estate-for-civil-servants.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
FLASHBACK: How I met Temi–Mr Eazi,"An old but golden interview of Nigerian singer and music executive Oluwatosin Ajibade, popularly known as Mr Eazi, is trending again.

Fans have revisited the 2018 chat with Ghana’s Delay TV, where he first revealed how he met his now-wife, Temi Otedola.

In the conversation resurfacing seven years later, Mr Eazi, 34, said, “I met Temi at an event her sister invited me to. Her sister was the DJ at the event. By the time Temi came to the table, her sister was already playing, so obviously we had to socialise. Suddenly, it was just me and Temi. I knew she was DJ Cuppy’s sister because the table was reserved for family and invitees, and I could see the resemblance.

‘‘I just knew I was talking to my friend’s sister. I didn’t know how much her father was worth then; I just saw a fine girl. I had never dated any popular lady or actress before Temi. I was always into people I connected with. Before Temi, my exes were from Eritrea and Nigeria. Work made me meet people from different backgrounds. Temi was not the first rich girl I met, and I don’t have a type,” the singer said.

Family acceptance

In the interview, the singer said he received a warm welcome from Temi’s family, including her billionaire father, Femi Otedola. Mr Eazi explained that Otedola’s belief in destiny and recognition of his own hard work helped pave the way for their relationship’s acceptance.

“The last time we had dinner, Mr. Femi Otedola, Temi’s father, already knew where my mind was. He believes strongly in destiny, and if you check his page, you will see him speak about it often; that you can’t fight destiny.

“If you are meant to meet someone, you will meet that person. He was not trying to bargain with me. He knows I am a good guy. The family is not like that, and Temi herself is not like that. That is why we are together. The Otedola family is not the typical rich family; they do normal things.”

Mr Eazi added that their acceptance was not just about making Temi happy, but a genuine endorsement of the couple’s love and shared values.

Dream wedding

While responding to questions about the type of wedding he fantasised about having with his lover, the songwriter said he imagined having a simple wedding with a maximum of 50 people.

“I always fantasised about weddings in quiet, coded places like an island, with just family and friends. Maximum 50 people. I like simple, romantic settings with flowers and candles, where no cameras are allowed. That has always been my idea of a wedding.”

Fast forward to 2025, Oluwatosin married Temi in three wedding ceremonies that took place in three countries. The first wedding happened on 9 May 2025, in Monaco.

It was a private ceremony at the Marie de Monaco town hall, with just four people present: the couple, Temi’s assistant, and one of Eazi’s friends.

About two months later, the couple held a traditional Yoruba wedding at the Otedola family home in Dubai, while the grand finale came on 8 August 2025, in Iceland.

Zero pressure

Also, Oluwatosin stated clearly that he had never felt any pressure to impress his girlfriend, Temi. He added that Temi appreciated his time and efforts rather than expensive gifts.

“Temi once came with me to Tamale for a water project. Unlike what people think, she takes buses and trains, and she even walks more than I do. I am the one who usually orders Uber.”

He, however, refuted claims that his girlfriend, Temi, invested her finances in his music. The singer said, “She does not invest her money in my music, because that is not the kind of support we need. We are doing well, and not in a negative way.

“Her way of showing love does not put pressure on me to impress her. At the end of the day, you have to know the person you are with. She would rather appreciate a handwritten card or a rose.

“The biggest gift I can give her is to write a card. She prefers me spending time with her, maybe going to the cinema, rather than spending money on bags. For her, time is more valuable. I am in love with her, and I hope it goes as far as possible,” Oluwatosin said.

He added that he was worth more than $1 million to prove that he is doing well for himself, not by the investment of his girlfriend in his music.

Mr Otedola, in his speech at his daughter’s wedding, also attested to Oluwatosin’s words of 2018 at his daughter’s wedding, claiming he knew the singer would be Temi’s husband the first day he saw him.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/entertainment/naija-fashion/820561-flashback-how-i-met-temi-mr-eazi.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
How to end insurgency in Nigeria – Ndume,"Borno South Senator, Ali Ndume, has said terrorism, banditry, and insurgency can only be defeated if the military and other security agencies are adequately funded.

Mr Ndume, a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), stated this in a statement on Thursday while reacting to calls for the removal of service chiefs.

“Those pushing for sack of the present crop of Service Chiefs have ulterior motive and they do not mean well for the present administration and Nigerians. I want to restate my call for a proactive TEAM approach. Which means Training, Equipment, Ammunitions and Motivation. This combination would go a long to counter terrorism, banditry and insurgency,” he said.

The senator stressed that security personnel require proper weapons and welfare to end insecurity in the country.

“All they need is adequate ammunitions and motivation. The salary of a private in the army in Nigeria is about N100,000.00 ($67.00) per month. Their daily allowance ( N5,000.00) is unconscionable and nothing to write home about,” he added.

Mr Ndume himself was once charged in court in 2011 over alleged links to Boko Haram militants but was cleared in 2017.

For more than a decade, Nigeria has battled terrorism and banditry, especially in the North. Entire communities have been shattered, families torn apart, and livelihoods destroyed.

The North-east continues to suffer Boko Haram/ISWAP attacks, while the North-west and Middle Belt face repeated attacks from banditry and several kidnapping incidents.

Recent data shows fatalities are rising. In the first half of 2025, at least 2,266 people were killed by insurgents and bandits, compared to 1,083 in the same period of 2024. However, abductions declined, with 857 cases recorded between January and June 2025, down from 1,461 in the same period last year.

"Tony Elumelu, Timothy Dolan to receive 2025 Appeal of Conscience Award","Nigerian businessman and philanthropist, Tony Elumelu, and the Archbishop of New York, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, will be honoured with the Appeal of Conscience Award at the 60th Annual Gala of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation.

The award is scheduled to take place on 29 September at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City.

The Award, presented annually by the Appeal of Conscience Foundation (ACF), recognises individuals whose leadership embodies tolerance, religious freedom, and human dignity.

Founded in 1965 by a Jewish Rabbi, Arthur Schneier, the ACF is an interfaith alliance of religious, business, and political leaders committed to promoting peace and mutual understanding around the world.

In a statement on its website, the foundation praised Mr Dolan and Mr Elumelu as “moral leaders who exemplify the spirit of conscience and compassion in public life.”

“Inspiring voices in faith and business”

Speaking on Mr Dolan’s selection, Mr Schneier described the Catholic leader as a figure of “wisdom, vision, and compassion” who has earned the respect of communities across the US.

“He practices what he preaches,” he added. “In a fractured world, he is a steadfast leader inspiring unity over division.”

Mr Dolan has served as Archbishop of New York since 2009 and was appointed Cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012. He participated in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Pope Francis and the 2025 conclave that selected Pope Leo XIV. A former president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, the priest is widely regarded as a global advocate for religious liberty and interfaith cooperation.

Reacting to the announcement, Mr Dolan expressed gratitude for the honour.

“To receive this recognition from the Appeal of Conscience Foundation is both moving and profoundly meaningful,” he said. “Our shared commitment to peace, mutual respect, and the sacred value of every human life binds us across faith lines.”

Tony Elumelu’s “Africapitalism” recognised.

Mr Elumelu, chairperson of Heirs Holdings and the United Bank for Africa (UBA), was praised for his role in promoting ethical business practices and youth empowerment across Africa.

“Tony Elumelu stands as a beacon of ethical entrepreneurship and visionary leadership,” Mr Schneier said. “His commitment to uplifting others is a living example of conscience in action.”

Through the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF), the businessman has supported over 24,000 entrepreneurs across all 54 African countries with funding, mentorship, and training.

His philosophy of Africapitalism, which champions the role of the private sector in driving social and economic development, has garnered international acclaim.

TEF’s $100 million commitment to entrepreneurship, as well as environmental initiatives like BeGreen Africa, have impacted hundreds of thousands across the continent.

Heirs Holdings’ 15-Year Impact Report revealed that its corporate social responsibility programmes have directly impacted over 500,000 people in Africa.

In his acceptance statement, Mr Elumelu said the award serves as a reminder that leadership must be rooted in service.

“This recognition strengthens my resolve to continue empowering the next generation and building bridges of hope and prosperity across the globe,” the businessman said.

Gala to be chaired by Bank of America CEO

This year’s gala will be chaired by Brian Moynihan, chairman and CEO of Bank of America and a previous recipient of the Appeal of Conscience Award.

“Cardinal Dolan and Tony Elumelu personify the moral leadership and global responsibility that the Foundation stands for,” Mr Moynihan said.

“Their work reminds us that progress and conscience go hand in hand.”

UPDATED: Nigeria expresses ‘deep concern’ about Israeli airstrike in Qatar,"The Nigerian government has stopped short of condemning the Israeli attack on a residential area in Qatar, but expressed “deep concerns” about it and described the attack as a violation of international law.

According to a statement on Wednesday, the Nigerian government expressed “deep concerns” about the attack, which targeted top Hamas officials residing at the residential headquarters in Doha, the capital city.

Nigeria’s foreign affairs ministry said in the statement that the attack poses grave concerns for regional stability in the Middle East.

PREMIUM TIMES reported that Israel attacked the Qatari capital on Tuesday.

The Israeli military confirmed that it carried out the attack and that it was an assassination attempt on top Hamas leaders in the Qatari capital.

Israel claimed that the targeted Hamas members led the organisation’s activities for years, and that it will continue to act to “defeat the Hamas terrorist organisation.”

Following the attack, Qatar, which has been hosting direct and indirect mediation talks between Hamas and Israel, suspended its mediation efforts with both countries.

In its statement shared on X, the Nigerian government reiterated that the “development raises serious questions about regional stability and the prospects for ongoing diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the conflict.”

“Nigeria underscores the primacy of respecting the sovereignty of all nations and adhering to international law, particularly in matters involving the use of force across borders.

“Nigeria acknowledges Qatar’s longstanding role in fostering dialogue and mediation in the region,” it added.

Gov Lawal supports local businesses in Zamfara with over N1bn,"Governor Dauda Lawal has assured local entrepreneurs that Zamfara State is on a new path and is making significant strides, transforming from a state once dominated by challenges. The governor gave the assurance while inaugurating the distribution of grants under the SABER (SERBS) programme on Thursday at the JB Yakubu Secretariat, Gusau.

A statement by the governor’s spokesperson, Sulaiman Bala Idris, revealed that the State Action on Business Enabling Reforms (SABER) Programme represents a landmark in the state’s economic renewal. The statement added that SABER is a five-year, performance-based, multi-sectoral initiative supported by the World Bank, carefully designed to dismantle barriers, stimulate private enterprise, and generate sustainable jobs for the people of Zamfara.

N150,000 will be distributed to 2,000 beneficiaries across the state to support nano and micro businesses. Additionally, 1,000 individuals in small and medium-sized businesses will receive N500,000 each. Furthermore, 60 people from medium—and large-scale businesses will benefit from a grant of N5 million each.

In his remarks, Governor Lawal noted that SABER is not an ordinary intervention, affirming that the total amount allocated for the disbursement component of the programme is approximately N1.1 billion, with funding support ranging from $20 million USD to $52 million USD between 2022 and 2026.

“We are gathered today to launch the programme with the commencement of the disbursement of money to support various categories of businessmen and women throughout the state. “There are three main categories of disbursements to be made. We have carefully reviewed relevant government institutions and the private sector, represented by the Chamber of Commerce leadership, to select beneficiaries in each support category,” he added.

Governor Lawal further stressed that the SABER programme, coordinated by the Ministry of Budget and Planning, is implemented by various MDAs, including the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, ZAGIS, and others like Finance, Agriculture, and Justice. It also involves the Internal Revenue Service, Housing Corporation, and ZITDA, working in conjunction with the Ease of Doing Business Committee.

Earlier, the CEO/Director General of Nigeria’s Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency (SMEDAN), Charles Odii, commended Governor Lawal for his numerous efforts to support local businesses in Zamfara State. “I am glad that His Excellency the governor is not paying lip service to developing small businesses in Nigeria. I was sitting there, hearing that 2,000 businesses will get N150,000. I think it is important that if a small business owner gets N150,000, he will employ one person.”",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/promoted/820614-gov-lawal-supports-local-businesses-in-zamfara-with-over-n1bn.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"Gov Abiodun appoints 1,200 political aides to strengthen grassroots democracy in Ogun","In fulfillment of its commitment to deepen democratic participation and broaden access to the dividends of democracy, the Ogun State Government has appointed 1,200 political assistants to serve as change agents and enhance civic engagement across the state.

Announcing the initiative in a statement, the Special Adviser on Media and Strategy to Governor Dapo Abiodun, Kayode Akinmade, described the move as a strategic effort to strengthen democratic governance across all nooks and crannies of the state.

According to him, the assistants — five from each of the 236 wards in Ogun State — will ensure greater local participation in governance, effectively bridging the gap between the grassroots and the state government.

“The newly appointed political assistants are to support the delivery of democratic dividends, articulate the needs of their respective wards, and communicate these needs to the state government.

They are also expected to provide accurate feedback from the government to the wards and vice versa,” he stated.

Mr Akinmade emphasised that this initiative fulfills Governor Dapo Abiodun’s electoral promise to carry every ward along in his administration’s development programmes and to run an all-inclusive government that values the people’s inputs in shaping policies and initiatives.

The state government further urged the new appointees to contribute significantly to the growth and development of their wards, local governments, and the state at large.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/promoted/820611-gov-abiodun-appoints-1200-political-aides-to-strengthen-grassroots-democracy-in-ogun.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Tenth edition of Nigeria Mining Week to feature exciting new industry forums,"The upcoming Nigeria Mining Weekconference and expo will feature exciting new forums to engage mining houses, sector specialists and investors specifically on matters such as steel, gold, gemstones and power. In addition, the Kaduna State Deal Room, Quarrying Forum and Women in Extractive Industries Forum are expected to gather high-profile mining dignitaries as the event celebrates its 10th edition when it returns to Abuja from 13 to 15 October. This year’s event theme is: “Nigeria Mining: From Progress to Global Relevance.”

The event is hosted by Ministry of Solid Mineral Development of Nigeria andorganised by Miners Association of Nigeria, in partnership with PwC Nigeria and VUKA Group.

Platform for shaping conversation

Says Habeeb Jaiyeola, Partner and Head, Mining Sector, PricewaterhouseCoopers(PwC) Nigeria: “Over the past decade, this annual event has served as the foremost platform for shaping the conversation on Nigeria’s mining sector—driving dialogue, building consensus and crafting solutions that position mining as a true engine of shared prosperity for all Nigerians.”

He adds: “This year’s edition, themed “Nigeria Mining: From Progress to Global Relevance”, is designed to showcase the milestones achieved in Nigeria’s mining sector to both local stakeholders and the international community. At the same time, it provides a critical forum for addressing current challenges and developing actionable solutions that will unlock the sector’s full potential for growth, inclusivity and global competitiveness.”

Catalyst for progress

“The 10th edition of Nigeria Mining Weekis a key milestone for the industry and reflects the increasing maturity of the country’s extractive sector,” says VUKA Group Event Director for Mining Samukelo Madlabane. “The traditional 10th-anniversary gift is tin and aluminium, symbolising the flexibility and durability of a lasting relationship. How very apt that Nigeria has abundant tin reserves, primarily located in the Jos Plateau, and is a major exporter of tin ore. Moreover, the country is a significant consumer and processor of aluminium.”

“Networking and dealmaking”

“An important function of the event has always been to maximise sharing, dealmaking and networking between our attendees,” Madlabane continues “We are therefore excited to introduce several new features in the programme to enable all the different sectors and specialists to have specific gatherings to brainstorm and inspire each other.”

The new forums include the following:

– Kaduna Mining Development Company(KMDC) Deal Room

Nigeria Mining Week has always been a prime deal-making gathering for the industry. This year, a dedicated Deal Room, exclusively sponsored by the Kaduna Mining Development Company, will provide a private venue to connect directly with top investors, project owners and industry leaders ready to negotiate and seal transformative agreements on the spot. The Kaduna Deal Room will offer a premium, confidential space designed to spark focused conversations that turn opportunities into real business success for pre-arranged, high-impact meetings in a fully equipped, distraction-free and confidential environment.

– Gold & West Africa Forum

Nigeria’s gold sector is gaining traction as one of the most promising segments of its mining industry. With increasing private sector interest, artisanal mining reforms, and government initiatives such as the Presidential Artisanal Gold Mining Development Initiative (PAGMI), the country is positioning itself as a key gold producer in West Africa.

– Power-To-Mines Forum

This one-day forum on the sidelines of Nigeria Mining Week will bring together key stakeholders from Nigeria’s power and mining sectors. The forum is a direct response to the critical interdependence of these two industries, recognising that a stable and reliable electricity supply is a precondition for Nigeria’s mining-led industrial transformation and its goal of achieving a US$1 trillion economy by 2030.

– Quarrying Forum

The Quarrying Forum is a dedicated platform that will bring together key stakeholders to explore advancements in technology, sustainable practices, and investment strategies that are vital for powering the nation’s infrastructure and construction industries. It is an essential platform where owners, operators, suppliers, and policymakers come together to innovate and overcome industry challenges, ultimately building a more sustainable and robust quarrying landscape.

– Steel Forum

The Steel Forum is a strategic platform dedicated to strengthening Nigeria’s steel sector as a driver of industrialisation, job creation and infrastructure development. Despite having abundant iron ore and other critical inputs, Nigeria continues to import large volumes of steel products. This forum will unpack the opportunities to accelerate domestic steel production, enhance beneficiation, and unlock partnerships that can reduce dependence on imports and make Nigeria a regional steel hub.

– Women in Extractive Industries Forum

The Women in Extractive Industries Forum celebrates the contributions of women across mining and extractives while creating space for dialogue on gender equity, inclusion, and leadership. This forum creates a roadmap for increasing women’s visibility, participation, and access to finance in Nigeria’s mining value chain.

– Gemstones Forum

Gemstones Forum at Nigeria Mining Week is designed to spotlight Nigeria’s potential as a regional and global hub for gemstone mining, processing, and trading. It will explore avenues for formalisation, certification, value addition, and export diversification, ultimately positioning Nigeria as a competitive player in the global gemstone market.

Industry support

From 13 to 15 October, Nigeria Mining Week once again will showcase dozens of exciting mining and extractive projects in the country. The event is also expected to gather attendees from more than 20 countries, including more than 2,300 mining professionals, around 90 sponsors and exhibitors, some 180 mining operators and in excess of 137 expert speakers and VIPs.

Over the last decade, Nigeria Mining Week has become thé gathering place for many leading mining bosses and suppliers,many of whom have become longstanding partners and sponsors for the Abuja gathering. Titan Minerals Ltd is returning as the diamond plus sponsor; KMDC, Mikano Motors, Sinogrand and Xugong Nigeria Company Ltd are diamond sponsors; and SMT Nigeria is back as a platinum sponsor.

FirstBank CEO pays trio purpose visit to Governor Radda,"Katsina State Governor, Dikko Umaru Radda, on Thursday evening received Segun Alebiosu, Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of First Bank of Nigeria, on a courtesy visit to the Government House, Katsina.

Mr Alebiosu’s visit had three purposes: to condole with Governor Radda over the passing of former President Muhammadu Buhari, to welcome him back from his recent medical trip following a minor road accident, and to felicitate with him on the occasion of his 56th birthday.

During the visit, Mr Alebiosu offered special prayers for the late President Buhari, asking Almighty Allah to forgive his shortcomings.

He also prayed for Governor Radda continued protection, while commending the Governor’s bold reforms and people-centered initiatives that are driving economic growth and development across Katsina State. He further wished the Governor a happy birthday.

Governor Radda warmly welcomed Mr. Alebiosu and his delegation, expressing deep gratitude for their solidarity and kind gestures. He described the visit as thoughtful and reassuring, adding that such goodwill further strengthens the bonds of partnership between government and the private sector.

The First Bank CEO was accompanied by Shehu Aliyu, Executive Director (Public Sector); Ibrahim Ali Bala Kuki, Chairman, Board of Directors, Norrenberger Financial Services Group Aliyu Mashi Regional Manager North First Bank and Usman Lawal, Area Controller, North, International Energy Insurance Plc.

Also present at the meeting were the Katsina State Accountant General, Nura Tela, and the Special Adviser to the Governor on Chieftaincy Affairs, Usman Abba Jaye.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/promoted/820542-firstbank-ceo-pays-trio-purpose-visit-to-governor-radda.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"Governor Radda announces selection of 2,166 students for Katsina model schools","Katsina State Governor, Malam Dikko Umaru Radda, has revealed that six children from each of the state’s 361 wards have been selected through examinations to attend new special model schools with free education. The governor made this known on Thursday during the launch of the Dan Amana Tested and Trusted Initiative at Nagogo Primary School, Katsina.

Speaking at the event where orphans and vulnerable children received school supplies, Governor Radda said the selection was based purely on merit without favoritism. “Our vision is to give these children quality education so that, in the next two or three decades, they will grow to contribute meaningfully to Katsina State,” the governor stated.

He emphasized that his administration operates on merit, noting that the state had sponsored children from poor backgrounds to study medicine in Egypt and Artificial Intelligence in China based on academic performance. The Governor described the gathering as significant, saying “This is not just any gathering—it is for the noble purpose of helping those most in need, the orphans and the less privileged.”

Governor Radda said supporting the underprivileged invites Allah’s mercy, adding that his government would always attend such community-building initiatives. He praised teachers for their efforts and urged them to work with government to sustain Katsina’s educational legacy.

Earlier, Director General of Dan Amana Tested and Trusted, Suleiman Kabir Barda, said the group was established to support less privileged children’s access to education. “Today’s launch is only the beginning; we will continue visiting schools regularly,” Mr Barda announced while distributing uniforms, books, and school bags to beneficiaries. He explained that the initiative targets children who have lost parents or whose families cannot afford schooling.

Mr Barda also stressed that progress requires community unity to uplift one another, drawing inspiration from the state’s leadership. The Deputy Chairman of Katsina Local Government, Usman Yusuf Saulawa, representing Chairman Isah Miqdad Ad Saude, described the initiative as noble and timely. He further expressed gratitude to Sulaiman Kabir Barda and his group for the support given to the vulnerable citizens.

The event attracted Commissioner for Higher, Technical and Vocational Education Dr Muhammadu Isa, KYCV Coordinator Mr Kabir Abdullahi, education officials, headmasters, and community leaders.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/promoted/820510-governor-radda-announces-selection-of-2166-students-for-katsina-model-schools.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Turning Points: How five moments reshaped Africa’s World Cup race,"The latest round of World Cup qualifiers in Africa showed again how quickly things can change.

One country booked an early ticket, a new signing gave fresh energy to his national team, injuries slowed down a contender, a young winger announced himself on the big stage, and a striker in red-hot club form gave his team a lifeline.

Below is a breakdown of five moments that shaped the World Cup chase, closing with updated standings after both qualifying games.

Morocco 5–0 Niger — first African nation through

Morocco’s emphatic win in Rabat did more than extend a strong run; it confirmed the Atlas Lions as the continent’s first qualifier for 2026.

Their follow-up 2–0 win away in Zambia added polish to an already commanding campaign, bringing their tally to 21 points from seven games.

That outcome takes them out of the equation for group rivals, turning Group E from a three-way contest into a battle for second place. It also allows coach Walid Regragui to rotate and test his squad with two matches to spare.

For the rest of Africa, the message is clear: steady results and efficient finishing decide groups. Morocco’s early qualification reduces the number of contenders, raising pressure on other group leaders to secure top spot while second-place races become the last hope for survival.

Yoane Wissa’s lift for DR Congo

DR Congo’s 4–1 win over South Sudan featured Yoane Wissa making an immediate impression after his transfer. A striker arriving in form at club level can alter international plans overnight: coaches gain a new outlet, opponents must rethink, and the group balance shifts.

Wissa’s link with Cedric Bakambu gave DR Congo fresh attacking variety and a clearer path toward top spot. Though his efforts could not prevent a 3–2 comeback win by Senegal in the following match, the earlier victory kept them just two points behind the group leaders on 18 points, leaving the door open should Senegal slip.

Such players often turn tight margins into decisive wins, proving how a single addition can alter the direction of a qualifying campaign.

South Africa 3–0 Lesotho — progress checked by injuries

South Africa’s 3–0 win extended their lead, but two defensive injuries complicated preparations ahead of a crucial tie with Nigeria. In qualifying, depth is often as important as form; one injury can shift momentum.

Despite those setbacks, Bafana Bafana earned a 1–1 draw against Nigeria in Bloemfontein, keeping them six points ahead of their West African rivals with a healthy goal difference and three points clear of Benin Republic.

Still, routine wins sometimes carry hidden costs. If injuries linger, they could hand opportunities to pursuers like Benin.

Yankuba Minteh announces himself — Gambia’s away statement in Nairobi

Gambia’s 3–1 victory in Kenya, driven by Yankuba Minteh’s pace and directness, showed the difference a single match-winner can make. It hinted at what might have been for the Scorpions had results like this come earlier in the campaign.

With two matches left, Gambia sit 10 points adrift of leaders Ivory Coast and behind Gabon on 19 points. The window for qualification is effectively closed, but Minteh’s performance highlighted how even late sparks can force opponents to adjust.

For smaller nations, the model remains straightforward: combine a standout player with solid structure, and you become capable of unsettling bigger names.

Serhou Guirassy keeps Guinea in contention

Serhou Guirassy’s goals in Guinea’s 3–0 win over Somalia reinforced the value of club form translating to international football. For Guinea, his presence offers a focal point, but also paints a target for opponents.

Despite his contribution, Guinea remain eight points behind Algeria and four off Uganda in the playoff spot. Their chances of direct qualification are slim, but the striker gives them a reason to push for the playoff route.

Meanwhile, Cape Verde’s six wins and one draw have put them four points clear in Group D, just three points away from what could be a historic first World Cup qualification.

Five lessons from the window

Playoff qualification is often the price of dropped points — Morocco’s near-flawless run proves margins matter.

One transfer or one form player can change the balance; Wissa and Guirassy are examples.

Injuries reshape campaigns quickly — South Africa’s defensive issues underline this.

Small teams can tilt groups with a single threat — Minteh showed how.

Depth and fitness management remain the surest path to qualification.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/features-and-interviews/820564-turning-points-how-five-moments-reshaped-africas-world-cup-race.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"‘We Just Want Dignity’: Over 3,000 lepers, families endure neglect in Nigeria’s leprosy colonies","Leprosy destroyed Mohammed Umaru’s dreams.

“I wanted to be a teacher. Maybe even a professor. But everything changed,” Mr Umaru, who lives in a leprosy colony in Ebute Metta, Lagos State, said. “I completed secondary school in 1994. But this illness started around 1987, before I graduated.”

Across Nigeria, thousands of leprosy survivors and their children are trapped in the misery of poverty, neglect, stigmatisation and discrimination. Over 3,000 lepers in the country face daily battles with chronic illnesses, psychological trauma, and poverty.

With little or no access to healthcare, the women give birth at home, without medical supervision. Education is a distant dream – many children in leprosy colonies are out of school. To survive, parents beg for alms while their children hawk along dangerous roads, reflecting how society has turned its back on them.

Nigeria officially records at least 2,500 new leprosy cases annually. Over 400,000 people live with the long-term consequences of the disease in 61 settlements nationwide.

Leprosy, also known as Hansen’s disease, is a chronic infectious condition caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. It primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, upper respiratory tract, and eyes.

The disease spreads through prolonged close contact with an untreated person, often via respiratory droplets like coughs or sneezes.

However, contrary to common belief, leprosy is not highly contagious and is curable, especially when treated early. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends a multi-drug therapy (MDT) regimen, which is supposed to be provided for free across many countries, including Nigeria.

Although early diagnosis and treatment can prevent lifelong disability, stigma, isolation, and poor access to healthcare leave many patients untreated, trapped in a cycle of preventable suffering.

When PREMIUM TIMES visited four colonies – Alheri in Abuja, Elega in Ogun State, and Ebute-Metta and Alaba Rago in Lagos, the daily fight for survival, dignity, and recognition was evident.

In the colonies, survival is both a physical and psychological battle. Sadly, Abuja, the country’s capital, and Lagos State, the commercial capital, arguably host the most poverty-stricken victims in their three leprosy colonies.

The colonies are built around dumpsites, and the inhabitants survive on hard-to-get, polluted and foul-smelling water, contributing to widespread cases of pneumonia, skin rashes and muscle diseases among residents. UNICEF reported in 2019 that Nigeria accounted for the highest number of global child pneumonia deaths.

Alaba Rago, Ebutte Metta

Over 2,000 lepers live in Alaba Rago, a densely populated slum and dumpsite in the Ojo Local Government Area of Lagos State. The settlement is not connected to electric power and gets its water from a single source – a borehole donated in 2008. Families practice open defecation while pregnant women deliver babies at home, using unhealthy measures of delivery, because there is no public hospital in the area.

“We invite private doctors for serious cases, and we seek money through street begging to foot the bill,” said Umar Abdulrahim, an indigene of Kano State, at the Lagos colony.

Mr Abdulrahim, a father of eight, was a teacher in Kano for 10 years until he was retrenched in 1981 because of his illness.

In the Ebutte Metta settlement, where over 200 live in dilapidated structures, lepers face similar tribulation. Many are blind, many can’t walk, and only a few work.

Lepers, aged between 45 and 75 years, struggle to provide for their children, forcing them into street begging.

After graduating from secondary school, Mr Umaru enrolled in a college of education. But leprosy and society’s rejection ended that path. By 2000, he had arrived in Lagos, forced to beg to survive. He lives in the Ebute Metta settlement with his wife and seven children.

Inside the settlement, the struggles run deeper. Toilets are few and often damaged. During the rainy season, the soakaways overflow, spreading filth and disease. Elderly residents, some in their 70s, are forced to crawl or depend on others to relieve themselves. Children bathe in open spaces—some wander off and never return, lost to the streets of Lagos.

“There’s no system here,” Ahmad Abubakar, the community leader, explained. “If someone can help you to the toilet, fine. If not, you crawl. This is our reality.”

After living for decades in Lagos, many of the inhabitants feel abandoned. “The government helped us back in the day. During the military era, food came monthly. Now, we wait six or seven months, and nothing happens. We’re forgotten,” Mr Abubakar said.

Built in 1997 for lepers displaced from Kano, the compound once symbolised relief. But now, it is crumbly from neglect. The walls are cracked, the roofs leak, and government support has dried up.

“If they can fix our buildings and support our children’s schooling, that would change everything,” a woman said in Hausa, clutching her infant. “We just want to live with dignity.”

Why Colonies Exist, Persist

Historically, leprosy colonies were established to isolate infected individuals and prevent the spread of the disease. Colonial governments and early public health authorities often forced lepers into remote, self-contained settlements to separate them from society.

However, modern medicine no longer justifies this segregation. Experts and international health agencies, including WHO and The Leprosy Mission, argue that isolation-based approaches violate human rights and reinforce damaging stigma. Instead, they advocate for community-based care, reintegration, and access to quality healthcare and education.

Despite this, many Nigerian colonies have remained in existence, some for over 60 years, due to weak policies, lingering stigma, lack of rehabilitation plans, and failed reintegration.

Education, a universal cry in settlements

In the Ogun State and Abuja settlements, lepers want education for their children. Their struggle to support their children’s education is seen in many out-of-school children in the colonies.

Although Elega and Ebutte Metta colonies have accessible public primary schools, the children often do not proceed to secondary school for financial reasons.

“We are struggling to survive, so we can’t fund their education to those levels,” Folorunsho Lukman, the secretary of the Elega leprosy colony, said.

Mr Abubakar said his children attend a public school, where his first child was preparing for the final junior secondary school exams after the Salah holiday. But he still needs assistance. “I want the government to support their education. I couldn’t finish my own schooling, but I want all my children to go as far as university,” he said.

The children in Alaba Rago walk 80 minutes to the town and still get discriminated against in school because of the condition of their parents.

“They attend Ajegunle Government Primary School. However, not all our children attend because we face a lot of stigmatisation. Some children are mocked by other children. This affects them emotionally. They stop attending school out of shame, even though they were born healthy. We try to comfort and encourage them, reminding them that education is their future, even after we’re gone,” another resident said bitterly.

At the Alheri public school, only one of the five buildings is in a good state.

Poverty in the colonies

Ogun lepers appear to be better off. Operating a “no leper must beg” policy, they work hard to feed themselves and those who cannot work stay home.

“None of our members can go out begging, because we want our dignity to be there,” Jimoh Hammed, the chairman of the Elega Leprosy Settlement, said.

Despite the policy, only five of the 28 survivors have work.

Besides Mr Hammed and Mr Lukman, who drive taxis for a living, the other three who work sell herbs.

Among those who work is Folasade Olanrewaju, a mother of three battling a persistent leg ache. Her only child, who is old enough to help her, is in school. “I give her ₦1,500 daily for school, and she eats when she returns,” Mrs Olanrewaju said, her eyes dimmed by years of struggle. “I depend on selling herbs. I trek to the farm where I get them and struggle so my daughters won’t beg or become wayward.”

“A trip takes me two hours. Sometimes, I rest more than twice on the road. I’ve been doing this for 20 years, even with my bad leg. I go to the market twice a week.”

Mrs Olanrewaju spends over ₦90,000 per term on her child in school. “I’m using only one leg. If I can find something I can do without stressing my leg, I’d take it,” she said.

Nearby, Idowu Abudu, known in the area as Iya Eleko, has lived at Elega for over two decades. “Before I came here, I was making eko (corn pap),” she recalled. “But when I started making pap here, smoke from the fire affected my eyes and blurred my vision.”

“But I can’t stop. I have five children to cater for.” She supplements her earnings by selling herbs.

Through their pain, these women, and the few others still able to work, support others who can’t, ensuring no one goes out to beg.

The children also hawk to support their parents, selling wara (local cheese), doughnuts and other snacks. However, in other settlements like Ebute Metta and Alaba Rago, children and parents engage in street begging.

To support the lepers in its Elega colony, the Ogun State Government gives each adult leper ₦30,000 monthly, raising the stipend from ₦10,000 in March 2024. However, many of them said the allowance is inadequate because they have families to take care of.

Healthcare in colonies

Cases of skin rashes, ulcers, pneumonia, High Blood Pressure (HBP), muscle disease, cough, diabetes, among many other diseases are high in the four colonies visited by this reporter.

Yet, Alaba Rago and Ebutte Metta colonies in Lagos do not have public health care facilities. The residents go to the nearest primary health centre for treatment or embark on self-medication.

“We lack many things and feel forgotten. Our challenges are many, and we need help with food, clothing, education, and health care. Our people are suffering,” said Mr Abubakar.

“We don’t have access to healthcare,” Mr Umaru said. If someone falls sick, we go to the local chemist and buy medicine with the little we beg for by the roadside. If the illness is serious, we sometimes report to the local government, and we might get assistance for a day or two.”

However, in the Elega colony in Ogun, 20 of the 28 of them were diagnosed with high blood pressure. Ironically, a general hospital sits in the middle of the settlement. Yet, survivors are left without drugs or access to free health care.

Many lepers also suffer from diabetes, while their children constantly fight malaria and typhoid, according to a health officer at the general hospital who pleaded anonymity for fear of victimisation.

“They have to pay for other services, or we prescribe drugs for them to buy outside,” said the officer, adding that “the only thing we do for free is listen to their complaints.”

The situation is no better at the Alheri colony in Abuja. The only health centre in the area is rapidly deteriorating. Skin rashes, pneumonia, and muscle disease are rising, yet the centre lacks basic medical supplies.

Isah Aruna, a middle-aged resident of Alheri, shows his scars with trembling fingers. “See my body; it itches badly, and when I scratch it, blood comes out,” he said, his voice lined with pain.

The burden of care is left to overstretched volunteers and underpaid workers, like Salisu Aruna, a doctor. “Any doctor that comes here must be devoted to them and try to get them drugs from any organisation that comes here,” he explained. “Some NGOs have brought medicines, but they’ve finished. We keep reminding them anytime they come again.”

One of those unpaid workers is Isa Muhammad, a 50-year-old who hasn’t been paid in three years. “For years, we’ve not gotten help from the government,” he said.

Hussein Shinkoso, 52, a carpenter and clinic staff member, shares a similar story. “I live here with my family. The Leprosy Mission Nigeria used to give us stipends, but that has stopped. It’s been three years since I last received anything from the government. If they can give us grinding machines, we can at least make a living.”

Others like Mallam Adamu, an elderly ulcer patient, express needs beyond medicine. “It’s been a long time since we got shoes. We need support in that regard, too,” he said.

NGOs Come to Aid

Where state institutions have failed, NGOs have stepped in, albeit with limited and intermittent resources.

At the Elega colony, Mr Lukman expressed cautious gratitude. “We thank the local organisations that support us, like the Lions Club, Rotary Club, Mace Club, and many NGOs,” he said. “They visit us often, giving us food, water, and financial assistance. Some even helped us power our water systems with solar energy.”

Also in Abuja, the Leprosy Mission Nigeria, FCT branch, provides constant support for lepers, as testified by the residents of the Alheri colony.

The mission’s programme officer, David Aire, described their ongoing support efforts, saying, “This community is one of our project locations.”

“We’ve been able to treat and cure some individuals and have provided footwear, protective wear, and crutches to those who lost limbs or fingers,” he said.

Things could get worse

Health professionals decry the conditions in Nigeria’s leprosy colonies, warning of dire health consequences if systemic neglect continues. With many residents suffering from chronic illnesses such as hypertension, ulcers, pneumonia, and diabetes, the collapse of regular access to medication and medical personnel poses an immediate threat. In Elega, for example, 20 of 28 lepers live with high blood pressure, yet have to pay out-of-pocket for treatment despite a state hospital within walking distance.

A March 2025 investigation by Reuters revealed that Nigeria’s multi-drug therapy (MDT) stockpile, the global standard for treating leprosy, ran dry for almost a year, leaving thousands untreated.

Medical staff at ERCC Hospital in Nasarawa lamented the resulting complications, including amputations and irreversible nerve damage. “If fingers are lost, where will you get them back?” one health worker asked, highlighting the cost of delayed care.

Doctors working within the settlements report mounting pressure and dwindling morale. At Alheri, the sole clinic is crumbling and without water, with unpaid staff struggling to respond to a rise in malaria and pneumonia among both adults and children.

Muhammed Abdullah, a full-time doctor, describes a system teetering on collapse. “The majority of the cases are malaria and pneumonia,” he said. “Some come for hypertension or ulcers. The cases that are beyond us, we refer them to Kwali General Hospital.”

But the clinic is struggling. “We have challenges with drugs. We need the government to provide support. It’s only NGOs that assist. There is no water, and the facility needs repairs. And we haven’t received any government support in three years,” Mr Abdullah lamented.

Even the casual workers have been left without pay. “Some of them now neglect their duty. That’s why, at times, you see the clinic is dirty,” he added. “These people feed their families from what they earn here. Now, they’re forced to beg to survive.”

The WHO’s Global Leprosy Strategy, 2021–2030, calls for ending leprosy as a public health problem by focusing on early detection, zero discrimination, and zero disability. It promotes integrating patients into normal society and discourages the use of colonies unless strictly temporary.

According to a 2022 UN Human Rights report, forced isolation of persons affected by leprosy “violates international human rights obligations” and urges countries to “dismantle colonies where possible and invest in inclusive social protection programmes.”

International experts have also echoed these concerns. The UN Special Rapporteur on leprosy has repeatedly warned that poor healthcare infrastructure in such communities threatens not only human dignity but also public health security. Without swift intervention, doctors and health experts fear that curable conditions will continue to cause permanent disabilities and deaths in these neglected corners of Nigeria.

Government keeps mum

The Ogun State and Lagos State governments refused to react to the state of the colonies in their states.

When contacted, the Lagos State Commissioner of Health, Akin Abayomi, requested a one-on-one interview, which was not realisable for this reporter due to the long distance. After explaining the situation and urgency of this report, Mr Abayomi continuously ignored other messages sent to him by the reporter.

This reporter also reached out to the Director of Public Affairs at the Lagos State Ministry of Health, Olatunbosun Ogunbanwo, who, for up to a month, did not give an audience after listening to the synopsis of the story. Calls and text messages were sent, but not responded to.

Also, the Ogun State Commissioner of Health, Tomi Coker, did not respond to the messages sent to her via WhatsApp or SMS.

At the federal health ministry, this reporter submitted a letter requesting an interview to discuss the situation at the Alheri colony.

For over a month, this reporter followed up with visits and phone calls to the ministry; the only response this reporter got was a call from an official at the ministry, saying, “We’re working on it, we’d get back to you very soon.” The official refused to mention his name.

This reporter also reached out to the Special Assistant to the Mandate Secretary, Health and Environmental Service Secretariat, on Media, Bola Ajao, who provided the contact of Dan Gadzama, the director of Public Health, FCT, and said he was the appropriate person to speak to.

When contacted, Mr Gadzama told the reporter he has no order to reveal any information yet. He simply said, “Work is going on and we will get back to you soon.”

He later sent a text message, “Thank you for that memo on the Lepers community. God bless you and your family for speaking out for the poor and vulnerable.”

The silence across all levels of government, Lagos, Ogun, Abuja, and beyond, paints a grim picture. For thousands living in the leprosy colonies, the hope for dignity, healthcare, and humane treatment remains a dream.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/health/health-features/820516-we-just-want-dignity-over-3000-lepers-families-endure-neglect-in-nigerias-leprosy-colonies.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"Nigeria’s Health Financing Dialogue: Promises, gaps and the road ahead","Nigeria’s healthcare system is underfunded and overstretched, with millions of citizens paying directly for services at the point of use.

More than 70 per cent of total health expenditure comes directly from households, one of the highest rates in the world, leaving families vulnerable to high costs and deepening poverty.

Against this backdrop, from 1 to 4 September 2025, the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare convened a National Health Financing Policy Dialogue in Abuja under the theme “Reimagining the Future of Health Financing in Nigeria.”

The theme reflects Nigeria’s aspiration for enhanced domestic and sustainable financing in pursuing Universal Health Coverage (UHC).

For four days, policymakers, civil society leaders, academics, the private sector, development partners, and the media debated moving from repeated policy declarations to strategic implementation.

PREMIUM TIMES followed the deliberations, capturing the key ideas, concerns and proposals that emerged.

Insurance expansion, Out-of-pocket challenges

The most pressing concern for many was Nigeria’s heavy reliance on direct household payments.

Health financing scholar John Ataguba described the dependence on out-of-pocket spending as “really problematic.”

Mr Ataguba explained that Nigerians spend about $70 per person directly on healthcare, compared to only $14 per capita spent by the government.

For him, genuine financial protection can only be achieved when out-of-pocket expenditure drops below 20 per cent.

In response to the concerns, the federal government announced one of the dialogue’s headline commitments, which is to enrol 44 million Nigerians into health insurance by 2030, up from fewer than 20 million today.

This pledge, according to the Minister of State for Health and Social Welfare, Iziaq Salako, is part of a broader effort to reduce health spending and strengthen financial protection for households.

The pledge generated optimism, but many cautioned that it could remain aspirational unless budget releases are consistent and financial management improves.

Also, coverage under the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) still falls below 10 per cent, raising doubts about whether the new promises will translate into real access for Nigerians.

Primary Health Care

If health financing reforms are to deliver tangible results, many participants stressed that Primary Health Care (PHC) must be the entry point. Despite repeated pledges, PHC facilities across Nigeria remain under-resourced, poorly staffed, and in many cases, barely functional.

They highlighted structural issues that weaken PHC delivery: health worker migration, fragmented state-level programmes, and poor integration of local government budgets. Even where resources exist, delays in fund release and weak accountability mechanisms mean services often fail to reach citizens.

In response, Mr Salako announced that the ministry was considering approaching the National Assembly to increase the Basic Health Care Provision Fund (BHCPF) from the current one per cent to two per cent of consolidated revenue. Officials argued the increase would help revitalise thousands of PHC centres nationwide.

Experts, however, highlighted that revitalising PHC requires more than additional funding, noting that efficiency, transparency, and stronger community engagement must be at the core.

Reducing donor dependence

Sustainability was another recurring theme during the dialogue. Nigeria continues to rely heavily on donor financing for key programmes in immunisation, HIV, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Experts cautioned that these vertical funding streams often bypass or even weaken domestic systems.

At the event, the Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Muhammad Pate, stressed that the country cannot depend indefinitely on aid to solve its health problems, noting that domestic resource mobilisation is the only sustainable path.

The call resonated across sessions, with participants urging federal, state and local governments to prioritise health in their budgets and ensure that approved funds are disbursed.

Increase Health Budget

Mohamed Janabi, WHO regional director for Africa, urged Nigeria to move beyond communiqués and increase health spending to at least 20 per cent of the national budget, while reducing out-of-pocket payments.

Mr Janabi said this will ensure Nigeria moves towards achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC).

He also highlighted the need for evidence-based policymaking and accountability in implementation, stressing that sustainable domestic financing does not mean shutting out donor support.

Mr Salako, the Minister of State for Health and Social Welfare, said that to achieve its goal of health financing, Nigeria is prepared to learn from best practices in other countries.

“Ghana and Kenya, for example, demonstrate that successful healthcare financing requires political commitment, innovative funding mechanisms, strong legal frameworks, community engagement, decentralised implementation, and expanded coverage,” he said.

He said Nigeria aims to adapt such models, strengthen regional collaborations, and apply context-specific innovations.

Bridging research, policy gap

To achieve Universal Health Coverage, experts agreed that Nigeria must strengthen its health financing systems and build stronger links between research and policymaking.

Chigozie Uneke, a professor of Health Systems and vice-chancellor of the David Umahi Federal University of Health Sciences (DUFUHS), argued that most Nigerian health research is underutilised because it is not aligned with policymakers’ priorities.

Mr Uneke blamed a “publish or perish” academic culture that rewards volume over relevance.

He proposed that government-funded research grants be linked to ministry priorities, ensuring that researchers focus on studies with practical policy impact.

Kamil Shoretire, director of Health Planning, Research and Statistics at the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, echoed the concern, saying researchers must go beyond academic output and engage directly with decision-makers.

On her part, Susana De, the Gates Foundation’s deputy director for Health and Nutrition in Ethiopia, stressed that success should not be judged by prestigious journal publications but by whether findings influence change.

Prudent use of fiscal gains

At the high-level dialogue, finance leaders warned that rising government revenues must not be allowed to dissipate without impact.

Akin Oyebode, Ekiti State’s Commissioner for Finance, cautioned that sudden fiscal gains risk becoming “numbers on paper” if not matched by executed expenditure.

He flagged weaknesses in fragmented nutrition programmes and noted that health-worker migration, driven by pay disparities across states, is hollowing out primary care.

The Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Muyi Aina, echoed a similar concern, saying costs for vaccines and other essential commodities are rising faster than budget adjustments.

He stressed that efficiency, transparency, and accountability must accompany additional resources. “Donors and partners can support,” he said, “but Nigeria must first demonstrate its own commitment.”

State, local govt’s roles

At the event, the Chairman of the House of Representatives’ Committee on Health Care Services, Amos Magaji, called for stronger legislative backing, deeper state involvement, and innovative financing models to strengthen Nigeria’s health system and expand access to quality healthcare.

Mr Magaji stressed that healthcare financing should not be left to the federal government alone, noting that states and local governments are closest to the people and play a pivotal role in mobilising resources.

Aminu Hassan, chairman of Jalingo Local Government in Taraba State, argued that councils must commit more resources at their level, insisting that 25 per cent of local government budgets should be dedicated to healthcare.

Similarly, Samuel Gejere, a former Karu council chairman who represented the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON), pressed for an increase in councils’ share of the federation account, from 20.6 per cent to 35 per cent.

He criticised the culture of empowerment projects such as motorcycle distributions and urged that funds be channelled instead toward sustainable health investments.

Diaspora, private sector roles

At the event, Mr Pate highlighted the potential role of the diaspora and the private sector in achieving a reliable health system in Nigeria.

He encouraged Nigerians abroad to move beyond ad hoc remittances and pay directly into insurance schemes for relatives at home.

“Instead of sending money when an aunt or uncle is sick, you can pay for their insurance. That brings the diaspora closer home,” he said.

Mr Pate also cited new initiatives, including dialysis subsidies, fistula repair programmes, and a planned catastrophic health fund, as signs of reform momentum, stressing that private sector engagement will be central to sustaining progress.

The road ahead

The country is making bold promises on insurance expansion and funding, yet it remains heavily dependent on donors. Revenues are rising, but budget execution and accountability remain weak.

Sub-national governments hold key responsibilities, but their commitment is uneven. Also, plenty of research exists, but they are often disconnected from the policy cycle.

Meanwhile, these challenges are not new to Nigeria’s health system. Nigeria has signed ambitious declarations before, including the Abuja target of 15 per cent budgetary allocation to health and the rollout of national and state-level insurance schemes.

However, implementation has consistently lagged with the country’s health budget still a little above five per cent of the total annual budget.

Now, with donor contributions declining, particularly as global priorities shift and traditional funders such as the United States scale back support, the pressure on Nigeria to mobilise domestic resources has never been greater.

The health financing dialogue has set a fresh round of promises, but the test will be whether these translate into measurable improvements in health outcomes for all Nigerians.

Until then, the health system will remain overstretched and ordinary citizens will keep paying the price.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/819892-nigerias-health-financing-dialogue-promises-gaps-and-the-road-ahead.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
EXPLAINER: The 5% Surcharge on Fuel: What is true and what is not,"This note seeks to clarify matters arising regarding the 5% surcharge on fuel in the new tax laws. The charge is not a new tax introduced by the current administration. The provision already exists under the Federal Roads Maintenance Agency (Amendment) Act, 2007. Its restatement in the new Tax Act is for harmonisation and transparency rather than immediate implementation.

We outline the frequently asked questions below and provide clarifying explanations.

Frequently Asked Questions

Q1. Is it true that Tinubu’s administration introduced a 5% surcharge on fuel?

A1. No. The surcharge is not new. It already exists under the Federal Roads Maintenance Agency (Amendment) Act, 2007 (FERMA Act). The new Tax Act only restates it for harmonisation and transparency. Hence, it was not part of the original tax reform bills submitted by the president to the National Assembly.

Q2. Does this mean the 5% surcharge on fuel will commence in January 2026 when the new tax laws take effect?

A2. No. The surcharge does not take effect automatically with the new tax laws. It will only commence when the Minister of Finance issues an order published in the Official Gazette as stated under Chapter 7 of the Nigeria Tax Act, 2025. This safeguard ensures careful consideration of timing and economic conditions before implementation.

Q3. Will the surcharge apply to all fuel products?

A3. No. Several energy products used by households are exempt. This includes household kerosene, cooking gas (LPG), and compressed natural gas (CNG). Clean and renewable energy products are also excluded to align with Nigeria’s energy transition agenda.

Q4. Why not abolish the charge, given the current hardship and the risk of higher inflation?

A4. The 5% surcharge on fuel is designed as a dedicated fund for road infrastructure and maintenance. If implemented effectively, it will provide safer travel conditions, reduce travel time and cost, lower logistics costs and vehicle maintenance expenses, which will benefit the wider economy. This practice is virtually universal with over 150 countries imposing various charges ranging between 20% to 80% of fuel products to guarantee regular investment in road infrastructure.

Q5. Why can’t savings from fuel subsidy removal be used instead?

A5. While subsidy savings will provide some funding, they are insufficient to meet Nigeria’s huge and recurring road infrastructure needs among other public finance needs. A dedicated fund ensures reliable and predictable financing for roads, complementing the budget and ensuring roads are not left underfunded.

Q6. Isn’t this at odds with the reform objective of reducing taxes and easing the burden on citizens?

A6. Not at all. The reforms have already reduced multiple taxes and removed or suspended several charges that directly affect households and small businesses, such as VAT on fuel, excise tax on telecoms, and the cybersecurity levy. By harmonising earmarked taxes, government is reducing duplication and ensuring a more efficient tax system.

Q7. Why not just amend the FERMA Act to remove the 5% surcharge on fuel?

A7. Yes, the surcharge has been removed from the FERMA Act and incorporated into the new tax laws which are designed to provide a forward-looking legal framework for Nigeria. Keeping this provision in place within a harmonised legal framework ensures Nigeria is prepared to address critical challenges, such as sustainable road financing and even climate change impacts. It is not about immediate implementation, but to ensure the law provides a clear and effective framework for when it becomes necessary in the future.

NCCU reflects Taiwan’s history – Wan-Ying Yang,"Wan-Ying Yang is the Dean of the College of Social Sciences at National Chengchi University (NCCU), Taipei City, Taiwan. In this interview with Bunmi Fatoye-Matory, the academic discusses her experience at the university, gender equality in Taiwan and other issues.

Excerpts:

Premium Times: Tell us about your university.

Dean Yang: National Chengchi University, NCCU, is a unique place. It reflects the history of Taiwan. It was founded in mainland China in 1927. In two years, it will be our 100th anniversary. It was founded by Kuomintang, KMT, which was then a revolutionary party with Leninist orientation. They fled to Taiwan after losing the civil war to the Chinese Communist Party led by Chairman Mao. The university was founded to train young party cadres who would lead the party, but it later expanded its mission. Back then, if you obtained a degree from NCCU, you would get a job like mayor or magistrate. NCCU is modelled like Science Po, a university in Paris founded in 1872 to train French elites to manage the bureaucracy. In the beginning, NCCU focused on political science and public finance. After KMT lost the civil war, the university was brought to Taiwan and reorganised. KMT imposed martial law on Taiwan for 38 years. They became authoritarian. The university was associated with the party leadership. In the 1980s, there was a movement for democratisation. A university is a mirror of the political history of a country. We started rethinking NCCU. After a decade of struggle, democratisation came in the early 90’s. In 1996, we had the first direct presidential elections. The legislative Yuan was not democratically elected until 1992. For a long time, most of the legislators were those elected in mainland China. Even though they lost the war, they retained their positions and insisted they were the only party for China. I was born under authoritarian rule, and I was a student at NCCU during the struggle for democratisation. I joined the Wild Lily Movement. Students protested at the Chiang Kai Shek Memorial. He was the authoritarian leader of KMT, and students didn’t want him to be memorialised. They called his Memorial Hall a secular temple. It’s a big debate for many countries- how to remember the past. Under martial law imposed by Chiang Shek, there was press censorship, many freedoms were taken, and many lives were lost. But there was also economic development.

My parents’ generation lived through the 1950s and 60s. Taiwan was a poor country. Then it became prosperous, like the four Asian Tigers. It was called the ‘Taiwan Miracle’- a big transformation to a modern, booming economy, but no free elections. People are divided about remembering the past. How do you do Transitional Justice? NCCU is heavily involved in this history. Our university is a public university. In Taiwan, the best universities are public, not the private ones. They are regulated by the Ministry of Education and funded by the government. NCCU looks no different from other public universities. The main goal of NCCU is to become independent of party affiliations and ideology. Our strength is our high social and public impact, but we also have a historical legacy which could be a liability. Now, we have transformed successfully. We are one of the top universities in Taiwan. We rank very high in the Social Sciences and Humanities. We don’t have Law, Medicine, and Applied Sciences. We have a small Natural Science programme. National Taiwan University is the best, and we rank second. My niece, who is in the final year of high school, was selecting what college to attend, and her teacher told her to choose National Taiwan University or National Chengchi University. The past gave us historical memory and great assets. We can recruit the best faculty and the best students. The Wild Lily Flower Movement built a big Wild Lily statue and placed it at the Chiang Kai Chek Memorial Hall. They chose the symbol of Wild Lily because the flower grows wild on our land, thriving in the mountains of Taiwan. It represents resilience in the face of harsh and difficult mountain conditions. Students viewed their struggle this way, and they were not fighting for themselves. They were fighting for public good. They met with government leaders at the Presidential Hall to submit petitions for elections and democracy.

Premium Times: Tell us about yourself. Are you proud to be back here?

Dean Wang: I started my education at NCCU in 1989 and graduated in 1993. I didn’t know what to study at first. I just wanted to continue studying. I applied to American universities. There were no computers back then, so I bought a typewriter and applied to five universities. I was accepted at Michigan State University at Lansing, where I earned my Ph.D. in six years. I studied gender politics. I was born on Kinmen Island, a place that remained a battlefield between China and Taiwan for some time because of its geography. Kinmen is very close to China, but KMT, while retreating after losing the war to China, took it and secured it as a military base. There were battles in 1949 and 1958 as both sides struggled over its control. I grew up hearing the sounds of bombs. Its geographic proximity to China was illustrated by a story told in Kinmen where I was growing up, that a young man who completed his military training literally swung from the island to mainland China and joined the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and became a top economist and party leader in China. There were no private airplanes on the island because of the military base. When I was little, it took eight to nine hours to go by boat to Taiwan, which was an overnight trip. It took just one hour from Kinmen to mainland China by boat. After I came back from the US, I taught in a private university. You could immediately tell who the good students were. This is not determined by GPA scores but by their willingness to pay attention and learn. For me, what really mattered was teaching and research. My field is gender politics. It was a marginal field then in political science. Only in sociology was it recognised. This has since changed. Why I was interested in gender politics has its roots in my upbringing. Kinmen, being a small island, had a tight social network, which is good. My family has a total of six kids in the order of two girls, one boy, two girls, one boy. People of my parents’ generation had big families, but he has only one sister. In the 1970s, the government launched a programme to limit family size, sending out propaganda that the ideal family size should have two or three children, that a nuclear family of two children is better for higher education and better quality of life. In my father’s generation, he was the only son. In Confucius’ thinking, having one son is dangerous because sons carry the family name. So my parents were obligated to have more than one son. I’m the second of six children. My deep gender consciousness came from how the girls in our family were treated in relation to the boys. Boys were spoiled and matured much later. This happens in patriarchal families. They treat the sons very well, and marry them good wives, who will take care of the sons’ parents. Parents worry a lot about sons who are given more resources and attention. They don’t need to earn whatever they are given, whereas girls have to earn it. I wanted to learn piano and my father said I had to be at the top three of my class. I was already one of the top students in my class. My brother was at the bottom of his class. When he ranked 10th, my father gave him a bike as a reward. In the university, I took classes in political science and sociology. In graduate school, I studied gender politics, which is not a pure academic field. It combines activism and academics. I was active in women’s organisations like the Awakening Women’s organisation, founded by women scholars and lawyers, who pushed for reforms legally. I served as president of the organisation and was a member for 10 years. We lacked financial resources. One needs to raise funds. As a scholar, I couldn’t. But I learned a lot about managing organisations. I benefited a lot from participating in the Women’s organisations. I figured if I could successfully run an NGO, I could run anything. I was invited to be the Chair of a department at the university in 2014. It was my first administrative job at the university. After this, I was offered the position of Associate Dean, which was when I started learning about academic administration and service. I had to learn how best to find a mission and serve the community. I was offered my first two administrative jobs, just like many women in politics were (offered) their positions. Becoming Dean was, however, very competitive. I had to sacrifice my research and teaching. I used to teach two courses, now I teach one. My course is a big class, which is burdensome. I teach it to relieve my colleagues of the burden. I sacrifice my own interest in teaching gender classes.

Women have double shifts. They work hard at their careers outside and then go home to perform domestic labour. In academic leadership, it is triple shifts. Fortunately or unfortunately, I don’t have children. My husband works in another city and we only see during the weekends. As a younger scholar, I was very busy doing teaching, research, and public service. Taiwan’s low birth rate is related to this. Mine is an individual case, but it’s symptomatic of the general trend among women. Women have to struggle to balance work-family life. We fought for women’s autonomy, independence, and gender equality, which led to an unintended ‘Womb Strike’. It is a consequence of the progress of our struggle in terms of gender equality.

Premium Times: What does gender equality look like in Taiwan?

Dean Wang: By global ranking, the gender equality index ranks Taiwan at the top 10 in the world using politics, education and different social dimensions as metrics. We have a high percentage of women politicians. Over 40 per cent of parliamentarians in Taiwan are women. We are the first Asian country to legalise same-sex marriage. My friends in Japan and Korea studying gender and political participation, said they envy Taiwan. There is gender equality in almost all domains. We already had gender parity in education in the ‘90s. It prepared women for social and political participation, even before democratisation. Women’s employment and labour force participation is a tricky issue, though. There was a 30 per cent gap between men and women in the past; now it is about 10 per cent. There is also wage disparity. As for political participation, we have a higher women’s participation in political leadership because we pushed for reforms. There were already quotas for women in the draft constitution, which was brought from China by the KMT after losing the war. There was a national assembly in China in 1945 before the civil war. Before democratisation in Taiwan, you cannot change the constitution or have any reforms. It was frozen. The constitution was ratified at the first election in Taiwan. Some of the legislators were elected in mainland China and came to Taiwan with KMT. They became permanent legislators, claiming they were the legitimate government of China. There was no party competition. In 1969, a few supplementary seats for Taiwan district were created. There were no free elections as a whole. In 1970, we started having opposition activists pushing for reforms, even though we were still under martial law. They cannot form a party. Their activism of several decades led to an election in 1992. When I was a college student, the legislators were quite old. Some were in wheelchairs, in their ‘90s. They were elected in the 1940s in China and were still there in the 1990s.

Democratisation made female participation possible. Women joined the movement for democratisation, and when the political opportunity came, they pushed for higher quotas for women in the assembly. Women formed coalitions. I stated in one of my articles that there is no neutral institution. Institutions favour some groups and disadvantage others. Women have to participate in the process, to look carefully at electoral rules, gender quota, and also participate in party organisation. The current ruling party, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), has the one-quarter rule, that one of the four seats in each district must be occupied by a woman. Many of the legal reforms were spearheaded by Ms Peng, a DPP party cadre in the women’s branch. She was the leader of a women’s organisation and had the idea to push for higher gender quota. She had international connections and attended women’s conferences in the United States. In the mid-’90s, she was a DPP delegate, but tragically, she was murdered, and the case remains unsolved. It was not a political murder. She wasn’t famous at that point. She was working with women’s organisations and championed the one-quarter proposal for women’s quota. Her death was a tragedy. In 1995 and 1996, there was a big march for women’s security. Women experienced a lot of insecurity in public spaces – sexual harassment, murder and so on. Women couldn’t take taxis and feel safe. There was a rumour Ms Peng was murdered by a taxi driver. Everything has changed now, for the better. There is CCTV everywhere. Her proposal was adopted in 1996 by DPP, and KMT lost the election, so they too adopted the proposal. In the 1990s, women’s seats were less than 20 per cent, then they increased to 25 per cent after the one-quarter rule passed. After year 2000, they increased to 30 per cent, now they are 40 per cent. The change was fast. My colleagues and I agree that institutional reforms are necessary to create effective change. In 2005, we had another constitutional amendment, which is the last one up till now. Women were a part of the constitutional amendment. We pushed for proportional representation. Women scholars and lawyers are at the forefront of the struggle. We don’t want to be the chess on the board. We want to change the rules of the game. As I said earlier, no institutional rule is neutral. Free and fair elections do not guarantee fairness, justice or social representation. One’s choices are always constrained by the rule.

Recycle or Cut Production: The Politics of Plastics Economy,"The global conference to create a legally binding treaty to end plastic pollution ended in a gridlock, with many participants decrying the decision of producing parties to shift attention towards improving plastic waste management instead of addressing plastic from source to consumption, a disregard for the sheer impacts of plastic on humans, animals, and the environment at large.

Since its discovery, synthetic plastic has played a central role in the Industrial Revolution and modern civilisation, being the most used attachment in the manufacturing of all types of finished goods, including electronics, furniture, automobiles, sports utilities and fashion. Although its initial introduction to the manufacturing industry in 1907 came as a breakthrough as a cheaper alternative that drastically reduced the cost of production and enhanced the manufacturing process, its single-use business model by far contributes to the social and environmental impact it has today, having replaced many essential alternatives such as bottles, ceramic and metal foils. Today’s plastics are ominously used by all, and their micro form can be found virtually in everything in the air, water, in plants and even the bloodstreams of animals.

Studies indicate that more than 1,500 species in marine and terrestrial environments are known to ingest plastics. Over one million marine animals die each year from plastic pollution. Also, a 2023 Tearfund study estimates that 218 million of the world’s poorest people are at risk from more severe and frequent flooding caused by plastic waste. Of this population, 41 million are infants, elderly people or people with disabilities who are at particularly high risk of severe health conditions. Plastic debris blocking drainage and waterways has also contributed to municipal flooding, causing the destruction of limited infrastructure, the displacement of people, the death of humans, and livestock.

The Guardian also reported that the life cycle of plastic from production to consumption dumped into landfills induces a myriad of health challenges, including cancer, lung disease and birth defects.

The imperative to address plastics as a modern inhibitor of sustainable consumption and environmental conservation may therefore be justified given the overwhelming evidence of its existential threats to not only humans but to the entire planet. This urgency, therefore, calls for a binding agreement to curb further implications of plastics and, as such, justifies the UN convening a series of negotiations to deliver the world’s first plastic treaty under the aegis of the International Negotiating Committee (INC).

The INC is the product of the 5th session of the UN Environment Assembly, which adopted a historic resolution to develop and adopt an international legally binding instrument (ILBI). First held in November 2022 in Punta del Este, Uruguay, the session hosted parties from over 100 countries to address the common problem. Since then, the negotiations have been an endless marathon with parties already meeting 6 times between November 2022 and August 2025, with the latest INC5.2—anticipated to be the decisive treaty to find a conclusive agreement— ending in another gridlock.

Graham Forbes, head of the Greenpeace delegation in Geneva, described the situation as a disappointing outcome.

“We are going in circles. We cannot continue to do the same thing and expect a different result,” he said.

While the most popular consensus outside the negotiating rooms supports the narratives to find lifetime solution to plastics, dominant voices from the plastic manufacturing industry and parties representing oil-producing states such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, favour an integrated circular economy and waste management literacy as a saving grace for retaining plastic production until global oil production is completely phased out, thus framing recycling as a viable solution to stopping plastics in its entirety.

Ross Eisenberg, president of America’s Plastic Makers, while speaking to the BBC, supported this idea, describing plastics as fundamental for modern life. “They go in everything. Focusing on ending plastic pollution should be the priority here, not ending plastic production,” he said.

The oil and gas and largely the manufacturing industry has contributed immensely to the industrial revolution of the past 70 years, pre-dating the digital revolution and even providing energy and hardware respectively, for the new digital era. However, plastics were a notable element of that era with a production scale of over 460 million metric tonnes annually, of which an estimated 20 million ended up polluting our environment. This figure is expected to reach 1.7 billion metric tons by 2060.

It is no surprise that despite the obviously visible and measurable impact of plastics on the environment and by extension daily human lives, a convention of such magnitude poised to find a middle ground has stalled.

The rationale to explain it further assess plastics along with its closest allies, oil and gas. Although packaged differently, plastic (in its various forms) are derivative products of the catalytic distillation of crude oil. Being a less needed product in the value chain from historical context has made it cheaply available for commercial production and in turn, public consumption. Its impact and use, however, has made it become a ubiquitous and indispensable product of modern society. Arguably the most demanded commodity across all agriculture, fashion, automobiles, education and other industries, plastic subtly ranks as one of the most profitable businesses of the century, retaining its status quo as the cheapest commodity easily accessible and affordable by all regardless of socioeconomic status.

This backdrop is a simple highlight of the business interest against a plastic treaty that will cut production and add layers of support to the growing demand for transition away from crude oil and its derivatives. As long as the oil & gas moguls remain in business, plastic production may not be easily swept aside. This view is supported by the African Energy Chamber, which described the plastic treaty as a threat to the socioeconomic development of oil producing nations, especially in Africa.

Also, Reuters reported how the US notified several delegations ahead of the plastic talks of its decision to derail the treaty to limit plastic production, urging them to follow suit.

Meanwhile, contrary to these prevailing narratives, Nigeria and some other oil producing nations representing the high ambition coalition supported the need to harmonise the agreement to ensure that regulation of plastic is even and addresses the full life cycle of plastics with due consideration of global environmental impacts.

Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, recently granted a license to Dangote refinery, arguably the world’s largest single-train petroleum refinery, to commence the production of polypropylene. This is despite the existence of regional and national policies against unbiodegradable wastes such as the Lagos State ban of single-use plastics in 2024 including plastic straws, plastic cutlery, and all single-use carrier bags and nylons that have less than 40 micron thickness. The Nigerian government also announced a ban on single-use plastics in government offices and at events hosted by the federal government and its agencies.

Such conflicting policies, swerving between prioritising economic and social interests and addressing the impact of plastics, are among many reasons why leaving plastic solutions to voluntary national measures may falter.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/819633-recycle-or-cut-production-the-politics-of-plastics-economy.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"FIRS, EFCC strengthen alliance to enforce tax compliance","The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has deepened collaboration with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to strengthen Nigeria’s tax compliance framework and safeguard public revenue.

The development marks another step in the government’s push to curb leakages and foster voluntary tax compliance among citizens and businesses.

The renewed commitment of the agencies was disclosed in a courtesy visit by the Executive Chairman of FIRS, Zacch Adedeji to the EFCC headquarters in Abuja on 9 September.

At the meeting, Mr Adedeji underscored the need for inter-agency cooperation to maintain financial stability and build public trust in the nation’s tax system.

“We cannot pursue 200 million Nigerians individually to do the right thing, but we want to put a system in place that will aid compliance.

“You can help us by letting people know that when they violate the law, there is a place you can keep them. On behalf of the President and Nigerians, we thank you for your support and seek even deeper cooperation,” he said.

The FIRS boss emphasized that the most effective driver of voluntary compliance was visible evidence of how tax revenues were being used.

According to him, when taxpayers see government investments in infrastructure, healthcare, and education funded by taxes, they are more inclined to comply willingly.

“The main advertisement of voluntary compliance is when people begin to see what we use the money we collect for. In achieving that goal, you are critical, not just in arresting defaulters but in supporting our Department of Fraud Risk, Assessment and Control to ensure value for money.”

Mr Adedeji further highlighted the role of preventive strategies and partnerships in achieving Nigeria’s revenue goals. He noted that the agency’s recent success in meeting its revenue target was not a unilateral achievement but the product of collective efforts with enforcement partners like the EFCC.

EFCC

In his response, EFCC Chairman, Ola Olukoyede, reaffirmed the commission’s readiness to work closely with FIRS in enforcing compliance. He argued that such collaboration would send a strong deterrent message to potential defaulters.

“Collaboration is very key. When they see EFCC beside FIRS, that will send a signal to the public that it is no longer business as usual,” he said.

Mr Olukoyede also drew attention to a recent Court of Appeal judgment affirming the EFCC’s authority to investigate tax-related fraud.

Describing the ruling as a major boost, Mr Olukoyede explained that while the EFCC was not responsible for assessing tax liabilities, it had the statutory power to investigate cases of non-compliance and hand over assessment issues to FIRS.

“Our duty remains prevention, investigation and prosecution of financial crimes. Synergy is therefore essential.”

Partnership

The renewed partnership between FIRS and EFCC comes at a time when Nigeria grapples with declining oil revenues and rising fiscal pressures, which makes efficient tax administration a cornerstone of the government’s economic strategy.

Experts argue that strengthening compliance not only broadens the tax base but also reduces reliance on borrowing to fund the national budget.

Both leaders pledged to consolidate their working relationship, with a shared focus on preventive measures, enforcement, and voluntary compliance as the backbone of Nigeria’s tax system.

For taxpayers, the message is that compliance is not optional, and failure to meet obligations could now come with stiffer consequences.

The collaboration signals a stronger institutional front against tax evasion and financial crimes, aligning with broader government reforms aimed at ensuring accountability and improving public finance management.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/business-news/820429-firs-efcc-strengthen-alliance-to-enforce-tax-compliance.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"Banking, fintech consumers dominate 9,000 complaints in 6 months – FCCPC","The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) on Thursday released new data showing it received more than 9,000 consumer complaints between March and August, resolving cases that led to recoveries of over N10 billion.

The commission disclosed this in a statement signed by its Director of Corporate Affairs, Ondaje Ijagwu.

Banking topped the list with 3,173 complaints, followed by fast-moving consumer goods (1,543), fintech (1,442) and electricity (458).

Other sectors included e-commerce (412), telecommunications (409), retail and shopping (329), aviation (243), information technology (131) and road transport and logistics (114).

The commission said the grievances ranged from unfair charges, unauthorised deductions and deceptive marketing to product defects and failure to provide redress within acceptable timelines.

“These numbers are not just statistics; they tell the story of consumer frustration, and the daily challenges Nigerians face in essential services,” FCCPC Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive Officer Tunji Bello said.

“However, the FCCPC is determined to hold businesses accountable, ensure compliance with the FCCPA, and promote fair market practices that protect the welfare of all consumers.”

Banking remained the dominant source of grievances, both in volume and financial exposure, with recurring disputes over loan deductions, account charges and failed transactions.

The commission said the prevalence of financial sector disputes highlighted the reliance of the public on its intervention in systemic challenges.

Banking and fintech together accounted for the highest financial impact, revealing consumer vulnerability in essential, high-value services. The FCCPC said the trend pointed to the need for stronger joint oversight with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).

Electricity ranked fourth with 458 complaints, mostly billing disputes and service failures. The commission said the findings underlined the importance of closer coordination between the FCCPC, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), state regulators and distribution companies.

E-commerce disputes were described as relatively low in monetary value but high in frequency. The commission noted recurring complaints over delayed deliveries, refunds and counterfeit goods, reflecting growing exposure of consumers to online transactions.

The report also flagged a high incidence of disputes linked to digital lending, investment schemes and microfinance services.

The FCCPC said this coincided with the unveiling of a new regulation to curb abuses in the digital lending sector.

It said it was intensifying monitoring, enforcement and collaboration with other regulators, particularly in financial and utility services, where recurring patterns of consumer exploitation required corrective action. It encouraged companies to study the data and improve internal complaint handling.

The commission reminded consumers to continue reporting violations through the FCCPC complaint portal, its zonal and state offices, noting that each report helps identify systemic issues and enforce compliance.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/business-news/820426-banking-fintech-consumers-dominate-9000-complaints-in-6-months-fccpc.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"NCAA warns airlines about unruly passengers, outlines reforms","The Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has issued a fresh directive to airlines, warning pilots not to commence flights until unruly passengers are either removed from the aircraft or their disputes resolved.

The directive was given by the Director-General of the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (DGCA), Chris Najomo.

The NCAA’s Director of Public Affairs and Consumer Protection, Michael Achimugu, who made the announcement on behalf of the NCAA DGCA on Wednesday during a meeting with domestic airline operaton, said the directives seeks to set discipline and improve safety in the aviation sector.

“Pilots must not fly until unruly passengers are removed from the aircraft by security or the issue resolved amicably. This will go a long way to protect cabin crew and ensure passengers treat them with courtesy,” Mr Achimugu told PREMIUM TIMES

He stressed that incidents of harassment and abuse of airline staff had become too frequent, often because pilots failed to assert authority. “Going forward, no passenger has the right to touch any cabin crew,” he warned.

Caution.

While underscoring the new directive, the NCAA also reminded cabin crew of their duty to remain professional in their interactions with passengers.

“Cabin crew should not be rude, and passengers should not misconstrue firmness as rudeness,” Mr Achimugu added.

Ifueko Abdulmalik, Senior Special Assistant to the Director-General of NCAA, also used the forum to warn airlines against poor treatment of travellers.

She said operators would be sanctioned for failing to notify and provide care to passengers during delays or cancellations, a recurring grievance in Nigeria’s aviation industry.

The NCAA said that insisting that no plane should take off with an unruly passenger onboard is to ensure that safety, civility, and accountability will no longer be compromised in the country’s aviation space.

Wider reforms

The Abuja meeting, attended by airlines including Air Peace, Arik, Ibom Air, Aero Contractors, United Nigeria, Max Air, Rano Air, ValueJet, Green Africa and Overland, covered a broad range of issues affecting travellers and operators.

Among them were, passenger handling protocols and unresolved refund/compensation complaints, enforcement of phone switch-off instructions, protection for cabin crew and plans to introduce RFID bag tags and flight monitoring technology to improve efficiency.

The NCAA also disclosed it would soon embark on a nationwide passenger awareness campaign to educate Nigerians on their rights and responsibilities when travelling.

Unruly passenger behaviour, ranging from verbal abuse to physical assault on airline staff, has been a growing challenge globally, with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently noting a rise in such incidents post-COVID-19.

In Nigeria, the issue has been compounded by flight delays, cancellations, and poor communication by operators, which often leave passengers frustrated.

In an interview with PREMIUM TIMES, Martin Abhulimen, Ibom Air Regional Manager Lagos and West Africa, said the airline have been following due diligence in handling unruly passengers.

He added that the NCAA warns airlines about unruly passengers, outlines reforms e directives came timely as they are working towards improving their customers service to ensure smooth operations.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/820290-ncaa-warns-airlines-about-unruly-passengers-outlines-reforms.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
NUPRC secures over $400 million for decommissioning liabilities – Official,"The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) said it has taken significant steps to safeguard the country’s oil and gas sector by securing over $400 million in pre-sale decommissioning and abandonment liabilities through letters of credit and escrow accounts.

The NUPRC’s Head of Media and Strategic Communications, Eniola Akinkuotu, in a statement, said its Chief Executive, Gbenga Komolafe, disclosed this while speaking at the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) Companies Forum, held in Lagos on Wednesday.

“Over $400 million in pre-sale decommissioning and abandonment liabilities have been secured through Letters of Credit and escrow accounts. Host Community Development Trust obligations are fully honoured. Environmental remediation commitments worth over $9.2 million have been pledged while awaiting the formal gazetting of the ERF Regulations,” Mr Komolafe said.

Mr Komolafe said the commission had drawn lessons of divestments from lessons of the North Sea, where decommissioning is estimated at £27 billion by 2032, the Gulf of Mexico costing over $9 billion and in Canada’s Alberta, more than 97,000 inactive or abandoned wells now carry an estimated decommissioning and abandonment cost of between C$30 and C$70 billion.

In Australia, he said Northern Oil & Gas Australia in 2019 left behind liabilities of more than AU$200 million.

He added that the lessons from these experiences guided the recent divestment approvals from NAOC to Oando Energy Resources; Equinor to Chappal Energies; Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited to Seplat Energies; SPDC to Renaissance Africa Energy; and TotalEnergies to Telema Energies.

“Without a robust and enforceable framework for abandonment and decommissioning, divestment transitions can create lasting financial and environmental burdens. Nigeria is not immune to this challenge, and if we are to avert costly mistakes.

“It is precisely to avoid this outcome that Nigeria, through the Petroleum Industry Act and subsequent regulatory actions, has taken bold and decisive steps,” Mr Komolafe said.

Mr Komolafe, represented by the Deputy Director, Human Resources, Corporate Services & Administration, Efemona Bassey, highlighted Nigeria’s response to the recent divestments in line with Sections 232 and 233 of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) which place full responsibility for the decommissioning and abandonment of petroleum wells, installations, structures, utilities, plants, and pipelines on licensees and lessees.

He said chapter 3 of the PIA and Section 104 of the PIA, establish specific obligations for host community development and environmental remediation respectively.

Mr Komolafe said each of the 2024 divestments provided a critical opportunity to put the commission’s divestment framework to test and action.

“By rigorously assessing the technical capacity of acquiring entities, verifying their financial strength, and securing decommissioning and abandonment obligations through upfront escrow arrangements.”

He said the results from 2024 speak for themselves.

Beyond the significant progress achieved through the divestment framework, he said, it is important to highlight another milestone.

“Since April 2023, we have approved 94 Decommissioning and Abandonment (D&A) plans, in strict alignment with the PIA. These approvals represent total liabilities of $4.424 billion, arising from all field development plans submitted within this period, and will be remitted progressively over the production life of the respective fields into designated escrow accounts,” he added.

He noted that the commission has addressed a long-standing concern with the IOCs regarding the domiciliation of the escrow accounts; and the regulatory framework, developed after extensive consultations with industry stakeholders, is now awaiting gazetting by the Ministry of Justice.

“In addition to divestments, the commission has been working together with operators, particularly members of Oil Producers Trade Section (OPTS), on life extension projects, ranging from facility integrity audits to subsea upgrades and enhanced reservoir management measures that sustain safe production, delay decommissioning, reduce environmental risks, and secure resilience across our mature fields,” he said.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/business-news/820235-nuprc-secures-over-400-million-for-decommissioning-liabilities-official.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Group seeks financial inclusion for women in Nigeria,"A group, the Women’s World Banking (WWB), has convened a workshop to advance Women’s Digital Financial Inclusion (WDFI).

WWB is an international non-profit organisation focused on advocating for women’s economic empowerment across the globe.

The workshop, held last week in Abuja, was conducted in partnership with the Presidential Committee on Economic and Financial Inclusion (PreCEFI), WWB said in a statement on 21 August.

The PreCEFI is a Nigerian inter-agency task force established in February 2025 to accelerate economic reforms and bridge financial gaps.

The statement said the workshop was intended to directly support Nigeria’s “aspiration to build a trillion-dollar economy by unlocking women’s full economic potential through increased access to and usage of financial services.”

“The interactive workshop explored collaborative partnerships in advancing WDFI in Nigeria, bringing together stakeholders from the public and private sectors,” the statement said.

It listed some of the private and public sectors to include the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System, National Insurance Commission, Nigerian Communications Commission, Bank of Industry, Deposit Money Banks, Microfinance Institutions, FinTechs, and Development Finance Institutions.

“The event was in furtherance of Nigeria’s national economic and financial inclusion goals of achieving 95 per cent financial inclusion and closing the nine per cent gender gap in access to financial services,” the statement added.

Participants at the workshop, according to the statement, recognised that women’s economic empowerment was central to inclusive growth, poverty reduction, and achieving macroeconomic stability.

Participants’ reactions

Speaking at the workshop, Nurudeen Zauro, the technical advisor on Economic and Financial Inclusion to Nigeria’s President, Bola Tinubu, stressed that the synergy between PreCEFI and WWB was undeniable.

Mr Zauro said both PreCEFI and WWB prioritise listening to women, designing services around their realities, and scaling impact.

He also noted that the workshop was about aligning national and global strategies to accelerate progress towards Nigeria’s trillion-dollar economy aspiration.

Also speaking, Uche Uzoebo, the chief executive officer of Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities Limited (SANEF), praised WWB on the partnership and for convening the event.

SANEF is an initiative of the CBN created in 2019 to deepen financial inclusion in Nigeria.

At the workshop, Ms Uzoebo noted that SANEF’s collaboration with WWB was imperative because it would accelerate the penetration of agent banking, particularly in northern Nigeria.

This, she said, will facilitate an increase in the number of women with access to financial services.

In her remarks, Elizabeth Gathai, the WWB’s regional head in Africa, emphasised Nigeria’s potential to lead Africa in women’s economic empowerment.

Ms Gathai argued that Nigeria’s lead in the initiative would boost access to productive credit, halving financial exclusion in the North, and driving gender-intentional policies that close the gap.

She reaffirmed WWB’s commitment to building a “more resilient and inclusive financial system for women.”

At the event, the WWB and SANEF signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to expand the agent banking footprint and productivity for women in northern Nigeria.

The MoU, according to the statement, signifies a “concrete step” toward delivering the Nigerian government’s inclusive finance commitments and ensuring that women are not left behind in the digital economy.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/financial-inclusion/817379-group-seeks-financial-inclusion-for-women-in-nigeria.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Group advocates smart lending to empower women entrepreneurs in Nigeria,"A global non-profit group, Women’s World Banking (WWB), is advocating smart lending practices to intensify efforts to narrow the gender gap in Nigeria’s financial inclusion.

The group said this “transformative approach” streamlines credit processes by combining technology and education, making them more efficient and accessible for women entrepreneurs.

WWB focuses on advancing women’s economic empowerment globally.

The group hosted a workshop in Lagos on 5 February on the theme “Advocacy Convening: Smart Lending—Business Skills and Digital Capabilities for Smarter Borrowing and Better Outcomes.”

According to a statement sent to PREMIUM TIMES on Tuesday, the workshop brought together financial institutions and industry experts to strategise on equipping women with business and digital skills.

The statement, quoting a PwC report, said that despite Nigerian women managing over 23 million microbusinesses, only 10 per cent have access to formal financial loans.

The statement said this limited access stifles their potential in a sector where they represent 41 per cent of microbusiness owners.

“The goal is not just to provide productive funding but to equip women with the skills and tools needed for long-term financial success,” said Angela Wambugu, WWB’s director of advisory Services for Africa.

“By combining business education with digital innovation, WWB, alongside our partners, aims to unlock the financial potential of millions of women entrepreneurs across Nigeria.”

Technology is at the heart of this transformation. Ngozi Ndefo, WWB’s associate of advisory services for Africa, highlighted its power: “Women play a vital role in Africa’s economy, especially in Nigeria, where many are microbusiness owners. However, barriers such as low digital skills and limited access to financial services hinder their ability to scale.”

She added, “Digital solutions, such as mobile banking and financial literacy apps, can significantly reduce these barriers. Smart lending, with its focus on proper bookkeeping, financial literacy, and digital tools, not only reduces default rates but also strengthens relationships between financial institutions and borrowers.”

Challenges

Financial literacy remains a major challenge in Nigeria, where, according to the Central Bank of Nigeria, only 38 per cent of adults are financially literate, and 40 per cent lack access to banking services.

Barriers such as limited access to smartphones exacerbate the issue for women. While 88 per cent of Nigerian women own mobile phones, only 23 per cent use smartphones.

“Tailored or personalised digital solutions present a clear opportunity to turn this into an advantage,” Ms Ndefo said. “Financial institutions must design tools that cater to women’s specific needs, ensuring both accessibility and security.”

Jennifer Iwueze, WWB’s regional research lead for Africa, stressed the critical role of data-driven solutions.

“Thorough research ensures that loan products and training programmes align with customer capacities,” she said.

“Segmentation, for instance, helps institutions design solutions that are age- and literacy-appropriate, reducing the risk of non-performing loans.”

She added, “It is not enough to introduce digital services. Organisations must first understand whether their customers are ready for such tools.”

WWB is collaborating with FCMB Microfinance Bank on smart lending.

“Since adopting smart lending principles, FCMB has introduced initiatives such as health insurance, digital credit, and financial literacy programs tailored to women’s needs,” said Friday Nwokolo, acting managing director of FCMB Microfinance Bank.

He shared a success story of a female borrower who accessed a N50,000 loan and later benefited from N300,000 in health insurance during a hospital stay.

“This support enabled her to recover and resume her business without financial strain,” he noted.

According to the statement, the FCMB has reduced loan disbursement times from two days to five hours, with plans to streamline further to two-hour disbursements.

Paul Adu, the managing director of NUT Oke-Bola Microfinance Bank, echoed the importance of collaboration, sharing his institution’s commitment to raising the proportion of female borrowers from 73 to 80 per cent through more inclusive offerings.

“The training provided practical tools for creating customer-centred products that address women’s unique financial needs,” he said.

Hundred million target in 2027

WWB was founded in 1979.

According to the statement, the group has transformed over 83 million lives in emerging markets through access to financial products and services.

In Nigeria, the group said it is collaborating with the Central Bank of Nigeria and other stakeholders to develop frameworks prioritising women’s financial inclusion, particularly in underserved communities.

The group said their target is to empower 100 million women by 2027 through driving inclusive growth that benefits households, businesses, and communities worldwide.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/financial-inclusion/774384-group-advocates-smart-lending-to-empower-women-entrepreneurs-in-nigeria.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
SPECIAL REPORT: How poor regulation of instant payment system fuels criminality in Nigeria,"“When they announced that we had been kidnapped, at first, I was just laughing. I was busy looking for a hidden camera because I thought it was a prank. You know, the usual pranks on social media,” Kemi Gbadamosi* recounted her ordeal at the hands of a criminal gang operating the “one chance” scheme and exploiting the weaknesses in Nigeria’s instant payment system.

Within one hour, she was beaten, sexually assaulted, and threatened with rape before her family paid a ransom of N2 million via a POS machine.

Ms Gbadamosi had left her house in the Gbagada area of Lagos State at around 5:30 a.m. on 10 October 2023. That morning, her major concern was to avoid the usual heavy traffic along the route to Lagos Island, where the bank she worked with is located. The events that followed left a scar and changed her forever. Her routine was simple: wake up before 5 a.m. and get to the bus stop before 6 a.m. Any deviation from that timetable could mean spending hours in traffic.

On that fateful day, she arrived at the bus stop on time, standing beside another lady.

She did her usual check when a Toyota Sienna vehicle pulled up beside her. The passengers inside were well-dressed and appeared to be in their mid-40s. Reassured, she and the other lady hopped in. She became more relaxed when the driver paid the agbero (park tout) at the bus stop. However, less than five minutes into the trip, one of the passengers announced to her, “This is a kidnap.”

“They were well-dressed and in their 40s. Immediately the car was on the move, they started attacking us. They announced that they were kidnappers.

“They asked me how much I had in my account. I told them, and they later asked me to start opening my bank accounts,” she said during a phone interview.

Drawing from her experience as a bank worker, she attempted to lock herself out of her mobile app by intentionally entering the wrong password. She knew that after three failed attempts, she would be locked out. Unfortunately for her, the kidnappers were familiar with the tactic. On the second attempt, the gang leader warned her, “If you try it again, we will rape you.”

“Because I was scared of being raped, I had no choice but to open all my mobile apps,” she stated, pausing periodically as she narrated.

That was not the only time they would threaten rape. They found the threat an effective strategy alongside beating.

When the money in her bank account was insufficient, she was asked to call her family to send more money. In the end, the kidnappers collected N2 million from her and another N2 million from the second victim.

Ms Gbadamosi is just one of the hundreds of people who have been victims of kidnapping for ransom or one chance, where the abductors used mobile money transfers with the authorities unable to trace them.

For this report exploring how criminals are exploiting the vulnerabilities in the country’s instant payment system, PREMIUM TIMES interviewed several other victims whose stories are similar.

All these happen despite the mandatory linking of all bank accounts in Nigeria to the Bank Verification Number (BVN), a unique 11-digit identifier that links a person’s financial accounts to their biometric data.

According to a recent report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), N2.2 trillion was reportedly paid as ransom to kidnappers within 12 months.

The Crime Experience and Security Perception Survey (CESPS) estimated that the average ransom collected was N2.7 million. This worrisome report paints a grim picture that threatens Nigeria’s fast-developing instant payment system.

According to Premier Oiwoh, CEO and Managing Director of NIBSS, 10 billion mobile transactions were carried out in Nigeria in 2023.

Speaking at the launch of the 2024 SIPS (State of Inclusive Instant Payment Systems) report in Accra, Ghana, Mr Oiwoh stated that the country is expected to have about 12 billion transactions in 2024.

Over the past couple of years, the instant payment system has grown exponentially in Nigeria. Experts traced this growth to the inclusion of fintech companies in the payment system. The redesign of the naira in 2022 and the attendant cash scarcity accelerated the adoption of mobile money. Even traders in markets now have POS machines.

However, enforcing regulatory compliance has been a major challenge in the sector, particularly on the part of Payment Service Providers who own the POS devices.

According to the 2024 report, this lack of regulatory compliance hinders the NIP system from achieving full maturity.

“As for how inclusivity is likely to evolve at the system level, NIP in Nigeria currently has the highest likelihood of reaching mature inclusivity in the future. It has integrated all use cases, including G2P and cross-border payments, the latter through integration with PAPSS.

“The only mature criteria it has not yet fulfilled involve providing additional recourse channels for end users who need to dispute a transaction. In fairness, recourse is a development area for all the other systems and is complex to implement, as it requires additional resources and monitoring,” the 2024 SIPS report reads.

Experts say enforcing compliance rules would help address the challenges. Stanley Jacob, an expert in the fintech sector, told PREMIUM TIMES that criminals can be tracked easily if banks or operators are made liable for providing information about their customers.

“It is not impossible to track the criminals. It is easier than a lot of us imagine. Banking is like a club. When you have a club, immediately you admit a bad player; the club is exposed to bad behaviour. As far as I am concerned, I think the Central Bank needs to do a lot more to protect the consumers.

“That also follows for any settlement, be it electronic or paper. The question is, if I transfer money to a bad player in a bank, then the bank should also be held liable if they are unable to produce the customer.

“The moment you admit them into the settlement system, they should also be subjected to the same stringent rules as other banks. They must be able to produce and present their customers. POS is just a device; the money is still being domiciled in a particular bank account,” he said during a phone interview.

Another expert, Babatunde Obrimah, said some criminals use gaming and cryptocurrency platforms to make it difficult to track their transactions.

To address the challenge, Mr Obrimah said there is a need for interoperability efforts involving telecom regulators and anti-graft agencies.

“The problem is that some money goes through gaming and cryptocurrency platforms. If money is moving from bank to bank, it is easy to track. This is why regulation is important. There has to be interoperability among the regulators. Some even use the money to buy airtime.

“There must be collaboration among telecom operators, NCC, the EFCC, NFIO, the Central Bank and the banks. There is a lot of conversation going on. However, collaboration among regulators is not easy,” he said.

Recent efforts by the CBN to curb criminal activities within instant payment system

Recently, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has tried to curb the activities of these criminals by issuing strict circulars to regulate the activities of POS operators in the country.

Last September, the CBN issued a new directive requiring all Payment Service Providers (PSPs) to integrate their transactions through a Payment Terminal Service Aggregator (PTSA) to streamline and track electronic transactions in the country.

PSPs are required to submit monthly returns to the CBN, detailing the number of merchants and agents they manage, their POS terminal deployment, and the volume of corresponding transactions.

The report is expected to reach the CBN no later than seven days after the end of each month.

The circular also warned that noncompliance within 30 days of issuance would result in appropriate sanctions.

A source at the central bank, who did not want his name mentioned because he is not permitted to speak to the media, said some of the bank’s actions are expected to yield results by 2025. He added that POS operators had in the past operated with impunity, but most now comply or risk sanctions.

Last month, the House of Representatives also took measures to address the problem following a motion moved by Idem Uyime.

In the motion, the lawmakers resolved that the CBN should shut down platforms used by the one-chance operators.

Pending when the results are seen, victims like Ms Gbadamosi have resorted to lifestyle changes or even discontinued using mobile banking as precautionary measures.

“One thing I learnt from the ordeal is that my account that has money inside, I don’t have a mobile app for it and I don’t even leave the SMS alert on my phone. I made some adjustments. It wised me up a bit. Even if I decided to have a mobile app, it would not be visible,” she said.

*Kemi Gbadamosi is a pseudo-name created for the victim after she asked that her real name not be used.

Nigeria’s economy stabilises. But Nigerians are still hungry,"Biola Abayomi pleaded with the butcher for the umpteenth time, her demeanour pitiful. 46-year-old Mrs Abayomi, a fashion stylist and mother of two children, appears desperate to purchase a cut of beef at N2,000, but the butcher disagrees, their voice drowned out by the chatter of traders and passersby at the Sango-Ota market in Ogun State. It’s the second week of August, and Mrs Abayomi told PREMIUM TIMES she hadn’t bought beef since the first quarter of the year, due to its sky-high prices. The middle-aged woman would later wobble away from the butcher’s stall, amid lamentation.

“We have been eating smoked fish (Panla) and cow skin (ponmo) for months, and it means I’d have to return to cow skin sellers’ stalls, anyway,” she said, her teary voice barely concealing her frustration.

The impact of the economic policies executed by the Bola Tinubu administration, particularly the removal of petrol subsidies and the devaluation of the naira, has made it difficult for millions of Nigerians like Mrs Abayomi to buy things they could afford before Mr Tinubu assumed office in 2023.

It was a Saturday in August, and Mrs Abayomi struggled to wriggle her way out of the nutritional dilemma she faced due to the state of the economy. Paradoxically, some days earlier, in Abuja, about 740 kilometres from Ota, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala hailed the Nigerian government for stabilising the economy.

“You cannot really improve an economy unless it’s stable. So he has to be given the credit for the stability of the economy. So the reforms have been in the right direction. What is needed next is growth,” the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and former finance minister said. Her assessment of the economy has since thrown up polarising debates, with multiple interpretations among Nigerians.

In his intervention, Yemi Kale, former statistician-general and CEO of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), cautioned that while Nigeria’s economy may now be described as “stable,” it does not automatically translate to relief for citizens.

In a post shared on X, he explained that economists define a stable economy as one where major fluctuations or disruptions have ceased, allowing businesses, investors, and consumers to plan with greater confidence.

“When economists say an economy is now stable, they usually mean that the economy has reached a point where it is no longer experiencing major fluctuations or disruptions,” he said.

“In practical terms, it suggests macroeconomic indicators are steady, predictable and confidence returns, and there are no immediate crises.”

Good Numbers, Near-empty plates

Nigeria’s fiscal position has improved in recent months. But in homes and markets across the country, hardship still runs deep.

The National Bureau of Statistics recently announced that Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product stood at N372.8 trillion in 2024, following a rebasing of the economy. At the exchange rate of N1,530 to the dollar, that translates to $243 billion.

That was 29.9 per cent higher than the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s estimate of $187.6 billion.

The new data reflects a shift in the base year used to calculate GDP, from 2010 to 2019. It expands the scope of measurement to include fast-growing sectors such as fintech, the digital economy, and informal businesses.

The rebasing also improved the country’s fiscal outlook, as the public debt-to-GDP ratio fell to 39.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2025, down from earlier estimates.

This keeps the country’s debt burden below the federal government’s 40 per cent ceiling and well under the threshold recommended by the IMF and World Bank.

Annual inflation dropped to 21.88 per cent in July 2025, down from 33.40 per cent recorded a year earlier. Food inflation, which has caused the greatest strain on households, also stood at 22.74 per cent year-on-year in July, compared to 39.53 per cent in the same month last year.

The naira has held steady recently, trading at N1,535 to the dollar in the official market, following devaluation exercises.

Similarly, banks have resumed international transactions on naira debit cards for the first time in three years, following improved dollar liquidity and confidence in the forex market.

Global credit rating agencies have equally responded to the changes. Moody’s, for instance, upgraded Nigeria’s issuer rating from ‘Caa1’ to ‘B3’ with a stable outlook, citing reforms in foreign exchange policy and improved external reserves.

Caa1 means Nigeria was seen as very risky, with a high chance it might struggle to repay its debts, while B3 means the risk is still high, but Nigeria is doing better and is now seen as slightly more likely to meet its debt obligations.

The IMF, in its latest Article IV Consultation, also praised the country’s recent steps to address longstanding structural problems, including fuel subsidy removal and unification of exchange rates. The article is a yearly review through which the IMF assesses a country’s economic and financial policies and advises to support stability, growth, and development.

“The government’s tax reforms will make it easier to pay taxes and ensure that everyone who owes taxes pays them,” the report said. “Over time, once the ongoing cost-of-living crisis abates and the cash transfer system is fully operational, there will be room to align tax rates.”

But despite the positive outlook in the fiscal position, for many Nigerians, these gains remain quite illusory.

“We don’t see this improvement they talk about,” said Maryam Musa, a market trader in Kaduna. “People still buy food in bits. Nobody buys in bulk anymore.”

Martha Philips, a civil servant in Abuja, now buys only small portions of what she needs because her salary can no longer cover bulk purchases.

“I like buying in bulk: rice, gari, oil, and even protein. I usually share cartons of chicken and fish at Kado Fish Market,” she said. “But prices have skyrocketed, and my salary didn’t skyrocket with them. I can’t spend all my money on one item, so I just spread it and buy things kilo by kilo at the neighbourhood market.”

For many households, the drop in inflation has not translated into relief. Prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace, and purchasing power has eroded after years of high inflation and stagnant incomes.

Insecurity, climate shocks, and rising input costs have disrupted food production across rural Nigeria, undermining the government’s efforts to bring down prices. Though President Bola Tinubu declared a state of emergency on food insecurity in 2023, food inflation remained high through most of 2024.

Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Nigeria has kept its benchmark interest rate at 27.5 per cent, after a series of hikes aimed at reining in inflation. It says holding the rate steady will help anchor expectations and consolidate recent gains.

Macro-Micro Disconnect

Despite real GDP growth of 3.38 per cent in 2024 and a growing sense of optimism among investors, unemployment remains high. In many areas, families say their incomes are falling short of even basic needs.

“Everything costs more now, but our incomes haven’t changed,” said Chidi Okonkwo, a civil servant in Abuja. “This so-called growth doesn’t reach us.”

Mr Okonkwo said he can no longer afford basic food items in the quantities he used to buy. He explained that despite government claims of economic recovery, high prices and stagnant wages have left many families struggling to cope.

“It’s hard to see the progress they talk about when you’re cutting down on meals just to make it to the end of the month,” he added.

Paul Alaje, senior economist at SPM Professionals, pointed out a growing disconnect between Nigeria’s improving macroeconomic indicators and the harsh realities faced by households and businesses.

“We are seeing the numbers, the data, and saying, ‘Oh, we now have positive GDP,’” he said. “We’re also saying the trade balance is in surplus, there’s relative stability in the exchange rate, and inflation has reduced month-on-month for three consecutive months.”

However, he noted that these signals of macroeconomic recovery have not translated into better living conditions for ordinary Nigerians.

“When you now flip to the micro side, you see households groaning and complaining, and businesses are suffering. Only one component of micro, which is the government, is the agent that seems to have benefited,” he said.

He also cautioned against relying solely on GDP as a measure of national well-being: “If there are only three people in a country, and two earn N1 while one earns N10, the GDP becomes N12. But two people are still really poor. That is the limitation of GDP as a yardstick.”

To bridge the gap between macro gains and micro hardship, he called for investment in public infrastructure and services.

“The carriers of the economy from one level to another are public goods, like roads, education, energy, and health,” he said. “If the fundamentals are not there, we might be seeing positive numbers, but people may not feel a positive impact in their lives.”

In recent months, there have been concerns around public spending across all the tiers of government, and some analysts consider it bad optics for the reform agenda of the federal government.

“Less of the money is going into capital expenditure,” Mr Alaje said. “Until we start having our capital expenditure surpassing our recurrent expenditure, I’m afraid, inflation may be with us for a long time.”

Growth not relief

Aliyu Ilias, an economist with CSA Asset Advisory, explained why macroeconomic indicators such as GDP growth, declining inflation and relative stability in the foreign exchange market have not translated into better living conditions for Nigerians.

“There’s a disconnect because if you look at the macro economy, like you said, the GDP is showing up positively because of the rebase, the inflation seems to be coming down. Also, the forex seems to be stabilised. But the thing is, it cannot reflect because we have to see it for some time before we can start getting to recovery,” he said.

He cautioned against equating economic growth with poverty reduction.

“I must also disabuse our minds that we have economic growth that reflects in GDP does not mean poverty will reduce. What will actually reduce poverty is household consumption and household disposable income. As much as our disposable income is reducing, purchasing power is reducing; there is no sign, there is no hope that poverty will reduce,” Mr Ilias said.

He urged the federal government to address supply chain issues, particularly in energy.

“We must look at our supply chain. Our supply chain has to do with energy, because our energy transportation is the major problem and it is energy cost,” he said.

He also highlighted the need to tackle insecurity to improve food production. Referring to President Tinubu’s July 2023 declaration of a state of emergency on food security, Mr Ilias said: “Up till now, we have not seen the reflection. We must go back to all-season farming, because now that produce is coming out, things are reducing, and that’s what we must do.”

He criticised the assumption that border reopening would solve food access challenges.

“We must also not be mistaken for believing that once we open our border, everything will be okay,” he said. “During President Muhammadu Buhari, the gain we achieved, especially in rice production, is getting eroded, also because of the border opening. We are supposed to make our own getting better and sufficient…”

He also called for a downward review of the Central Bank’s benchmark interest rate: “The MPR is still between 27.5. We need to find a way to actually reduce the MPR to achieve a successful development in poverty reduction.”

Positive outlook

Tope Fasua, special adviser to the president on economic matters, said while hardship persists, Nigeria’s macroeconomic outlook has significantly improved.

He listed several indicators, such as slowing inflation, stable exchange rates, stronger foreign reserves, rising exports, and improved credit ratings. “Inflation is getting better, reducing… credit ratings have improved,” he said.

“Even reserves have got to $40.1 billion.”

He added that GDP growth, though modest, is positive, and states are receiving higher allocations. He said sectors like real estate, housing, and agriculture are beginning to expand.

Exports, according to Mr Fasua, are booming. Nigeria exported $2.6 billion worth of cocoa in 2024, a 200 per cent rise over 2023. He also said Nigeria now exports refined petroleum products to countries like the United States, Singapore, and Saudi Arabia.

Importation of crude has declined, he said, while local refining is improving. “The structure of the economy has changed greatly,” he said.

Mr Fasua acknowledged the cost-of-living crisis but said inflation is trending downward, from 34.8 per cent earlier this year to 22.2 per cent, and could drop to 15 per cent by year-end if current conditions persist. He attributed lower food prices to improved harvests and a cassava glut. “Garri has been reduced by 50 per cent,” he said. “That is good for the people.”

He said psychological factors and social media amplify public frustration. “There’s this disconnect, but it’s gradually bridging,” Mr Fasua said. “People are planting. People are moving around. People are getting married. People are building houses. We’re not starving to death.”

He urged the public to focus on recovery rather than fear. “People should stop living in fear. If everybody were so afraid, then we’d all starve to death, and we’re not starving to death.”

Mr Fasua also argued that poverty may be declining in areas like Ondo, Osun, and Cross River, citing cocoa earnings as one example. “Quite a number of those took a lot of people out of poverty,” he said.

He called for a shift in attitude: “Some people are sowing despair. They should be sowing hope.”

While acknowledging urban struggles and job insecurity, driven by global digital trends, he said the broader picture is improving. People must reposition themselves,” he said.

“This country is blessed… Nigeria is not doing badly as far as countries are concerned.”

Gaps

Muda Yusuf, chief executive of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, said the gap between macroeconomic gains and relief for ordinary Nigerians was not unusual.

“Normally, there is a lag between when you are able to fix a fundamental economic problem and when you begin to see results in terms of impact, either on productivity or on the welfare of the people; there’s always a lag,” he said.

He explained that the government’s first three years had been spent “fixing some key economic fundamentals” and stabilising the economy after inheriting “an economy that was already on the brink.”

But he noted that these efforts have come with “a huge cost” in the form of higher living expenses, inflation and shocks to businesses. “If these reforms are not taking place, the economy will be much worse off,” he said.

Mr Yusuf urged authorities at all levels to now focus on targeted actions to tackle everyday costs, improve infrastructure and boost productivity.

“Apart from dealing with the macroeconomic issues, which is very good because you can’t build something on nothing, I think the government needs to now move to tackling these specific issues of economic governance,” he said.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/business-data/814948-nigerias-economy-stabilises-but-nigerians-are-still-hungry.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"Oando Achieves 63% production growth, posts ₦1.72 trillion revenue half year 2025","Africa’s leading indigenous energy solutions provider, Oando, has published its unaudited results for the six months ended 30 June 2025. The company’s upstream business recorded strong production performance with a 63% year-on-year growth, averaging 37,012 boepd in H1 2025.

This includes crude oil production up 77% to 10,479 bopd, gas volumes up 54% to 25,399 boepd, and NGL production up 375% to 1,135 bpd. The company attributes this performance to the consolidation of the NAOC JV interest and improved uptime across key assets.

The Oando Group reported revenue of ₦1.72 trillion, representing a 15% decline driven by lower trading activity and weaker realised prices, despite stronger upstream contributions. Gross Profit fell by 28% to ₦59 billion, reflecting both a topline contraction and changing segment mix. Nevertheless, the company maintained a Profit-After-Tax of N63 billion, consistent with the result recorded in H1, 2024.

Following its recent acquisition of Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC) from Italian oil giant Eni, the company has focused heavily on infrastructure upgrades, production optimisation, and integration of the NAOC asset base, leading to an increase in capital expenditures of ₦44 billion. Additionally, Oando’s commitment to safety is demonstrated by achieving zero lost-time injuries (LTIs) and recording 12.3 million LTI-free hours, underscoring its continued excellence in HSE performance.

The trading subsidiary increased its crude oil liftings to 14 cargoes (12.9 MMbbl) in H1 2025, compared to 10 cargoes (10.6 MMbbl) in H1 2024, reflecting improved offtake execution.

Speaking on the 2025 half-year results, Group Chief Executive, Oando PLC, Wale Tinubu (CON), commented, “In H1 2025, we advanced our growth agenda in our upstream division, the primary driver of the Group’s performance, by achieving a 63% year-on-year increase in production volumes. This was driven by the successful consolidation of NAOC’s assets, early gains from our optimisation programme and our assumption of operatorship, which enabled us to implement holistic security measures amid improved community relations, resulting in enhanced infrastructure reliability, higher production volumes, and greater operational resilience.”

“Our trading segment faced headwinds which exerted pressure on the entity’s revenue and the Group’s topline as a result of declining PMS imports into the country due to rising local refining capacity from Dangote Refinery, a positive development that enhances Nigeria’s energy security and self-sufficiency. In response, we diversified our crude offtake sources, optimised trade flows, and expanded into LNG and metals. These initiatives are already gaining traction and will support stronger performance in H2.” He added.

Similarly, another independent player, Aradel Holdings Plc, released its H1, 2025 unaudited financials and reported revenue of ₦368.1 billion, up 37.2% and Profit after Tax of ₦146.4 billion, up 40.2% driven by stable average production volumes.

Additional highlights in the first half of the year include the company securing operatorship of Block KON 13 in Angola, marking its strategic entry into the Kwanza Basin and a significant step in expanding its upstream footprint in Africa.

Looking ahead, Oando is preparing for capital restructuring initiatives, including an equity raise and debt conversions, which it plans to present at the upcoming Annual General Meeting and Extraordinary General Meeting scheduled to hold in August.

These plans follow the successful upsizing of the RBL 2 facility to $375 million, strengthening its financial flexibility to accelerate development of the Group’s expanded 1 billion boe upstream portfolio.

Looking forward, Mr Tinubu remarked, “As we enter the second half of the year, our priorities are clear: accelerate upstream monetisation through drilling and production assurance, strengthen trading performance, and execute our capital restructuring initiatives to restore balance sheet flexibility. With a focused strategy and a clear execution roadmap, we remain committed to delivering sustained value to our shareholders.”

Oando has set its sights on maintaining full-year production of 30,000–40,000 boepd, driven by a balanced capital program of 3 new wells and 6 rig-less interventions. The company’s trading guidance includes 25–35 MMbbl crude oil and 750,000–1,000,000 MT refined products.

Additionally, Oando projects capex of $250–270 million focused on drilling, infrastructure, and ESG projects, with a 20% cost reduction goal.

From Crypto to Currency: Stablecoins as the Future of Payments,"Narrow banking is a concept first proposed by the Chicago School economists and was brought up again during the savings and loan crisis. It advocates for the separation of main banking functions, encompassing two primary categories of institutions:

Narrow Banks: These financial institutions offer fully guaranteed deposits with premium liquid assets, such as Treasury Bills or Central Bank Reserves. Functionally similar to money market funds, they are primarily designed for payment purposes.

Merchant Banks: These entities engage in lending through equity or long-term bonds, thereby insulating themselves from the risks associated with bank runs.

Supporters, like Marvin Barth, claim that stablecoins can successfully implement limited banking’s tenets. A 1:1 backing of stablecoins with premium liquid assets is required by recent legislative measures like the GENIUS and STABLE Acts, which also encourage comprehensive audits and present stablecoins in a manner akin to that of regular deposits. Also, Decentralised finance (DeFi) and traditional monetary systems are meant to be more closely aligned.

Present Situation: Political Dynamics and Technology

DeFi’s growing popularity has led to a notable increase in stablecoin usage in cryptocurrency ecosystems, enabling globally distributed and programmable payment systems. A growing mistrust of big banks, powerful lobbying from the cryptocurrency industry, and a national strategic interest in thwarting China’s aspirations in digital currency development have all contributed to the significant bipartisan political interest in this field. The US Treasury Secretary has emphasised the potential for stablecoin-backed purchases of Treasury bills.

Transition Challenges and Limitations

Transitioning to a full-reserve narrow banking system would necessitate substantial asset sales or a contraction of credit, which could lead to a significant credit crunch. Due to the influence of established banking interests, there is a tendency for political opposition persistence.

Furthermore, current legislative efforts do not yet provide stablecoin issuers with direct access to the Federal Reserve, potentially safeguarding existing banking structures. However, recognising Federal Reserve reserves as high-quality liquid assets suggests a possible long-term alignment with narrow banking principles.

Implications and Strategic Considerations

The move towards a narrow banking model involving stablecoins presents both opportunities and challenges:

Beneficiaries: Consumers and businesses can anticipate low-cost, programmable payment solutions, while merchant lenders may gain from increased regulatory clarity. The United States could also experience an expansion of Treasury bill markets.

Impacted Entities: Traditional fractional-reserve banks may contend with a diminished deposit base and increased competition within the payment sector, which could prompt realignment in the industry. On a global scale, the establishment of a robust US stablecoin standard may strengthen the resilience of international payment systems against competing regimes, such as China. Given the United States’ extensive bond and shadow banking sectors, it is particularly well-positioned to adopt the principles of narrow banking without destabilising its credit markets.

Broader Implications and Risks

Following the introduction of the GENIUS Act, which enforces full-reserve backing and audit requirements, the stablecoin market has grown significantly and recently achieved a market capitalisation of $252 billion. However, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has cautioned that stablecoins may not meet essential criteria such as consistent valuation, flexible supply, and compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) regulations, categorising them as risky in the absence of central bank oversight.

Major fintech companies, including Fiserv and Mastercard, are innovating payment solutions that utilise regulated stablecoins, which makes the competitive landscape of financial institutions to change . As regulatory frameworks advance in the United States, they stand in contrast to a more careful international perspective focused on monetary stability.

Conclusion

Mr Barth sees stablecoins as a tangible rebirth of limited banking that merges economic strategy, political drive, and technology breakthroughs. Regulatory structures, such as access to the Federal Reserve, are still lacking, and there are still inherent hazards, as the BIS has pointed out, which makes its future complicated. There might also be difficulties due to opposition from traditional financial institutions. Stablecoins have the potential to drastically alter credit arrangements, payment methods, and the whole international monetary system if handled properly.

"Police foil fake ‘Obi of Lagos’ installation, arrest four","The Lagos State Police Command says it has arrested a man who paraded himself as the “Obi of Lagos” along with three accomplices, disrupting a plan to unveil a N1.5 billion “palace” in Amuwo Odofin area of the state.

In a statement posted on X on Wednesday, the command’s deputy spokesperson, Babasuyi Oluseyi, identified the principal suspect as 65-year-old Chibuike Azubike, an indigene of Obodoukwu in Ideato North Local Government Area of Imo State.

He was arrested alongside 57-year-old Chibuzor Ani, 65-year-old Martins Nwaodika, and 41-year-old Ikechukwu Franklin Nnadi.

According to the police, intelligence revealed that the suspects planned to unveil a prototype of a purported Palace of Obi of Lagos State and celebrate an Ofala/new yam festival on Saturday, 13 September, at Apple Hall, Amuwo Odofin.

“Acting on this information, the police promptly sealed off the venue in order to forestall any breach of the peace and to protect unsuspecting members of the public from being misled,” Mr Oluseyi said.

He added that tactical teams, including the Eko Strike Force, were deployed to ensure the event did not hold.

An invitation card obtained by the police described the programme as the unveiling of the “N1.5 billion Palace of Obi of Lagos State and the celebration of the first Ofala/new yam festival.”

The Commissioner of Police, Olohundare Jimoh, urged residents to be vigilant against impostors who exploit revered cultural institutions for personal gain.

He said such actions are illegal under the Obas and Chiefs Law of Lagos State (2015) and capable of disturbing public order.

The police said investigations into the suspects’ activities are ongoing and that they will be charged to court.

Unrecognised titles

Disputes over unrecognised titles have been a recurring issue in Lagos. State law does not recognise the Eze Ndigbo title, which is sometimes claimed by Igbo community leaders.

According to the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, parading oneself as an Eze Ndigbo without recognition is punishable by up to two years in prison under the Obas and Chiefs Law (2015).

Earlier, the Lagos State Government arraigned Frederick Nkemdilim Nwajago, the self-styled Eze Ndigbo of Ajao Estate, on terrorism charges after he was accused of parading himself as a traditional ruler without state approval.

The South East Council of Traditional Rulers has also advised against the use of such titles outside Igboland.

The state government is currently reviewing the Obas and Chiefs Law to modernise traditional governance and address abuses of chieftaincy titles.

Also, the Attorney General and Commissioner of Justice Lawal Pedro (SAN) said in June that the reforms aim to strengthen respect for traditional rulers while aligning the institution with contemporary governance.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/820303-police-foil-fake-obi-of-lagos-installation-arrest-four.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Police arrest fake army colonel in Ondo,"The Ondo State Police Command says it has apprehended one Abdullahi Saliu of Top Quality Hotel, who notoriously paraded himself as a colonel in the Nigerian Army.

The command also said the suspect deceitfully lured and defrauded two unsuspecting victims, Oshoade Janet ‘f’ and Daisi Remilekun Joy ‘f’, under the false pretext of securing employment opportunities for their sons in the Nigeria Customs Service and Nigerian Immigration Services.

“Through this fraudulent scheme, he obtained the sum of One Million, Three Hundred and Seventy-Seven Thousand Naira (₦1,377,000), which he subsequently converted to his personal use,” a statement by police spokesperson, Olayinka Ayanlade, said on Tuesday.

“Investigations further revealed that the suspect’s operations cut across state lines, with victims traced to Edo, Delta, Kogi, and Ondo States.

“He has long been on the Command’s watchlist as a notorious job racketeer, known for impersonating senior officers of different security agencies. His disguise and fraudulent claims include presenting himself variously as a colonel in the Nigerian Army, a Naval officer, a senior Immigration and Customs officer, among others, all in a bid to defraud unsuspecting citizens of their hard-earned money.”

The suspect has since been arraigned before Magistrate Court 1 for appropriate prosecution.

This feat represents one of the several cases successfully cracked by the command in recent times.

The command reaffirmed its commitment to protecting the lives, property, and interests of all residents, while ensuring that fraudsters and criminally-minded elements are brought to justice.

Four days ago, the command arrested a suspected fraudster allegedly behind a fake admission syndicate targeting the Nigeria Police Academy (POLAC), Wudil, Kano.

The suspect, identified as Samson Owolade, a native of Ipogun in Akure, was apprehended following credible intelligence linking him to a scam involving fraudulent admission offers, misleading social media posts, and online platforms designed to defraud aspiring cadets.

Investigations revealed that Mr Owolade created and managed a WhatsApp group titled “NPA RC12 Guide and Updates” with over 370 members, at least 100 of whom are believed to have fallen victim to the scheme.

He was also found to be behind a Facebook page, “POLAC UPDATES GROUP,” used to spread false information and defamatory content against the Police Academy.

Operatives of the Cybercrime Unit later tracked and arrested the suspect within an hour. A preliminary investigation led to the recovery of several mobile phones, laptops, internet routers, and SIM cards allegedly used in the fraud.

There are indications that the suspect will be transferred to the POLAC for further investigation and prosecution, even as Mr Ayanlade said efforts were ongoing to track down other members of the syndicate.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-west/820288-police-arrest-fake-army-colonel-in-ondo.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"Lagos govt warns estate developers against non-compliance with land designations, other violations","The Lagos State Government has issued a fresh warning to estate developers against bypassing planning regulations and misusing land designated for other purposes.

The warning came about a month after the government publicly listed 176 “illegal” estates operating approved layouts.

Speaking during a stakeholder briefing in Lagos on Wednesday, the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Oluyinka Olumide, said recent inspections revealed widespread non-compliance in several areas, especially Ibeju-Lekki, Eti-Osa, and adjoining communities.

According to him, many developers have been converting agricultural and industrial land into residential estates without securing the necessary layout and planning approvals. Some of these illegally partitioned lands, he noted, have already been sold to Nigerians in the diaspora despite their unsuitability for housing development.

He stated that tracts of land were not endorsed for use by the ministry and would not get the necessary planning packages .

“Before you go into estate development, you are supposed to obtain your layout approval. And what we’ve seen so far, particularly around Lekki axis, Eti-osa, and Ibeju-lekki area is that people have gone to purchase those (parcels of) land for the purpose of estate development.

“A lot of money has been committed into this area, and it will be difficult for those people to come back and say they want to show up in that area, because they will not be able to get a planning package out of that,” he said.

Mr Olumide said the ministry recently issued public notices to offending developers, giving them 21 working days to obtain approvals. While some have complied, the commissioner warned that others risk having their estates sealed and declared illegal.

“We went out very aggressively, and we collated some estates, even the cases of some that actually commenced the processes, but they did not finish it all. And that was why we went out and we made that publication.

“And we gave them 21 working days to enable them to effect the regularization of their various approvals. Some of them have responded, and we are already commencing the process of collecting all the approvals,” he said.

PREMIUM TIMES reported how the Lagos State Government listed 176 “illegal estates” without layout approvals in its domains in the state in August. The government issued a 21-day ultimatum to their developers and promoters to regularise their operations by obtaining proper layout approvals.

Lower threshold for approval

Mr Olumide also disclosed the ministry has begun a process to recognise houses that were originally built independently but have now come together to operate as estates, particularly for security and community management purposes.

He explained that modalities have been mapped out to reassess and approve such requests, stressing that the move will help regularise developments and ensure better planning.

Previously, only developments on a minimum of one hectare of land (10,000 square metres) qualified for layout approval for estate development. However, with the growing influx of residents into estate development, the ministry has now reduced the threshold to 5,000 square metres.

“With the current influx and move into estate development, we are reducing that now to 5,000 square meters. So, if you have a development now on a land of 5,000 square meters and above, you will be qualified to have a layout approved before you go into the independent planning permit,” he said.

The commissioner also highlighted the importance of producing guiding documents such as regional plans and model city plans, which serve as critical frameworks for regulating estate development across the state.

According to him, these planning documents remain key to guiding its activities and ensuring orderly growth within residential communities.

Lagos’ illegal estate problem

Lagos, Nigeria commercial nerve centre is experiencing a boom in estate development to cater to the city’s rising population. However, this expansion is often at the expense of lands ear marked for agricultural and industrial purposes.

PREMIUM TIMES had reported that the state government declared 176 estates “illegal” for not possessing an approved layout. The developers were issued a 21-day ultimatum to regularise their operations or face sanctions.

Beyond the encroachment on scarce farmlands, poorly planned estates often create additional problems such as flooding, disrupted drainage systems, and blocked waterways. Also, individuals who invest in these estates face disputes and litigation when these properties are eventually demolished.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-west/820188-lagos-govt-warns-estate-developers-against-non-compliance-with-land-designations-other-violations.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Owo Church Massacre: Court rejects five suspected assailants’ bail application,"The Federal High Court in Abuja on Wednesday rejected the bail application of five men standing trial for the June 2022 massacre in a church in Owo, Ondo State.

At least 40 worshippers were killed and over 100 others injured in the attack on the church.

Trial judge Emeka Nwite ruled that the suspected assailants’ bail application lacked merit. He also ruled that they could not be granted bail considering the gravity of the offences and the strength of evidence against them.

“The seriousness of the offence, the nature and strength of the evidence, and the likelihood of interference with witnesses are matters this court cannot gloss over,” he held.

The judge added that, considering the number of casualties and injuries resulting from the church attack alleged in the case against them, “granting bail in these circumstances poses a judicial risk.”

He agreed with the prosecution that there was compelling evidence that the defendants might jump bail, considering their alleged links with foreign terrorist groups.

“In the interest of justice, the bail application is refused for lacking in merit,” he ruled.

The defendants, charged with five counts of terrorism, are Idris Abdulmalik Omeiza (25 years old), Al Qasim Idris (20 years old), Jamiu Abdulmalik (26 years old), Abdulhaleem Idris (25 years old) and Momoh Otuho Abubakar (47 years old).

They were arraigned on 11 August over the 5 June 2022 terror attack on St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State. They all pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Their lawyer subsequently applied for the defendants’ bail, arguing during 19 August hearing that they were presumed innocent. He also assured the judge that the defendants would always attend court for their trial and would not interfere with prosecution witnesses.

Defence lawyer Abdullahi Mohammad told the judge that the defendants had been in custody since their arrest in 2022 and were ready to present reliable sureties for their proposed bail

However, the prosecution in a counter-affidavit opposed the bail on grounds, including the defendants’ alleged links to foreign terrorist groups like Al-Shabab. The prosecution also said their accomplices were still at large, constituting a threat to prosecution witnesses.

Prosecution lawyer Calistus Eze called on the judge to throw out the bail applications, citing the seriousness of the terrorism charges, the severity of the prescribed punishment, the strong evidence against the applicants, the likelihood of absconding, and possible intimidation of witnesses.

“Presumption of innocence not enough’

Ruling on Wednesday, the judge rejected the defence’s reliance on the presumption of innocence in their bail application.

Although, the Nigerian constitution presumes an accused person innocent until proven guilty, the judge said, the right is not absolute. “In a bail application, all factors must be considered,” he said.

He added that the court must consider established other factors, including the nature of the charge, severity of punishment, strength of evidence, criminal record, likelihood of attendance at trial, and risk of interference with witnesses.

The judge stressed that the likelihood was high that the suspects could interfere with the trial if granted bail, noting that they did not oppose the claims in the prosecution’s counter-affidavit that they could abscond from trial, intimidate witnesses and commit more crimes if their application was granted.

He said facts not opposed “are believed to be true.”

Mr Nwite cited some of the claims in the prosecution’s counter-affidavit unopposed by the defence to include the fact that defendants’ accomplices were still walking free and making frantic efforts to interfere with and compromise prosecution witnesses and trial.

He also noted the fear expressed by prosecution witnesses and their cry for protection as a condition to appear in court. The judge recalled that following intimidation of the proposed witnesses from the people connected to defendants, the prosecution had to apply for the shielding of the witnesses’ faces while giving evidence.

He also alluded to the possibility of the defendants committing other crimes if released on bail.

He cited sections 162 and 163 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015, which provides that a defendant can be denied bail if there is “a reasonable ground that he will commit another offence, jump trial, interfere in the case, attempt to conceal evidence, or undermine the purpose of criminal justice administration.”

The judge also pointed out that while there five defendants standing trial, only the first defendant’s name was stated on the motion paper, with the others included by reference.

He held that each applicant was required to file a separate affidavit stating reasons why bail should be granted. He held the joint application as filed was “incompetent.”

Road contracts below N20billion to be awarded to local firms – Minister,"The Nigerian government has directed that Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd (NNPC) Tax Credit road contracts below N20 billion be awarded to local contractors.

The Minister of Works, David Umahi, gave the directive during an inspection visit to the ongoing dualisation of the East-West Road (Section IIIA) from Eleme Junction, Port Harcourt, to Onne Junction in Rivers State on Tuesday.

In a statement published on the ministry’s website on Tuesday, Mr Umahi said the announcement was in line with Nigeria’s First Policy.

In May this year, President Bola Tinubu issued Nigeria’s First policy directive, aimed at prioritising locally made goods and services in all government procurement to boost local production and reduce reliance on imported items.

Mr Umahi directed federal controllers of works nationwide to enforce stricter supervision and warned that contracts below N20billion would no longer be awarded to expatriate firms.

The minister said that although NNPC had stopped direct funding of tax credit projects, Mr Tinubu ordered that ongoing projects must continue.

“To this end, the ministry has compiled and prioritised inherited projects, focusing on those along key economic corridors.”

Mr Umahi said the move aligns with the president’s directive that all inherited NNPC-funded projects must continue without interruption.

He said the ministry had compiled all projects inherited from NNPC and submitted them to the president.

The minister said that those along national economic corridors, such as the Eleme–Onne Road, would receive top priority.

“Mr President has graciously directed that none of such works should stop,” he said.

The works minister used the inspection visit to caution contractors against poor construction methods.

He pointed out the practice of laying binder courses without covering them with a wearing course for months, which weakens roads and accelerates failure.

Mr Umahi lauded Reynolds Construction Company for the quality of work on the Eleme–Onne project, but expressed disappointment with the slow pace, saying the rainfall was no excuse.

Background

On 1 August, NNPC halted funding for road projects under the Tax Credit Scheme.

To prevent abandonment, Mr Umahi said in August that President Tinubu directed the ministry to explore alternative funding models.

The Federal Ministry of Works included in its Tuesday statement that it has adopted a funding prioritisation framework to ensure the continued execution of road projects.

A funding prioritisation framework is a structured system for evaluating projects, programmes, or initiatives to decide which ones receive limited funding based on defined criteria.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/820310-road-contracts-below-n20billion-to-be-awarded-to-local-firms-minister.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Reps move to replace moribund coal corporation with new commission,"The House of Representatives on Thursday took a major step towards reviving Nigeria’s moribund coal industry with a public hearing on a bill seeking to repeal the Nigerian Coal Corporation Act, Cap. 95, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, and replace it with the Nigerian Coal Development Commission.

The bill, titled “A Bill for an Act to Repeal the Nigerian Coal Corporation Act and Enact the Nigerian Coal Development Commission Enugu and for Related Matters (HB.667),” is sponsored by Chimaobi Atu (APC, Enugu).

The bill had scaled second reading in March and was thereafter committed to the Committee on Solid Minerals Development for further legislative action.

Speaking at the hearing, Mr Atu noted that the creation of a new commission was crucial to reviving the country’s once-thriving coal industry, which provided substantial revenue before and after independence but has since collapsed.

“The Nigerian Coal Industry, which provided a chunk of the country’s revenue before and after independence, is now moribund and there is a need to revive it. This bill, when passed into law, will also end illegal coal mining activities in the country,” he said.

He noted that the timing of the legislation aligns with Nigeria’s renewed international partnerships, pointing to President Bola Tinubu’s recent signing of nine bilateral agreements with Brazil, one of which focused on coal’s role in science and power.

According to Mr Atu, Nigeria’s coal deposits are estimated at 2.8 billion metric tons, concentrated mainly in Enugu, Kogi, and Benue states.

He noted that “clean coal” from these regions is particularly vital for steel production and could catalyse industrial and manufacturing revival.

Stakeholders back bill

At the public hearing, organised by the House Committee on Solid Minerals Development, stakeholders unanimously supported the bill, describing the Nigerian Coal Corporation as obsolete and incapable of meeting modern challenges.

Chibuokem Kenechukwu, managing director of RockThermal Ltd, said the existing corporation had failed to regulate the sector, paving the way for unregulated and illegal mining across Enugu, Benue, and Kogi states.

He said, “The existing Nigerian Coal Corporation has become largely ineffective and moribund, unable to fulfill its mandate of developing Nigeria’s coal resources. This institutional failure has resulted in illegal mining activities across Enugu, Benue, and Kogi states, conducted without proper oversight, environmental standards, or structured benefit to the nation.

“These unregulated operations not only deprive the government of legitimate revenue but also pose significant environmental and safety risks to local communities,” he added.

Mr Kenechukwu also urged that the commission be headquartered in Enugu, which has the nation’s largest proven coal reserves and existing infrastructure.

“We strongly support establishing the commission headquarters in Enugu State, given that it contains the largest proven coal reserves in Nigeria, has decades of institutional memory and expertise in coal mining, and possesses existing infrastructure and educational resources that support effective coal development oversight,” he said.

Offering an insider’s perspective, Godwin Alo, who represented the Nigerian Mining and Geosciences Society (NMGS), recalled starting his career in the coal sector in 1998 at Okaba Mines in Kogi State.

He explained that previous privatisation attempts, managed through the Bureau of Public Enterprises, had failed to attract sustained investment, despite interest from major multinational companies.

He said, “There was a bidding process that attracted some of the world’s biggest mining firms, but somehow that bidding process got installed along the line. If not, that industry even without this commission would have gone ahead and developed.

Mr Alo stressed that the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency (NGSA) remains central to coal development, as the custodian of mineral data dating back to the early 1900s.

Taslim Jimoh, a mining consultant with Dangote Industries Ltd, highlighted the importance of coal to Nigeria’s cement industry, which consumes more than 90 per cent of the country’s current coal output.

“We even take coal from Kogi to as far as Sokoto to power the power plant there. So, such is the importance of coal as an energy alternative for us,” he said.

Mr Jimoh said coal is more than an energy source for cement but a strategic industrial raw material that underpins Nigeria’s construction and infrastructure drive.

Mr Jimoh further noted that several coal assets earlier concessioned by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) were either abandoned or returned by investors who could not manage them, leaving once-productive sites such as the Onyeama and Okpara mines in Enugu State completely flooded and dormant.

Reviving these mines, he stressed, would require significant technical expertise and capital investment, far beyond the capacity of individual operators.

According to him, only a structured federal intervention through a specialised commission can mobilise the scale of resources needed to rehabilitate such strategic but neglected coalfields.

“There are coal deposits that the BPE concessioned and the people who took them over returned them, they couldn’t handle them.

These are the coal in Enugu, Onyeama and Okpara mines which are flooded now. It takes a lot of technical expertise and funding to revive those mines,” he said.

He also highlighted the significance of underground coal reserves, which, unlike open-cast mining, cause minimal environmental disruption and could be mined beneath communities without displacing residents.

For Mr Jimoh, the proposed commission represents more than another regulatory body but a potential driver of Nigeria’s industrialisation agenda.

Next steps

The Chairperson of the Committee, Gaza Gbefwi, assured participants that all submissions from the hearing would be considered before the committee presents its report for further deliberation.

Why a new commission?

The Nigerian Coal Corporation Act was originally enacted in 1950 to establish the Nigerian Coal Corporation and transfer all government-owned colliery operations to it.

For decades, the corporation oversaw coal exploration and mining, making the mineral one of Nigeria’s most valuable resources before the sector collapsed due to neglect, poor investment, and failed privatisation.

The bill now proposes the establishment of the Nigerian Coal Development Commission, to be headquartered in Enugu, with wide-ranging mandates including:",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/820402-reps-move-to-replace-moribund-coal-corporation-with-new-commission.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"Man, 35, remanded for allegedly raping friend’s five-year-old girl","The Children, Sexual and Gender-based Violence Offences Court in Awka, Anambra State, has ordered the remand of a 35-year-old civil servant, Joseph Chigbo, in a correctional centre for allegedly raping a five-year-old girl.

The Magistrate, U.E. Onochie, ordered the remand of Mr Chigbo after his arraignment on a one-count charge of defilement.

She adjourned the case until 8 December for the hearing.

Earlier, the prosecutor, Chinyere Okechukwu, a police inspector, told the court that the defendant allegedly committed the offence on 13 July at Ezinifite in Aguata Local Government of Anambra State.

Ms Okeckukwu told the court that the case was reported on 13 July by the father of the five-year-old girl.

“He stated that he was in his backyard washing breadfruit on the said date when he heard his friend, the defendant, talking with his daughter.

“After a while, he realised he could no longer hear their voices. Concerned, he went to check and discovered that the door to his room was open.

“He said he went in and saw his friend naked and holding his penis while his daughter was lying naked on the bed.

“After medical examination at the General Hospital Ekwulobia, a medical practitioner confirmed that the girl had been defiled,” she said.

She said the offences contravened Sections 130(2) (a) (b) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law 2022.

The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge.

"Security operatives raid criminal hideout, arrest two, recover arms","A combined team of security operatives in Enugu State, Nigeria’s South-east, have arrested two crime suspects and recovered arms and ammunition in multiple operations in the state.

The police spokesperson in the state, Daniel Ndukwe, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday.

Mr Ndukwe, a superintendent of police, said the suspects were arrested during the operations in the state.

He said arms and ammunition were recovered when security operatives raided a criminal hideout during the operations.

The operations

Mr Ndukwe said the multiple operations began on 3 September when operatives from Umabor Divisional Police Headquarters rescued and then arrested a 23-year-old man, Collins Ugwu, accused of threatening another man with a rifle.

He said the operation was carried out in collaboration with local vigilantes in the area.

“The suspect further confessed to membership of the Black Axe Confraternity,” the police spokesperson said.

“One locally fabricated double-barrelled pistol loaded with a live cartridge was recovered from him.”

Mr Ndukwe said, in another operation on 5 September, police operatives from Abakpa Division arrested a 26-year-old man, Peter Kalu, for allegedly causing “public disturbance”.

He said the suspect was arrested when the operatives were conducting their night patrol at about 11:05 p.m. in the area.

“A search conducted on him led to the recovery of a locally fabricated imitation pistol,” he said.

Mr Ndukwe said, in a separate operation on 6 September, police operatives from the Anti-Cultism Tactical Squad raided a criminal hideout in Ameke Ngwo, a community in Udi Local Government Area of the state.

The spokesperson said the operation, which was conducted in collaboration with members of the Neighbourhood Watch Group, followed a tip-off on the activities of the suspects.

“On sighting the operatives, a group of suspected criminals fled, abandoning a bag.

A search of the bag led to the recovery of two locally fabricated firearms: one triple-barreled pistol and one single-barreled pistol,” he said.

Mr Ndukwe stressed that “these operational breakthroughs” were part of the “sustained efforts” of the police in the state to rid Enugu State of criminality.

“Further discreet investigations into the cases are ongoing, while the arrested suspects will be arraigned in court upon conclusion of investigations,” he assured.

Commissioner speaks

Mr Ndukwe said the Commissioner of Police in Enugu State, Bitrus Giwa, has commended the operatives for their swift responses and successful operations.

Mr Giwa reassured residents of Enugu State that the police in the state were committed to sustained operations against criminals.

The police commissioner urged the residents to remain law-abiding, vigilant, and support the police with “timely provision of credible information.”

Prohibited in Nigeria

Illegal possession of firearms is outlawed in Nigeria. Firearms Act 1959 and the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Act (2004) remain the principal legislation against the illegal possession of firearms.

The Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Act (2004) prescribes a 10-year jail term for persons convicted of the offence.

However, a legislation proposed by Nigeria’s National Assembly includes a five-year jail term for firearms possession without a license.

Like the illegal possession of firearms, cultism, also known as secret societies, is outlawed in Nigeria.

However, the laws vary from state to state. In Enugu State, for instance, cultism is outlawed in the Public Order (Prohibition of Secret Cults and their activities) Law No. 17 of the Enugu State of Nigeria 2009.

It is also outlawed in the Criminal Code, Cap. 30, Vol II Revised Laws of Enugu State of Nigeria 2004.

Several persons have been convicted in Nigeria for offences of illegal possession of firearms and cultism across Nigeria.

In July 2021, a Magistrate Court in Lokoja, Kogi State, sentenced a student of Kogi State Polytechnic, Shehu Mohammed, to eight years’ imprisonment for illegal possession of a firearm and cultism.

Kaduna targets 5m children for measles-rubella vaccination,"The Kaduna State Government has announced a large-scale immunisation campaign targeting over five million children across all 23 local government areas of the state.

According to Abdullahi Musa, the State Incident Manager at the Primary Health Care Development Agency, the campaign will focus on protecting children from Measles- Rubella, and Polio.

Speaking during a media orientation session at the Primary Health Care Board in Kaduna on Thursday, Mr Musa emphasised the importance of the vaccination drive in reducing the prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases.

He said the mass immunisation effort is a crucial step towards improving child health outcomes and achieving herd immunity within the state.

According to him, the exercise, which will run from 16-27 October, is part of a nationwide effort to protect children from vaccine-preventable diseases and to strengthen the country public healthcare system.

He added that the State Primary Health Care Agency would adopt the integrated vaccination campaign approach to ensure that five million children and adolescents are vaccinated against measles- rubella and polio.

According to him, the vaccination campaign targets children aged nine months to 14 years, citing the negative effects of measles and rubella among children during the upcoming integrated supplemental immunisation activities campaign.

He said the integrated immunisation approach is more potent, cost-effective, and highly efficient.

He expressed satisfaction with the integrated vaccine similar to the routine vaccines for its safety.

‎He also said the combination of measles and rubella vaccines significantly improved the efficacy of immunisation, raising protection levels from 85 per cent to 95 per cent.

“Measles and rubella are different viruses that manifest similar symptoms, except that rubella presents mild symptoms.

He added that the Measles Rubella vaccine is safe and effective.

The incident manager assured the public of the vaccine’s safety and urged nursing mothers to ensure their children participated in the exercise to improve their health status.

‎Also speaking, the Director of Disease Control and Immunisation, Hamza Ibrahim Ikara, highlighted that the measles-rubella campaign is a nationwide exercise backed by the federal government and development partners.

‎

‎Mr Ibrahim Ikara noted that measles and rubella remain significant public health concerns, particularly in communities where vaccination rates are low.

He noted that the state government is committed to delivering essential healthcare to residents, saying that the effectiveness of integrated vaccine had been proven as potent intervention against outbreaks.

According to him, the meeting is geared towards availing journalists with the right information on the Measles Rubella, vaccine for onward dissemination to members of the public.

He noted that misinformation had been the challenge of vaccine uptakes, hence the need for the media engagement.

“We appreciate the support being rendered by media on previous immunisation exercises,” he said.

“We, therefore, call on them to kindly help sensitise residents, especially mothers and care givers to mobilise their children for this exercise.

In his remark, Ibrahim Adamu, the Supplemental Immunisation Officer with the Primary Health Care Agency, stated that fixed posts would be set up at designated points during the campaign to ensure no eligible child is left behind.

Mr Adamu explained that measles is a contagious disease that could cause fever, cough, and pneumonia, while rubella (German measles) could cause illness in children and adults.

He called on stakeholders, especially journalists, to support the campaign for massive compliance and success.

He said after the campaign, vaccines would be distributed to primary health centres across the state for effective immunisation exercise.

Court remands two persons allegedly caught with N26 million during by-election,"The Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the remand of two people allegedly arrested with N26 million cash during the last Chikun/Kajuru Federal Constituency by-election in Kaduna State.

Trial judge Emeka Nwite gave the remand order after the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arraigned the duo – Esther Ashivelli Dawaki and Shehu Fatange – on Wednesday.

They were arraigned on five counts of money laundering, involving N26 million cash allegedly meant for vote buying. The defendants denied all the charges.

They were arraigned in Abuja instead of Kaduna due to ongoing judges’ vacation. The Abuja Division of the Federal High Court was designated to hear emergency cases from Abuja and its environs during the judges’ vacation which ends later this month.

The commission said in a statement on Wednesday that its operatives arrested them on 16 August, during the by-election for Kaduna State’s Chikun/Kajuru Federal Constituency seat in the House of Representatives.

The by-election was part of 16 rerun polls conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on 16 August.

EFCC said Mr Fantage identified himself as the Director General of the campaign office of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in the Chikun/Kajuru Federal Constituency by-election.

The PDP lost the rerun poll to the All Progressives Congress (APC), which swept most of the by-elections held that day across different state and federal constituencies in many states.

How defendants were arrested

EFCC said the arrest of the defendants followed “credible intelligence that exposed them to have possessed the sum of N26,463,000.00 (Twenty-six Million Four Hundred and Sixty-three Thousand Naira).” EFCC said it suspected the money was meant for vote buying.

According to the commission, the defendants kept the money inside a Toyota Corolla 2010 model, belonging to Mr Fatange, and packed within a hotel premises in Kaduna, the Kaduna State capital.

Charges

The five charges filed against the defendants includes alleging that Ms Dawaki procured Mr Fatange to accept a cash payment of N26 million on 16 August in Kaduna, without going through a financial institution. The prosecution said the money exceeded the cash transactions limit authorised by the law. It said the act constituted an offence contrary to Section 21(C )(a) and 19(1)(d) of Money Laundering (Prevention and Prohibition) Act, 2022, and punishable under Section 19(2)(b) of the same Act.

Another count accuses Mr Fatange of directly accepting the funds from Ms Dawaki, a cash amount said to be far above legal limits. The offence is also said to be contrary to Sections 2(1)(a) and 19(1)(d) of the Money Laundering (Prevention and Prohibition) Act, 2022 and punishable under Section 19(2)(b) of the same Act.

The two defendants pleaded “not guilty” to the charges.

Remand

The prosecution counsel, M. O. Arumemi, asked the court for a trial date and for the defendants to be remanded in a correctional centre.

Defence lawyers – E. N. Ogbu and A.A. Ashat – made oral applications for their clients’ bail.

They also appealed to the court to remand their clients in EFCC custody pending determination of the bail applications.

Trial judge, Mr Nwite, ordered the remand of Ms Dawaki in the Suleja Correctional Centre and Mr Fatange in Kuje Correctional Centre.

He then adjourned the matter until 15 September for the hearing of the defendants’ bail applications.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/820271-court-remands-two-persons-allegedly-caught-with-n26-million-during-by-election.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Sokoto sets up recruitment committee,"The Sokoto State Governor, Ahmed Aliyu, has inaugurated a committee to oversee recruitments into the state civil service, in what he described as a strategic step to tackle unemployment, youth restiveness and insecurity.

The governor’s office said the measure was aimed at addressing “informants’ syndrome” – a growing problem in the state where young people provide intelligence to criminal groups – by creating meaningful opportunities for Sokoto’s youth.

In a statement issued from Government House, the director-general of media and publicity, Abubakar Bawa, said the committee would draw up recruitment criteria, review applications, conduct interviews and recommend candidates to fill vacancies across state ministries, departments and agencies.

It has one month to submit its report.

The panel is chaired by Jelani Kalgo, and includes the diplomat Sahabi Gada, former minister Bature Shinkafi, Muhammad Bello Nagwari, Ladan Ala (commissioner for basic and secondary education), Faruk A. Wurno (commissioner for health), and the permanent secretaries of the civil service and local government commissions.

Gandi Umar Muhammad will serve as secretary.

Mr Aliyu said the initiative formed part of his administration’s commitment to strengthening the state civil service and ensuring that young people were “positively engaged” rather than driven into crime.

“This measure is part of our administration’s commitment to providing meaningful employment and ensuring that Sokoto youths are productively engaged,” he said.

Observers in Sokoto welcomed the plan as a timely intervention that could ease economic pressures on households while curbing recruitment into criminal networks.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/819816-sokoto-sets-up-recruitment-committee.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"Boko Haram’s resurgence deepens complex security crisis in Nigeria, Chad, others","After being weakened by years of clashes with rival Boko Haram faction Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), Jama’tu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati wal-Jihad (JAS) is making a comeback in the Lake Chad Basin.

Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria’s intensified national counter-terrorism operations and coordinated aerial and ground assaults have slowed down ISWAP’s Camp Holocaust campaign. But the focus on ISWAP has allowed JAS to regroup and bolster itself.

Added to this is the failure of reintegration programmes to provide former insurgents with adequate support. Without meaningful future prospects, former combatants are rejoining JAS – something that ISWAP does not allow. Former ISWAP members would be executed for deserting, ex-fighters told Institute for Security Studies (ISS) researchers. In Borno, Nigeria, returnees are joining JAS’s Ghazwah wing, notorious for its robbery and ransom operations.

JAS has also successfully expanded beyond the Lake Chad region, entrenching a cell in Shiroro, near Nigeria’s capital, Abuja. The ISS has seen images showing JAS fighters moving from Shiroro to join the Lakurawa group in the Nigeria-Niger-Benin tri-border area. Sources say Lakurawa formally pledged allegiance to JAS in August.

Sites of recent JAS activity and attacks

Since June, JAS has attacked at least three military positions. On 18 June, Nigeria’s naval base at Baga was targeted, and a large cache of weapons was seized. This was initially blamed on ISWAP, but JAS later released photos to claim responsibility, signifying its competition for the spotlight.

On 2 August, JAS razed a Cameroonian military post in Goldavi near Talakatchi, seizing weapons. A week later, it attacked the Multinational Joint Task Force position in Kirawa, Gwoza, killing four soldiers. Though drones were not seen, the attacks mirrored ISWAP’s tactics in the adoption of rapid assaults. Like ISWAP, JAS also now sends out well-edited images and videos of its spectacular attacks and weapons seized.

Until these attacks, JAS violence was directed mostly at civilians. On 15 May, the group massacred about 100 residents of the neighbouring Mallam Karamti and Kwatandashi villages in Borno, accusing them of spying for ISWAP. The latest such mass killing by JAS happened on 5 September in Dar Jamal, Borno. More than 60 people were killed over allegations that they cooperated with Nigeria’s military.

These massacres illustrate the dilemma civilians face. Both insurgents and state security agencies demand intelligence about the other, but providing it, or even being suspected of doing so, invites punishment from both sides.

The targeting of civilians by JAS also involves more intense robbery and ransom attacks, including in displacement camps, ISS research shows. JAS’s Ghazwah wing is notorious for such tactics.

Meaning ‘battle’ in Arabic, Ghazwah was created by JAS fighters who rejected ISWAP after the latter took over Sambisa Forest following Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau’s death in 2021. Now led by Alhaji Kale, the wing is basically a criminal gang that rarely confronts soldiers, relying on the proceeds of crime to sustain itself.

These activities are possible within the loose command system of JAS, which, unlike ISWAP, allows units to blend criminal predation with jihadism and finance themselves independently.

ISS researchers have noted a rise in kidnappings and robberies across Mafa, Bama, Konduga, Gwoza, Mobbar and Monguno, including incursions into camps for displaced people in Bama, where resistance was met with execution. Similarly, across Cameroon’s Far North Region, the ISS documented 43 kidnapping incidents and 103 victims between June and August.

JAS uses crime as a recruitment tool. Fighters are motivated by the spoils of criminal operations, sustaining manpower even against ISWAP pressure.

The role of Lake Chad-based leader Bakura Doro in supplying weapons to JAS wings and coordinating group activities has been key to JAS’ revival, according to local sources. Niger announced it had killed Doro in a mid-August airstrike, but no evidence was provided, and according to multiple ISS sources, he is still alive.

The escalation of kidnappings, including of internally displaced persons, could roll back humanitarian gains such as resettling those who are displaced and providing access to aid workers and relief materials.

JAS’s targeting of humanitarian organisations includes an 8 August attack in which a rocket-propelled grenade fired from the Mandara Mountains killed three children close to Malteser International’s office in Gwoza, Borno State. On 1 June, JAS ambushed a non-governmental organisation convoy, despite the usual military escort, along the Gwoza-Limankara Road, killing an employee and abducting another.

The revival of JAS requires urgent policy adjustments from Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger. First, security strategies must be rebalanced to treat JAS as an independent, adaptive threat, rather than merely ISWAP’s weakened rival. That requires disrupting JAS’ logistical operations and monitoring its networks (including those outside Lake Chad), which contribute to its financing.

Second, amphibious capabilities must be strengthened to counter the group in the lake areas where it is strong. Aerial-ground coordination must also be sustained and expanded beyond ISWAP threats.

Third, governments should strengthen the region’s disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programmes to discourage deserters from rejoining JAS. Post-release monitoring must be improved, and economic support enhanced to reduce the lure of re-engagement.

Finally, the predatory economy that violent extremists exploit must be disrupted. Intelligence-led operations and targeted raids, coupled with efforts to shrink the profitability of robbery and kidnapping, are vital. Without this, JAS will continue to gain fighters and finance its resurgence.

Adamawa confirms eight deaths from suspected Buruli ulcer outbreak,"The Adamawa State government has confirmed the death of eight persons following a suspected Buruli ulcer outbreak in Malabu community, Fufore Local Government Area of the State.

The state Commissioner for Health, Felix Tangwami, disclosed this to journalists on Tuesday in Yola.

Mr Tangwami said the government is deeply concerned, noting that some victims are currently receiving treatment at the Modibbo Adama University Teaching Hospital, Yola.

He revealed that samples have already been collected and dispatched to the National Reference Laboratory for further testing.

According to him, health officials have placed the community under close monitoring to prevent further spread of the suspected disease.

The commissioner assured that the state, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, the WHO, and partners, is taking proactive steps to contain the situation.

“Our medical team is working around the clock to stabilise the victims’ condition,” he said.

He added that ongoing measures to contain the spread include the deployment of emergency response teams, awareness campaigns, and the provision of medical supplies to the affected community.

Mr Tangwami appealed to residents to remain calm, avoid panic, and maintain good hygiene practices.

He also advised them to report suspicious cases to health facilities and avoid patronising traditional remedies to prevent worsening infections.

About Buruli Ulcer

It is a rare bacterial infection of the skin and soft tissue, caused by an infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans.

It’s mainly found in tropical areas, including West Africa and Australia.

UN condemns killing of over 50 civilians in Borno attack,"The United Nations has condemned the killing of scores of civilians in an attack by Boko Haram insurgents on Darajamal village in Bama Local Government Area of Borno State.

In a statement on Sunday, the UN’s Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Mohamed Fall, described the incident as “deeply appalling and saddening,” stressing that civilians should never be targets in conflict.

PREMIUM TIMES reported that more than 50 people were killed when the insurgents stormed the community on Friday evening.

An unknown number of residents were also abducted, while others sustained injuries and fled the area. At least 28 houses were reportedly set ablaze during the raid.

“I call on security authorities to apprehend the perpetrators of this heinous attack and swiftly bring them to justice. I also call for the immediate release of all those abducted,” Mr Fall said, while extending condolences to the victims’ families, the people of Borno State and the Nigerian government.

The incident was one of the deadly attacks by Boko Haram and its splinter group, the Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP).

Both groups have orchestrated many attacks this year, targeting civilians, security forces and public infrastructure.

The insurgency in the North-east has lingered for nearly two decades, with millions displaced and others killed, especially in areas that experts describe as BAY (Borno, Adamawa and Yobe) states.

Mr Fall reiterated the UN’s call on parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian and human rights law, protect civilians, and safeguard their property.

He further affirmed the UN’s commitment to supporting people affected by the conflict and complementing government response efforts.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/819439-un-condemns-killing-of-over-50-civilians-in-borno-attack.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"Boko Haram terrorists ‘kill 66, lose 30 fighters’ in Borno twin attacks","Boko Haram terrorists have reportedly killed 66 people in two attacks in the Bama and Monguno areas of Borno State.

Local media outlets reported that the first attack occurred Friday night in Darul Jamal, a village in Bama, where 61 men and three women, who had recently been resettled from the Government Science Secondary School IDPs camp in Bama, were massacred.

Those killed include seven identified as drivers and six as labourers from Maiduguri.

The terrorists reportedly burnt down 20 houses and 10 buses as residents fled to safer areas.

The latest attack has been described as recording the highest fatalities in the Bama Local Government Area since the insurgents took over its headquarters more than 10 years ago.

Speaking with journalists in Maiduguri on Saturday, Zainab Gimba, the member the House of Representatives for the region, condemned the attack and called on the federal government to improve security in the area.

Military says it killed more than 30 attackers

Meanwhile, the military said Nigerian Air Force jets and ground troops struck back in a joint operation at Darul Jamal, killing more than 30 insurgents, according to Ehimen Ejodame, NAF spokesperson.

“In a series of three precise and successive strikes, the fleeing terrorists were decisively engaged, resulting in the neutralisation of over 30 insurgents,” Mr Ejodame, an air commodore , said in a statement on Saturday.

He added that reinforcements later secured the town and stabilised the situation.

Meanwhile, the insurgents also killed two immigration officers on Thursday in the Mungono Local Government Area.

The Insurgents reportedly invaded the town at midnight, targeting the immigration office.

These incidentss were less than seven days after the Insurgents killed seven people in Gwoza and Nigerian Army reported several killing of the Insurgents in different operations across the state.

Darul Jamal was among the latest communities resettled by the Borno State government after years of displacement caused by Boko Haram’s occupation of Bama, one of the hardest-hit areas during the insurgency.

No kidnap ransom recovered from my palace – Kwara traditional ruler,"The traditional ruler of a banditry-ravaged town in Ifelodun Local Government Area of Kwara State has denied that he was arrested for colluding with the bandits.

A video that trended for weeks on social media in the state alleged the traditional ruler of Babanla, Oba Adegboyega Alabi, was arrested after a huge sum of money suspected to be proceeds of kidnapping was found in his palace and bank accounts.

Addressing a press conference in Ilorin on Wednesday, Mr Alabi denied being quizzed or arrested by law enforcement.

However, Mr Alabi acknowledged that some people were arrested over suspected proceeds of kidnapping traced to them.

He attributed the rumour of his palace’s involvement to enemies out to sow seeds of discord among his people.

“In respect of the insecurity in our community, some people have been picked up and taken to Abuja for their alleged involvement of having huge amount of money.

“And many people have heard the state Commissioner of Police saying nothing was found in my palace. The same thing for Oba of Alabe. There was nothing found in his palace.

“So, no traditional ruler is in the net of the security agencies. I believe that the people spreading the rumour are the enemies of the community. But I’m telling you that they have not found any amount of money in my house,” the traditional ruler said.

Military base

Mr Alabi urged the Nigerian government to establish a military base in the area because of a forest that stretches to Edu, Patigi, Oke-Ero local government areas in Kwara and Kogi State.

He said the forest has become a haven for bandits, arguing that military presence in the area would check their activities in the forest.

The traditional ruler said the intervention of armed personnel had restored relative peace in Babanla but maintained that addressing the issue permanently would require the forest to be combed.

Mr Alabi said the Babanla community is ready to donate the forest to the government to enhance security in the area and create employment opportunities for the people.

“I have consulted all the necessary security agencies and they are working very hard on the security situation in our town. When you go to Babanla, people now sleep peacefully.

“It is not only in Babanla that we are experiencing kidnapping. People are talking about Babanla because we have the large forest where kidnappers and bandits are hiding. It is a very large land that extends to Edu, Patigi, Oke-Ero and Kogi State.

“When the Army GOC came, I told him that the solution is for them to comb the largest forest so that these criminals will leave that place for us. I told the GOC that we want them to place an army base very close to that forest so that we won’t have problem again about the invaders.

“When the governor came and asked that if this forest is cleared, are we ready to give it to the government, I said yes. We are ready to give it to the government so that any investor can make use of the forest.”

Recalling the last attacks on the community, the traditional ruler said the bandits stole about 20 motorcycles and looted businesses.

Mr Alabi said the bandits’ activities forced people to abandon their farms and businesses.

However, said peace has been restored in the community with residents going about their normal activities.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/820455-no-kidnap-ransom-recovered-from-my-palace-kwara-traditional-ruler.html,https://premiumtimesng.com

Court remands pastor for alleged rape,"A magistrate’s court in Makurdi, Benue State, on Wednesday, ordered the remand of a 34-year-old pastor, Kelvin Imo, at the Correctional Centre, Makurdi for allegedly raping a church member.

Mr Imo, who resides at No. 5, Gboko Road, Makurdi, was charged with rape.

However, the chief magistrate, Kevin Mbanongun, did not take his plea for lack of jurisdiction over the matter.

Mr Mbanongun adjourned the matter until 8 October for further mention.

Earlier, the prosecutor, Friday Kanshio, who is an inspector of police, told the court that the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Makurdi, received a petition written by the victim against the pastor on 2 September.

How it happened

Mr Kanshio said the complainant stated in the petition that she went to a Living Faith Church branch, opposite Coca-cola Camp, Km 5 Gboko Road, Makurdi, on 22 April to see the accused, who was her pastor, for prayer and counselling.

According to the prosecutor, the victim reported that after praying for her, the pastor used a handkerchief to wipe her face and she lost strength as a result.

INTERVIEW: What Nigerians should expect at NIM conference and after – Registrar,"The Nigerian Institute of Management (Chartered), NIM, is preparing for its annual conference, expected to be the largest gathering of management professionals in Africa. Established in 1961, NIM is Nigeria’s oldest management professional institute with over 200,000 individual members and more than 400 corporate members nationwide.

PREMIUM TIMES’ Kabir Yusuf sat down with the Registrar of the institute, Taiwo Ganiyat Olusesi, to discuss the institute’s plan to make all members AI-certified by 2026, its focus on youth leadership, and why senior citizens remain central to Nigeria’s management future.

Excerpt:

PT: Let me start by asking about this year’s conference. What is the theme of this year’s conference, and what should participants expect?

Olusesi: This is our 64th annual conference and Annual General Meeting. It runs over three days, beginning with a welcome cocktail and registration on 7 September. The opening ceremony and a panel session will be held on 8 September, followed by our gala night. On 9 September, we will hold another panel session, breakout discussions, a presentation of the communiqué, and then the AGM.

We expect at least 3,000 participants this year. Our breakout sessions are tailored to different groups: youth, mid-level managers, and senior managers.

The theme is “Leveraging Emerging Technologies to Drive Innovation, Creativity and Productivity.” For youth, we are focusing on preparing them for leadership roles, particularly given the leadership gaps caused by migration in recent years. For senior managers, we are addressing ageing and post-retirement care.

PT: How do you plan to address the leadership gap among youth?

Olusesi: We will engage and encourage young people to take up leadership roles. We are also focusing on technology and artificial intelligence, which is the future of management.

Our keynote speaker is Deacon Mike Egboh, Country Director of Chemonics GHSE-PSM Project Nigeria. The theme speaker is Mohammed Santuraki, Pro-Chancellor of the Federal University of Technology, Minna.

Other panellists include former Speaker of the Ekiti State House of Assembly, Olubunmi Adelugba; NECO Registrar, Professor Dantani Wushishi; UK Department for Business and Trade’s Dr Simeon Umukoro; and Professor Nnamdi Nwaodu, an ageing expert and founder of the African Elder Ageing and Wellness Initiative.

On technology, Omolara Onua of Unicorn Institute of Technology will moderate the AI panel. We will also feature Dr Tope Fasua, Special Adviser to the President on Economic Matters.

In addition to the academic sessions, we will hold our AGM, the Celebrating Management Excellence gala night, where awards and honorary fellowships will be conferred, and finally issue a communiqué to guide stakeholders.

PT: You mentioned technology as central to this year’s theme. Is the Institute trying to encourage innovation and creativity among management professionals?

Olusesi: Yes. The world has gone digital, and to remain relevant, managers must be tech-savvy.

PT: Which emerging technologies are you most keen on in transforming management in Nigeria?

Olusesi: Artificial intelligence tops the list. We are reviewing our syllabus to include responsible AI, and we will run refresher courses so that, within the next two to three years, every NIM member is AI-certified. That way, even as an old institute, we remain contemporary.

PT: What unique perspectives will the panellists bring?

Olusesi: We ensured diversity: youth, middle-aged, and senior professionals; people from both public and private sectors; and international voices. This mix will enrich the discussions. For instance, Dr Fasua will bring government perspectives for the youth, while Unicorn Institute will showcase innovations in AI. Professor Nwaodu will provide insights on ageing, which is relevant for our retired members.

PT: Why spotlight senior citizens at the conference?

Olusesi: We want to ensure that our older population remains relevant. Retirement should not mean the end of knowledge-sharing. We will also explore how we can partner with government initiatives for senior citizens.

PT: How is NIM nurturing future leaders among Nigeria’s youth?

Olusesi: We run the Young Managers Competition and Summit. Winners from six zones converge to pitch ideas, and the finalists serve as ambassadors of the institute for a year. Last year, we added the summit component, bringing together employers, innovators, and funders to chart a way forward.

Importantly, no NIM staff above 40 sits on the planning committee of this programme—it is led entirely by young managers. We only provide guidance and funding.

We also run the Catch Them Young programme in universities and polytechnics so that students graduate with NIM certification. We maintain strong links with the NYSC, though participation has reduced due to insecurity and economic challenges.

PT: How are conference outcomes followed up with the government and industry?

Olusesi: Our institute has faculties across sectors—governance, health, academia, technology—and each takes responsibility for follow-up on specific communiqué items. We also publish the outcomes in newspapers, send copies to MDs and stakeholders, and use our networks to push implementation. Even achieving 50 per cent of the communiqué is progress.

PT: What legacy do you hope this year’s conference will leave?

Olusesi: First, technological advancement. From 2026, every NIM professional manager will be technologically certified. Second, recognition for senior citizens—their wisdom is invaluable. Third, youth engagement. We will push for stronger collaboration with the government on empowerment and capacity-building.

PT: What are you personally most looking forward to?

Olusesi: Participation and satisfaction. We want delegates to have a rewarding experience and look forward to future NIM programmes. Beyond the conference, we have Management Day on 19 November, the Young Managers Summit, and several local and international trainings lined up.

PT: Since becoming Registrar, which innovation are you most proud of?

Olusesi: Staff motivation has improved greatly, and our financial performance has grown. But most importantly, we launched the NIM membership app, which I hope will one day be a benchmark for other professional bodies.

PT: Thank you.

Olusesi: Thank you.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/818982-interview-what-nigerians-should-expect-at-nim-conference-and-after-registrar.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"My reforms working, Nigeria now respected globally – Tinubu","President Bola Tinubu declared on Tuesday that his administration’s bold economic reforms, which aim to restore Nigeria to its enviable position, are achieving favourable results.

The president said that the country’s economy is now stable and attracting interest from around the world.

He stated this at the State House when he received His Imperial Majesty, Oba Ghandi Afolabi Oladunni Olaoye, Orumogege III, the Soun of Ogbomosoland, in audience with some other royal fathers.

President Tinubu said, “Years of neglect and self-deception, fake records, smuggling, and all of that denied Nigeria the necessary revenue for progress and development.

“Then we were confronted again with arbitrage trading of currency, an illusion of selling papers, corruption all over the place, and the integrity of the country and its economy being extremely and adversely challenged.

“We had to take those actions. With your prayers, patience, perseverance and great understanding, I’m glad to tell you today that the economy is stabilised. The bleeding has stopped. Haemorrhage is gone; the patient is alive.”

The president also said the establishment of NELFUND was to ensure that no student would drop out because of poverty.

He affirmed that everybody has a right to education as it is the “greatest weapon you can give to human beings against poverty; that’s what we are doing. We have remained aggressive on our infrastructure. And it’s just two years.”

President Tinubu thanked the Soun of Ogbomoso for crediting his administration with the bold decisions taken immediately upon resumption of office.

He noted that the people of Ogbomosoland were already feeling the modernisation and transformation introduced by the monarch, who promised to strengthen traditional institutions.

The president promised to engage the Ministers of Power, Water Resources, Agriculture, and Works to look into the visiting monarch’s requests, stating they can make Nigeria self-sufficient in agriculture.

The Soun commended the president for his incredible strides, which “only a bold leader could have recorded. Removing fuel subsidy has shown us that it is the right decision, and we can see the effects.”

He said the foreign exchange reforms and introduction of NELFUND have made it easier for many students to continue their schooling without considering dropping out.

He also commended the president for awarding the contract for dualization of the Oyo-Ogbomosho Road, which had been abandoned for decades, pointing out that the road would spur economic activities as a significant gateway to the North.

The paramount ruler, however, requested the president’s intervention in the water and power supply in Ogbomoso, the upgrading of the General Hospital in the town into a Federal Medical Centre, as well as the establishment of a research institute to enhance the development and transformation of the famous ‘Ogbomoso mangoes and cashew nuts’ into a viable agricultural enterprise.

Oba Olaoye thanked the president for appointing Ogbomoso sons to his administration, notably the Federal Inland Revenue Service Chairman, Zacch Adedeji, and the DG of the Bureau of Public Procurement, Debo Adedokun.

On the entourage of the Soun of Ogbomosoland were five other Kings representing the five councils in Ogbomosoland, namely High Chief Samuel Otolorin, the Areago of Ogbomosoland; HRM, Oba Oyetunji Adeyeye, the Alajaawa of Ajaawa; HRM Oba Bolarinwa Ezekiel Olajide, the Onisapa of Isapa; HRM Oba Babatunde Amao, the Aale Oke-elerin, and HRM Oba Prof. Akinola John Akintola, the Olokin-apa of Okin-apa.

Others were Ogundare Rebecca, Iyalode of Ogbomosoland; Sola Adepoju, former DG Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria; Tunji Olaniyi, a businessman, and AbdulGaniyu Owodunni, the Aare Musulumi of Ogbomosoland.

Also present was the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Public Communication, Sunday Dare, a prominent ‘son of the soil’ who doubles as the Agbaakin of Ogbomosoland.

Insecurity: Tinubu directs immediate review of security operations in Katsina,"President Bola Tinubu, on Tuesday in Abuja, said the armed forces will deploy more advanced military hardware and surveillance gadgets in Katsina State to halt the recent spate of attacks on innocent citizens by bandits.

The President, who received a delegation of eminent citizens of the state led by Governor Dikko Radda at the State House, said the federal government will consider the operations of a state police, and further equip recently deployed forest guards.

President Tinubu, who decried the politicisation of proposed state police, said the exigencies of security in some states will require the deployment of outfits that understand the terrain and the peculiar culture of the people and can easily network at the grassroots.

“The security challenges that we are facing are surmountable. Yes, we have porous borders. We inherited weaknesses that could have been addressed earlier. It is a challenge that we must fix, and we are facing it.

“I have today directed all the security agencies to energise further and look at the strategies. We have approved the additional acquisition of drones,” he added.

The President also directed daily feedback on the operations in Katsina.

“I am reviewing all the aspects of security; I have to create a state police. We are looking at that holistically. We will defeat insecurity. We must protect our children, people, livelihood, places of worship, and recreational spaces. They can’t intimidate us,” the president added.

The president assured the eminent leaders that former President Muhammadu Buhari would be immortalised to capture his legacy for posterity.

“The time we lost our brother, President Buhari, is a loss for all of us. It is the will of God Almighty, but he has left in a good way. He didn’t hand over a defeated country, a battered political structure, but a legacy of success, which is the most important thing.

“We just have to continue praying that Almighty Allah should grant him Aljannah Firdausi and give the rest of us the ability to stand very strong and push Nigeria forward. Not to look back in sorrow but move forward with success.

“It would have been regretful if we had lost the elections to the other parties. There are no other wishes he would have had than to have Katsina State and the Presidency intact,” the president noted.

The Governor of Katsina State thanked the President for his continual support for the state, which includes the appointment of indigenes into strategic positions in the state and the provision of infrastructure.

“Mr President, I would like to thank you very much, and I want to say before our elders that I never came to the President with a request that he rejected.

“We thank you, Mr President, for sharing with Katsina. You are a true son of Katsina State. I recall that Katsina was the first state you visited and spent a night in. We thank you for the privilege.

“We are here again, Mr President, I know that you are aware of the problem affecting our state,” he said.

Mr Radda said the state needs more support in security, youth empowerment, and infrastructure.

The former Governor of Katsina State, Aminu Masari, thanked the President for honouring the late President Muhammadu with a “true state funeral.”

Mr Masari assured the President of the loyalty of the state.

The Waziri of Katsina, Ibrahim Ida, commended President Tinubu`s efforts to ensure the timely completion of the Kano-Maradi Rail project and other infrastructures in the state.

Mr Ida said the Umaru Musa Yar’Adua International Airport needed an upgrade to optimise its usage.

He said the state would need more security attention from the federal government, particularly in the Southern part of Katsina.

The Waziri of Kastina also thanked the President for honouring the former President with a state burial.

"INTERVIEW: Why arrest, trial of Simon Ekpa delayed — Finnish Ambassador","The Finland Ambassador to Nigeria, Sanna Selin, recently sat down with PREMIUM TIMES to discuss bilateral relations, ongoing collaborations in trade and investment, education, energy and opportunities for deeper cooperation between both countries.

She also spoke about controversial Biafra activist Simon Ekpa, who is facing a terrorism trial in Finland. Mr Ekpa was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison by a Finnish court on Monday. The interview with the ambassador was held several days before the court judgment.

Here is an excerpt of the interview

PT: The Finnish education system is globally admired, and Nigeria has benefited little from it beyond individual scholarships. Is there a partnership to support systemic reform, funding gaps, curriculum development, or teacher training in Nigeria using Finnish expertise?

Ms Selin: Yes, the achievement of the Finnish education system has been known all over the world, and Finland is a sought-after partner for Nigeria when thinking about developing the education sector. You mentioned scholarships, which is true. Cooperation between both countries is already on through scholarships. However, we are supporting Nigeria with systemic reforms through our comprehensive teachers’ training programme. For example, we have a group of teachers from Lagos who participated in service training in Finland. One thing to mention is the education outside the classroom model, which starts very early, before the child is enrolled in a school or skills are learned outside of the classroom. This is something that has proven to be very important.

Also, there is the Finland-Nigeria cooperation in the field of education. We are training education institutions, funding partnerships with Finnish universities, such as universities of applied sciences, and finding partners for them in Nigeria.

PT: Despite cordial diplomatic relations between Nigeria and Finland, trade volumes between the two countries remain modest. Are there ongoing discussions in recent years aimed at strengthening trade relations?

Ms Selin: You are very much right. Trade relations have been low, even though we have always had good relations with Nigeria. This is because we are not importing oil and gas from Nigeria. But there is a reason for that as well, we are trying to diversify our economy to renewable energy and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.

Recently, we have had diplomatic visits from Nigeria to Finland and otherwise. This cooperation is going on, and we are exploring more all the time.

We also have the Nordic-Nigeria Connect. A business platform that has already been held three times before, and it is happening again. This time in Lagos in October. It will be connecting hundreds of Finnish and Nigerian companies, particularly those in the field of green economy, digital services and the health sector. We are planning to bring in a business delegation. The other Nordic countries with whom we are partnering will also be doing the same. Norway, Sweden and Denmark are the countries we are partnering with. We are exploring all the possibilities for the trade, and hopefully, in the coming year, we will see some better figures.

The current Nigerian administration has made attracting foreign investment a central focus, with several policies over the past two years geared toward this goal. From your perspective, do you see these efforts as potentially stimulating Finnish private sector investment in Nigeria’s emerging sectors, such as the digital economy, renewable energy, and the creative economy?

Ms Selin: We see the investment-friendly policies that have been offered here in Nigeria. Of course, it is a positive driver for Finnish companies and our private sector. We have four priorities here in Nigeria. We have ICT, energy and power, a secular economy and health. We see in the government programme that Nigeria is trying to find new solutions and partnerships, and its technology sectors demand reforms. Finland is an innovation-driven, high-tech society and sees that Nigeria is promising in this context when it comes to renewable energy. Nigeria’s energy cap provides some opportunity for Finnish innovations, for example, in clean energy solutions. I already mentioned that we are trying to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and diversify our economy. We can see that Nigeria is also trying to do the same, and we would be happy to partner with Nigeria in this transition that has started.

Another thing that is also very interesting here is the creative economy that Nigeria is developing. There is a growing potential for collaboration. For example, when it comes to gaming, animation and digital media.

PT: With our investment-friendly policies, are there any signs that we could be attracting Finnish private sector investment to Nigeria?

Ms Selin: In the long run, yes. As we discussed, the interaction between our countries has been quite small. The first step, of course, is to increase the awareness of Nigeria in Finland and also the other way around. When people contact increases and Finnish companies get more familiar with Nigeria, investments will follow.

Investments are not the first step, but I am confident that in a certain period, the investments will also come.

PT: How would you assess Nigeria’s place in Finland’s foreign policy priorities on the African continent, especially compared to East Africa or Southern African partners?

Ms Selin: We published 2021 our Africa strategy. The strategy aims at diversifying our partnerships and relations to find more mutually beneficial partnerships and also to develop a more ambitious agenda with the African countries. So it’s more trade, less aid. And this I have heard also from many decision makers here in Nigeria. There’s a call for more trade, not aid. Of course, assistance is also important, but trade is something that Finland is looking into with Nigeria.

When it comes to countries like Eastern African countries, we have had very long cooperation in the development agenda in the old days. But we have shifted very much from that. As I said, trade is now the thing, and we see Nigeria as a potential partner, both in the political scene and as a regional power, a big country in sub-Saharan Africa, and home of the ECOWAS. We see Nigeria as an important player here. So it’s very, very important to have a closer partnership with the giant of Africa, which is Nigeria.

PT: The trade innovation you’ve spoken of, does it include knowledge transfer to Nigerians, capacity development in those areas?

Ms Selin: Knowledge transfer is an important part of what we do. This reflects in technology transfer. This is also in the field of education; for example, Finland has been a strong player in training the trainers. We must see how we can also participate in job creation, knowledge transfer here. Currently, we have a lot of Nigerian students who are studying in Finland, and I hope that when they finish their studies, they will come back to Nigeria and use their learned skills to develop the country further.

PT: How easy is it for Nigerians to get an education in Finland?

Ms Selin: There is a lot of potential here, there are a lot of skilful young people here, and it’s basically just taking the exam, applying to the schools. Many Nigerians have been very successful in the application processes. We have more and more English-speaking programmes also in Finland.

Earlier, everything was in Finnish, but nowadays we have more and more English-speaking programmes.

PT: Nigeria and Finland have maintained cordial relations since the 1960s. However, the relationship faced strains in recent years, particularly at the height of the Biafra agitation, when Nigeria pushed for the repatriation of Simon Ekpa to face terrorism-related charges. At the time, many Nigerians believed the Finnish government, and perhaps the EU, was reluctant to act. Although Ekpa has now been arrested, some argue that this only happened due to sustained Nigerian pressure. Can you share with us what really happened? Was the Finnish government forced to take that action?

Ms Selin: Let me start on a little bit wider scale. Finland, of course, has a strong interest in promoting security, peace and stability in Nigeria. Also, Finland is internationally known as an advocate for mediation and as a mediation actor. We support grassroots actors and promote dialogue between the parties. And in recent years, Finland has also become an active supporter of peace mediation here in Nigeria. For example, we have been supporting the work of the traditional and religious leaders in peace mediation and peacemaking because we see that building sustainable peace demands inclusive societies based on human rights and the involvement of all members. We also have a special focus on women and the youth because they are an essential part of society building.

Now, to your question on the case of Simon Ekpa. It has attracted quite a lot of attention in recent months and years here in Nigeria. But the case is not over yet.

I’ll shortly say this. We have had extremely good cooperation with the Nigerian authorities. However, cases like this take a long time to investigate. It takes time to gather all the necessary evidence.

Currently, we are waiting for the district court decision in the Simon Ekba case on September 1. We will soon hear what the court has decided. Until then, it’s better not to speculate too much. We will see what will happen. But be assured that the case has been very well investigated. In countries like Finland, where the rule of law and human rights are very strong on the agenda, things are done properly. Sometimes, that takes a lot of time. It’s very interesting.

PT: While Finland has made remarkable progress in advancing gender equality and inclusivity, these remain pressing challenges in Nigeria. What lessons can Nigeria draw from Finland’s experience?

Ms Selin: We see gender equality, not just a moral imperative, but essential to national stability and sustainable development. Women are half of the population, more or less, and Finland’s success story in this area is a result of the long-term commitment that we have put into inclusive education, health care and political participation of women in the society building. Yes, our countries are very different, but it’s always good to share the best practices, and then Nigeria can find its model. There are universal values and international agreements on this. So, what Nigeria can learn from Finland is to strengthen the legal framework related to women and increase women’s representation in leadership, both economically and politically. I know that there is a new law about increasing the seats in the House of Representatives here. That’s something interesting we are following. There’s also a need to ensure equal access to health care, education and economic opportunities.

Finland stands ready to support Nigeria through the knowledge exchange and policy dialogue, and partnerships. So, I look forward to working on this agenda, not only the trade agenda, which I mentioned earlier.

PT: Nokia was once a major brand in Nigeria in the early 2000s, dominating the country’s telecommunications market. Over time, however, this influence declined. Why did this shift occur?

Ms Selin: We have approximately 25 Finnish companies in Nigeria. It’s not a huge number, but we are also quite a small country of 5.6 million people. Nokia has been present in this country for a long time, decades, and they’re based in Lagos. They employ about 100 people over there. It used to be well known for its mobile phones, but it sold its mobile phone business more than 10 years ago. They are more concentrated on telecommunications and networks — 5G, 6G, and even 7G development research work. Nokia can be a very important partner for Nigeria. We have also been talking about border security issues, and I think Nokia has the right type of technology. They also have many other telecommunication connectivity issues as they have expanded their expertise over the last years.

There is another big Finnish company present here. It’s called Wärtsilä. They are also based in Lagos, like many companies with offices in Nigeria. They are helping with energy transition and green future solutions, and they employ around 100 or 200 people. They have been here for a really long time and are here to stay.

I hope more Finnish companies find their way here, following these two global giants.

PT: In Nigeria, there is still a challenge of access to power, and power is the backbone of technology. Is the country’s energy challenge taken into consideration in the digital and technological innovations you are partnering with Nigeria on, or is it a separate agenda?

Ms Selin: Nigeria is diversifying its economy from an oil-based economy. It is using gas as a source of power, and that is something within Finnish expertise.

And for renewables, we are talking about hydro or solar or any other more renewable energy sources; we have the technology. So, if there is an interest in this, we are happy to share more information and map out the possibilities for the country.

PT: You’ve spoken about technology, energy, education and more. In your view, what untapped diplomatic or economic opportunities exist between our two countries, and what barriers have hindered cooperation?

Ms Selin: Again, the first thing is to increase awareness. We need to know and understand each other better. We are far away geographically, and the interaction hasn’t been that big. It takes a little bit of time for Finnish companies to understand the kind of potential Nigeria can offer for them. Of course, my job as an ambassador is to bring forward this awareness.

Also, natural interaction and interest will follow when people get to know each other better. I’m very happy to bring forward the bilateral agenda between our countries and whatever we can do and find new partnerships. A few sectors were already mentioned earlier, and I’m not excluding any other industry outside of the possible cooperation.

PT: You did say earlier that one of the top priorities for Finland in its relations with Nigeria is the health sector. Could you speak more on this?

Ms Selin: We are mapping a new area, and one thing we find interesting is the demand for quality healthcare. There are many cases of Nigerians travelling abroad for healthcare. In Finland, we created something called the Centres of Excellence for the health sector. They are normally in the university or university hospitals, or public hospitals. They are, sometimes, private hospitals as well.

We are considering developing this kind of Centres of Excellence in Nigeria. Hopefully, this will encourage both Nigerian doctors and patients to stay back in Nigeria, while also attracting patients from the neighbouring countries who are in need of healthcare services. And of course, this involves a lot of different kinds of technologies, equipment and so on.

This is something that we are mapping out at the moment in the healthcare sector. We are involving technology. This is not just basic healthcare, but it is also a technology transfer.

PT: Can you tell us about the Nordic-Nigeria Connect event taking place later this year?

Ms Selin: I forgot to mention earlier that we had a very historic visit last August. Four Nordic foreign ministers visited Nigeria. This was a very historic thing because they have never done something like this anywhere else in the world, though we are considering doing more of that. The Nordic-Nigeria connect event I mentioned earlier is happening in October. This is the fourth time we are hosting the event. These themes are about the green transition, sustainability, digitalisation, and also health. At the moment, we are looking for cooperation partners and sponsors. We are also trying to attract high-level delegations from our Nordic countries.

PT: What does Nigeria or Nigerians stand to gain from the conference?

Ms Selin: It will bring together Nigerian companies and companies from the Nordic countries. So, more partnerships, more trade, more business opportunities. That is the idea behind it.

The goal is to find new partnerships and strengthen the ones that are already in existence. Very often, we ask government officials to increase trade, but, in the end, it is up to the companies. They go where they want to go. To the markets they find interesting. And the final decision is, of course, with the companies themselves.

There is so much Nigeria can offer the Nordic countries, especially when we think about how innovative, startup-driven, for example, Lagos state is, not to exclude the other states here. We need to find a model for how to bring these things forward in the future.

PT: Finland has a strong taxation system and has in the past supported other African countries, particularly Kenya, in broadening their tax base. Nigeria is currently making similar efforts. Is Finland providing Nigeria with comparable support to raise revenue through taxation and implement investment-friendly policies?

Ms Selin: You’re very much right about the heavy taxation we have in Finland. I’m paying about 40 per cent of my salary as taxes. It is at the base of what we have in Finland nowadays. From healthcare, education, and social services. Sectors that are now very, very much developed. They are created because the Finnish taxpayers have been actively paying taxes.

With the new tax reforms, the tax base in Nigeria could also increase because they would then, I assume, go directly to developing the country as we have done in Finland.

You mentioned Kenya. We don’t have with Nigeria any similar type of cooperation, but it’s definitely something that we should look into if there is an interest from the Nigerian side.

PT: Finland has positioned itself as a global leader in environmental innovation. In Africa, climate change has intensified, with countries like Nigeria facing severe flooding, droughts, and heatwaves. Are there specific climate-focused partnerships between Finland and Nigeria, perhaps in areas like adaptation or renewable energy, that both governments are currently pursuing?

Ms Selin: Well, we have had discussions with the Nigerian government on how we could help or contribute or partner in key climate initiatives.

We are exploring support for off-grid renewable energy. We discussed earlier that the energy gap in Nigeria is still wide. And this, alongside insecurity, has been hindering the investments. Currently, we have some joint research on the circular economy, waste management side, and climate resilience.

Also, we have some really good Finnish technology for these types of things. We tend to think from the business side and how we could increase trade in these sectors. We are also looking into having deeper collaboration on Nigeria’s energy transition, as we discussed, and aligning with our commitment to sustainable development.

Here again, we are happy to share our expertise and what we have done, although our climate conditions are very different. Finland has very harsh, long, dark winters.

PT: You’ve spent almost a year in Nigeria now. What memorable Nigerian dishes have you tried, and have you also had the chance to experience some of our traditional clothing?

Ms Selin: Rightly so. I have been here since September last year. It has been a very intensive year, learning a lot of new things, getting to know this huge country with so many different cultures and traditions, and a big population. It’s very interesting.

I am really honoured, very pleased that my government has sent me here. I can achieve a lot of things when I get to know the country better. That’s why it’s very important to continue the dialogue with a lot of different players and see that there are other partnership possibilities.

I love Adires, as you can see. So I have a collection of Nigerian clothing already, and I’m planning to get some more. I, of course, have developed an ear for the Nigerian Afrobeat. I love Afrobeat music as well.

I’m still trying to get used to the very spicy food here. In Finland, the food is not very spicy, so it takes a bit longer to adjust. Also, the people are very nice here, very friendly, and cooperative.

All in all, it has been a very, very good first year.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/817980-interview-why-arrest-trial-of-simon-ekpa-delayed-finnish-ambassador.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Africa imports close to $50 billion worth of food annually- official,"The Director General of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Simeon Ehui, on Sunday, has said Africa imports close to $50 billion worth of food annually.

Mr Ehui disclosed this in an interview with journalists at the ongoing Africa Food System Forum (#AFSForum2025), in Dakar, Senegal on Sunday.

“Today, Africa imports close to 50 billion US dollars in food. This is unacceptable. We need to be able to use science to alleviate the problem of food insecurity,” Mr Ehui said.

The staggering figure, according to him, underscores the importance of food sovereignty.

Food sovereignty is the right of communities, countries, or regions to control their own food systems, encompassing production, distribution, and consumption. This promotes sustainable agriculture, supports small-scale farmers, and enhances food security while also protecting the environment and advancing social justice.

Speaking on Sunday, Mr Ehui emphasised the importance of science-driven solutions to address food insecurity in Africa, noting that research and development are critical to transforming the continent’s food system and improving the livelihoods of farmers.

However, he stressed that research outputs must be translated into actionable solutions that reach end-users, particularly smallholder farmers.

“I want to say that the problem of food insecurity in Africa must be resolved through the use of science. And science is through the research that we do, which is quite critical.

“Now, if we develop scientific results, and then they are not in the hands of the end users, then science becomes irrelevant. So, what this means is that we need support of rural infrastructure, investment in the rural areas, promote the extension of the technologies to the end users, build partnerships so that the farmers can use the latest technologies to change their livelihoods. We need to move from research, delivery, and scaling up by the farmers,” he said.

He further emphasised that the continent’s food import bill is not only a strain on its economies but also a missed opportunity for economic growth and job creation.

By relying on imports, he said, Africa is essentially exporting employment opportunities that could be created locally.

To address this challenge, Mr Ehui called for significant investment in food and agriculture in Africa.

“Food sovereignty is critically important. Like I told you earlier, we import close to 50 billion US dollars of food. It means that we are exporting, if you want, employment elsewhere in the countries from which we are importing the food from. So, we need to invest significantly in food and agriculture in Africa in order to stop the importation of this food.

“So, investment in research and education is important. That’s why the comprehensive African agricultural development program is pushing for a 10 per cent investment in budget from countries into agriculture sector so that we can reduce the importation of food using the scarce resources we have to import food,” he added.

Those scarce resources, he said, could be used to improve education, health among others.

“If you want, import technologies, but not to import food. And we need to build partnerships with countries that have made a difference, like in Asia, India, and Brazil, where we know that they have succeeded in transforming the food system through the application of science and technology,” he said.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/business-news/817917-africa-imports-close-to-50-billion-worth-of-food-annually-official.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"Ghana receives Nigerians, other West Africans deported from US","The Ghanaian government has received 14 US deportees from various West African countries, including Nigeria.

President John Mahama disclosed this on Wednesday while speaking to reporters, AP reports. He, however, did not disclose the exact number of Nigerians on the list.

Ghana now joins Eswatini, Rwanda, and South Sudan on the list of African countries that have received deportees from the US since President Donald Trump’s return to office.

According to Mr Mahama, Ghana agreed to receive West African deportees because the ECOWAS protocol on free movement already allows nationals from the region to enter the country without a visa.

“We agreed with (Washington) that West African nationals were acceptable because all our fellow West African nationals don’t need a visa to come to our country,” he said.

He also noted that the deportees who arrived in the country, including those of Nigerian and Gambian origin, are planning to return to their home countries.

The US government has intensified its crackdown on immigrants, with Mr Trump labelling them as criminals and targeting nationals from countries with high rates of visa overstays.

The effort is part of his controversial pledge to carry out “the largest deportation operation in American history.”

Earlier in the year, the Rwanda government struck a deal to accept 250 deportees.

“Those approved for resettlement in Rwanda will be provided with workforce training, healthcare, and accommodation support to jumpstart their lives in Rwanda,” the Rwandan government had announced.

Meanwhile, in July, the Nigerian government accused the US of pressuring it to accept Venezuelan deportees.

The government linked the 10 per cent import tariff imposed on the country by Mr Trump’s administration to its refusal to accept the deportees.

“We cannot accept Venezuelan deportees to Nigeria for crying out loud. We already have 230 million people.

“You will be the same people who would castigate us if we acquiesce to accepting Venezuelans from US prisons to be brought in,” he said.

Aside from Africa, the administration has also sent deportees to many other third-world countries such as Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba, and Yemen.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/820507-ghana-receives-nigerians-other-west-africans-deported-from-us.html,https://premiumtimesng.com

"Qatar counters US, denies being notified of Israeli attack beforehand","The Qatari government has countered the claim by the administration of US President Donald Trump that it was notified of Israel’s attack on Hamas negotiators in its capital beforehand.

According to the spokesperson for Qatar’s Foreign Minister, Majed Al Ansari, the claim made by the White House shortly after the attack that it shared intel with the Qatari government was baseless and untrue.

The attack on the Doha residential headquarters led to the death of six officials, including a Qatari security official. But no member of the Hamas leadership was affected.

The Israeli army described the strikes as an assassination attempt on top Hamas leaders in Qatar’s capital, where multiple explosions were heard.

A few hours after the attack, the White House announced that the military had notified it and that President Donald Trump, in turn, alerted the Qatari government of the impending attack.

The White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr Trump directed his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to “inform the Qataris of the attack.”

“Unilaterally bombing inside Qatar, a sovereign nation and close ally of the United States that is working very hard and bravely taking risks with us to broker peace, does not advance Israel or America’s goals.

“However, eliminating Hamas, which has profited off the misery of those living in Gaza, is a worthy goal,” she said.

Responding to this claim, Mr Al Ansari said Qatar was notified of the “impending attack” in the middle of the explosions, after the Israeli army had launched its strike.

In a post on X, he wrote, “The statements being circulated about Qatar being informed of the attack in advance are baseless.”

“The call from a US official came during the sound of explosions caused by the Israeli attack in Doha,” he said.

Qatar has suspended its mediation efforts between Israel and Hamas toward the release of Gaza hostages and a ceasefire deal.

The Middle Eastern country declared that it would not tolerate “this reckless Israeli behaviour and its continued tampering with regional security.”

“Investigations are underway at the highest level, and further details will be announced as soon as they become available,” Mr Al Ansari said.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/foreign/world-foreign/820027-qatar-counters-us-denies-being-notified-of-israeli-attack-beforehand.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Special Eagles eye World Cup success,"Some players of Nigeria’s Amputee Football National Team, the Special Eagles, say they are optimistic about their chances at the 2026 Amputee World Cup in Costa Rica.

They spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Friday, calling for more support to boost preparations ahead of the mundial.

Defender Nnanna Nwakpa, based in Lagos, said amputee football had been life-changing for him since joining five years ago.

“I’ve always loved football, both playing and watching. After my amputation, I discovered amputee football at the National Stadium in Lagos.

“At first, it was difficult, but eventually it clicked. Football became therapeutic, it helped me mentally and played a big role in my recovery,” he told NAN.

Reflecting on the 2024 Amputee Nations Cup in Egypt, where Nigeria beat Burundi 11–0, Nwakpa described it as a beautiful moment.

“We knew Egypt had already beaten Burundi 8–1, so we had to set a bigger target. The tactics clicked, and the goals kept coming,” he said.

On grassroots development, he praised the federation under President Paul Maduaku for introducing initiatives such as Kick for Love and zonal championships.

“There are more games and scouting opportunities now, and it gives young players the chance to be discovered,” he added.

Another player, Michael Joel from Imo, said passion and joy for football kept him going after losing his leg in 2018.

“It’s not about money, but the love of the game. I was playing able-bodied football before amputation, and that passion still drives me today,” he said.

Joel said balancing football with life off the pitch meant doing online work, spoken word, and poetry as side hustles.

He also expressed confidence ahead of the World Cup.

“With both home-based and foreign-based players, and the level of preparation we’ve had, I believe we’re ready to face strong European teams,” he said.

For Eze Chikenedu, a central defender, the World Cup ticket secured in Egypt is proof of the team’s readiness.

“We’re 100 percent ready because we already qualified. The main challenge now is finance, but with proper support, we will be well prepared,” he said.

Chikenedu stressed that government and private backing would make a huge difference.

“With enough support, the team can improve both on and off the pitch,” he said. He also noted the resilience of the squad.

“In every disability, there is ability. We don’t see our condition as the end. Instead, we use it as motivation to make Nigeria proud,” he said.

Head coach Gbenga Dosunmu said the team was equal to the task.

“By God’s grace, this is not the first time. We have what it takes to be there, and if well packaged, performance will be very high,” he said.

Mr Dosunmu appealed to sponsors and policymakers for more support.

“Their support will go a long way for the team, because we have a strong squad,” he added.

Meanwhile, the Special Eagles’ determination highlights amputee football’s growing role in Nigeria’s sports sector, but funding and visibility remain key to global success.

“The whole board of the NFF has to go”: Mikel seeks drastic changes if Super Eagles fail to qualify for World Cup,"Former Super Eagles captain Mikel John Obi has launched a scathing criticism of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), warning that the entire leadership should step aside if Nigeria fail to qualify for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Speaking on his ObiOne Podcast, Mikel voiced the frustration of millions of fans, describing the possibility of missing a second consecutive World Cup as “unacceptable.”

“Now I feel for the people of my country. I feel for people in Nigeria, because they’re going to be devastated right now. Again, for the second time running, we’re not going to qualify for the World Cup,” Mikel said. “If we don’t qualify for the World Cup, the whole board of the NFF, they need to go. Sorry. They have to go.”

Nigeria’s qualification campaign has been marred by inconsistency, with the Super Eagles sitting outside the automatic qualification places after a series of disappointing draws.

Their latest setback, a 1-1 draw against South Africa in Bloemfontein, leaves their chances hanging by a thread with just two matches left to play.

Mikel, who featured for Nigeria at both the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil and the 2018 edition in Russia, stressed that the problem goes beyond players’ performances.

“Yes, the players have to take responsibility, but the biggest problem is from the top,” he said. “You have to make those players motivated. Find a conducive way. When they come back home to play for Nigeria, they have to feel comfortable. And right now, nobody’s making that comfortable for them.”

The former Chelsea midfielder, who was part of the Nigeria team that made it to the Round of 16 at the 2014 World Cup and also led the team in Russia four years later, argued that Nigeria’s stature in African football makes back-to-back failures unimaginable.

“We are the biggest country, footballing country in Africa. The biggest,” he insisted. “So twice in a row, we don’t qualify? Something is wrong. Something is wrong. A drastic change has to be done.”

Mikel called for urgent reforms and even suggested government intervention if the NFF fails to act. But he also urged Nigerians not to lose hope entirely.

“Still, the dream’s not dead and buried yet. We have two games left. We have to support the team behind the team,” he said. “But I’m saying if we don’t make it, a massive, drastic change has to be done. The whole board of the NFF has to go.”

With Nigeria’s back against the wall, the pressure on the NFF leadership, players, and coaching staff is now at an all-time high. For fans who once watched Mikel lead their nation at the world’s biggest football stage, the fear of missing another World Cup is cutting deep — and calls for sweeping change are only getting louder.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/820490-the-whole-board-of-the-nff-has-to-go-mikel-seeks-drastic-changes-if-super-eagles-fail-to-qualify-for-world-cup.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Femi Fani-Kayode slams fake news on NFF chairmanship,"Former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has dismissed reports claiming he is interested in becoming chairman of the Nigeria Football Association (NFA) now referred to as the Nigeria Football Fedration (NFF). He described the stories as “fake news” spread by unknown blogs.

In a post on his verified X page on Thursday, Mr Fani-Kayode said he has never shown interest in football or its leadership and asked the public to ignore the rumours.

“It has been brought to my attention that fake qoutes are being attributed to me by various unknown blogs claiming that I have an interest in being Chairman of the NFA and that I have now decided to step down from the race to support someone else,” he wrote.

“This is all fake news. I know nothing about the NFA, I have no interest in the NFA or who leads it, I have no interest in football and thankfully I have not been approached or nominated for such a position by anyone and if I had I would have respectfully declined.

“I am not a footballer and I could not care less who the NFA Chairman is or will be.

“The whole thing is deeply insulting and I urge the 419 and criminal blogs that are attributing these quotes to me and coming up with such fake stories to desist from doing so and leave me out of their mess.

“I also urge members of the public to ignore their rubbish. It is good old fashioned fake news and as it is with all fake news they have a hidden agenda.

“Any quote or story that does not emanate from my website (femifanikayode.org), my verified X handle (@realffk) or my verified Facebook and Instagram pages is not from me.

“Anything outside of these platforms are FAKE and I urge members of the public to read such reports with caution.”

Mr Fani-Kayode, who once served as Minister of Culture and Tourism and later as Minister of Aviation is known for his political commentary and legal background. He has not been involved in sports administration at any point in his career.

Critical period

The denial comes at a time when the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), the body in charge of football in the country, is under heavy criticism.

The Super Eagles are struggling in their bid to qualify for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico, raising questions about the state of football leadership in Nigeria.

The current president of the NFF is Ibrahim Gusau, who won the election to lead the federation three years ago. He is serving a four-year term, which can be renewed. His tenure has been marked by challenges, including governance issues and growing pressure as the national team’s World Cup hopes hang in the balance.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/820405-femi-fani-kayode-slams-fake-news-on-nff-chairmanship.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
World Cup Qualifier: “Unauthorised” press statement sparks NFF outrage,"The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has distanced itself from a post-match statement that criticised some Super Eagles players following the team’s 1-1 draw with South Africa in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier.

The statement, issued by the NFF’s Director of Communications, Ademola Olajire, singled out forward Cyriel Dessers and captain William Troost-Ekong for criticism.

It accused Dessers of being sluggish and faulted Ekong for the own goal that gave Bafana Bafana the lead.

However, NFF General Secretary, Mohammed Sanusi, said on Wednesday that the statement did not represent the official position of the Federation.

“I saw the release just like everyone else did. Nobody in the Federation is happy with it,” Mr Sanusi said.

“The NFF did not authorise that statement. We have great respect for all the players. Blaming an individual for a team result is unfair.”

He added that the Federation regards the South Africa match as a collective effort, and will not support attempts to scapegoat any player.

“When we win, it’s a team victory. When we lose, it’s also collective. No player should be singled out,” Mr Sanusi said.

He described the targeted criticism of Troost-Ekong as unjustified, noting that the defender had previously been celebrated as the Most Valuable Player at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Côte d’Ivoire.

“It was an unfortunate own goal. His intention was to clear the ball. Anyone who knows football understands that such things happen,” he said.

Mr Sanusi also expressed confidence in the team’s unity, revealing that efforts were ongoing to regroup and refocus ahead of the remaining qualifiers and AFCON.

“Our house is in order. We’re preparing for the rest of the qualifiers and the AFCON in Morocco,” he said.

“There’s no problem with our players or coaching crew. Our relationship remains cordial. The government and the NFF are proud of the players’ efforts.”

The Federation had initially praised Calvin Bassey for his equalising goal and lamented the team’s failure to convert second-half chances.

But Mr Sanusi made it clear that internal disciplinary action would be taken over the unauthorised release.

“I can assure you the NFF will take action on the matter,” he said.

Nigeria currently sit third in Group C of the CAF World Cup qualifiers with 11 points from eight matches. South Africa lead the group with 17 points.

The Super Eagles must now win their remaining games against Lesotho and Benin Republic, and hope other results go their way to secure qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Hilda Baci’s World Jollof Festival underway in Lagos (PHOTOS),"Nigerian celebrated chef Hilda Baci has flagged off the much-anticipated World Jollof Festival at Eko Hotel Car Park B, Lagos, with an attempt to set a Guinness World Record.

PREMIUM TIMES reported that Baci first revealed plans to attempt cooking the largest pot of Nigerian jollof rice in August and had since been making extensive preparations for the event.

The cooking officially began at 2:08 p.m. when Baci ignited the large pot powered by gas energy beneath it. The process is expected to last for eight hours before the dish is ready for the cheering crowd.

Speaking to this newspaper at the festival, Gino’s brand manager, Bright Mgbemele, described it as a way to promote African unity and showcase the perfection of the continent’s cuisine.

The event drew a massive turnout with close to 10,000 people in attendance.

“It is exciting to see almost 10,000 people gather together over a shared pot of jollof rice. It’s beyond our anticipation, and this is the kind of event we look out for because, for us in Nigeria, jollof is more than a dish,” he said.

“It’s that meal that brings together almost all of Africa. From Lagos city to Monrovia to Accra, we can see the unity that jollof is bringing.

“And what we are doing here is to set jollof on the global stage like never before. We are cooking the biggest pot of jollof rice. We are seeing it happen live.”

He added that the event not only seeks a world record but also celebrates local flavours and innovation.

“By our metrics, we calculated eight hours of cooking time for this dish to be ready for our people. It’s a shared moment for every Nigerian.

“Look at over 10,000 people, happy and smiling with a shared pot of jollof rice. This is showing you the power of jollof rice and food in driving unity, togetherness, and diversity across Africa,” he concluded.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/entertainment/naija-fashion/820635-hilda-bacis-world-jollof-festival-underway-in-lagos-photos.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"World Jollof Festival: Hilda Baci cooks 15,000 Kg of Basmati in six-metre pot before live audience","Nigerian chef Hilda Baci’s much-anticipated World Jollof Festival is currently underway at Eko Hotel Car Park B, Lagos.

PREMIUM TIMES reported that Hilda first revealed plans to attempt cooking the largest pot of Nigerian jollof rice in August and had since been making extensive preparations for the event.

Yesterday, she posted videos on her Instagram page announcing the arrival of key ingredients and materials needed for cooking, including tomatoes, peppers, oil, and a giant pot, among others.

The pot, which was delivered to the venue on Thursday evening, immediately drew widespread attention for its enormous size.

Its arrival not only captivated Nigerians but also sparked amazement when Hilda was seen washing the colossal six-metre-wide vessel with a branded detergent ahead of the festival.

A video of the chef standing inside the custom-made pot as she scrubbed its interior further intrigued netizens, prompting questions about its construction and durability.

Quality assurance

However, in an interview with TVC News at the venue, posted on the TV station’s Instagram page, Hilda addressed these concerns.

She explained how the materials for the giant pot were sourced and assured the public of its quality.

She said, “The materials that were used to fabricate the pot were sourced from the Southwest. The entire process of putting the pots together took about two months. But then, when we got the material and just put it all together, testing it, it took another month. Initially, I had a very ambitious dream to make 5,000 kilograms of raw rice, and we’re using Basmati rice, which is supposed to be 250 bags of Basmati rice. We also need to weigh the food when we’re done, so that we can have a definite quantity, and we don’t have a crane that can weigh it all at the same time.

“Because of that, we had to cut down on the quantity of food. So I cut it down by 1,000 kilograms. So now I’m doing 4,000 kilograms of raw rice, and that is 200 bags of 20 kg Basmati rice. That’s supposed to give us approximately, with the expansion ratio for the rice, about 15,000 kilograms of rice. Give or take, 14,000 to 15,000 kilograms. We might stretch it to 16,000 kilograms of rice because we’re making our own Jollof rice and there’s going to be goat’s milk infused in the rice as well.”

Authenticity

Speaking on how she preserved the authenticity of Nigerian Jollof, Hilda explained that she applied mathematics to handle the calculations.

She added that certain aspects of the cooking were estimated, noting that not everything could be measured with exact precision.

“But when you cook, we also say it’s easy to taste. You need to eyeball it to an extent. So I’ve done the math, and we’re still going to be watching it while the cooking is going on to ensure that everything’s right. Now for the ingredients, I have a fire mix. You know that Gino and I are doing this together.

“So I’m using a combination of our Gino Parsi Jollof mix, our Gino pepper chicken mix, and our Gino Asun paste and cubes. And those three tomato pastes are being combined to make this. I also made a martini sauce tomato base for it. Which is a combination of fresh cayenne pepper, fresh paprika. That’s Tatashe and Vava for the Nigerians here. And onions, garlic, ginger, fresh thyme, fresh basil, seasoning oil, you know and all. And obviously, we have vegetable oil”, she said.

Hilda added that she’ll use Gino curry, thyme, rice water, turkey stock, and turkey pieces in the pot, among other ingredients.

“So it’s a very robust and very expensive pot of rice. And we’re hoping that all this comes together to make a very delicious Gino Asun Jollof rice. So for the tomato paste, what we’re working with is about a thousand kilograms.

“If I’m to put that into quantity, that would give us around 500 cartons of tomato paste. So we have about 200 cartons, and for the onions, I think we’re doing about 600 kilograms of onions. I think we have 750 kilograms of oil as well.”

Backstory

This newspaper learnt that the event, organised in partnership with the seasoning brand Gino, is expected to attract over 20,000 people as Hilda attempts to cook 250 bags of rice.

This was not the first time Hilda had made headlines with a cooking marathon. In May 2023, this newspaper reported that she completed a 100-hour cooking marathon in Lagos.

Her feat earned her global recognition when Guinness World Records (GWR, in June 2023, named her the record holder for the longest individual cooking marathon.

Although she had set out to reach a 100-hour target, GWR officials later explained that a minor error on her part affected the final tally.

Over the four-day marathon, Hilda cooked more than 100 pots of food, surpassing the previous record of 87 hours and 45 minutes set in 2019 by Indian chef Lata Tondon.

However, her reign as record holder was short-lived.

She was later dethroned by Irish chef Alan Fisher, who cooked for 119 hours and 57 minutes, 24 hours longer than Hilda’s record.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/entertainment/naija-fashion/820638-world-jollof-festival-hilda-baci-cooks-15000-kg-of-basmati-in-six-metre-pot-before-live-audience.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
‘I’ll bury my enemies’- Chiwetalu Agu debunks death rumour,"Veteran actor Chiwetalu Agu has broken his silence following online reports of his death.

On Thursday, a Facebook user, Mzansi Celebrities, claimed that the actor died after battling diabetes and undergoing spinal surgery.

The post, which has since gone viral, attracted over 31,000 likes, shared by 801 Facebook pages, and drew numerous comments ranging from sympathy to condemnation.

Reacting to the claim, the Enugu-born actor, in a video posted on his Instagram page on Friday, declared that he is alive, healthy, and in good spirits.

He also expressed shock that bloggers would wish him death.

The 69-year-old said: “I woke up to this very post. All because of likes, views, and comments. A blogger wrongly announced my death. A blogger posted rest in peace with my picture. Now, let me shock you, Chief Chiwetalu Agu isn’t going to die very soon but instead, I’ll be the one to bury my enemies.

“Someone who digs a pit will fall inside and someone who digs a grave will fall inside. I am yet to carry my grandchildren and I must carry them in good health when my children are ready. Someone is already wishing me dead.”

Legal action

Agu further disclosed why he chose not to pursue legal action against the Facebook user who shared his picture with an RIP caption.

“If it were any of these big bloggers in Nigeria. The likes of Tunde, Linda Ikeji, and Gossipmill. I would have sued them for defamation, economic and business damages. Cyber harassment, and misuse of images. Knowing that something will likely come out of the lawsuit but lo and behold, he or she is a poor blogger. He or she is even struggling with likes and views.

“Dear bloggers. I know this is the most attention you’ve ever gotten. In your life. Chiwetalu Agu responded to your post. I guess you can now die a happy person. But what baffles me the most is that in this 21st century, 2025 at that, a lot of people are gullible enough to believe certain news. Without even confirming whether it is true or not”, the actor added.

Agu, who won the 2012 Nollywood Award for Best Actor in Indigenous Movies (Non-English Speaking Language), urged the public to verify information before sharing it online.

He called on his fans to dismiss and challenge rumours about his death, stressing that such falsehoods should not be entertained.

Agu also appealed to his supporters to report any pages circulating such misleading claims about him

“Before rushing to type rest in peace. It’s alright. If you are part of people wishing me bad, you’ll be part of people that I’ll bury in Jesus’ name, Amen.”

PREMIUM TIMES reported that Agu last made headlines when he featured in Mr Macaroni’s skit, “The Avenger of Nollywood”, alongside several well-known actors famed for portraying herbalists in films.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/entertainment/nollywood/820596-ill-bury-my-enemies-chiwetalu-agu-debunks-death-rumour.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Impersonation: ‘Fake’ Bolanle Ninalowo defrauds woman of N33m on TikTok,"As the incidence of impersonation among Nigerian entertainers continues to rise, actor Bolanle Ninalowo is the latest to be affected by the activities of fraudsters.

In 2023, operatives of the Lagos Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, arrested the duo of Charles Osaigbovo and Evans Obayaedo, who impersonated Nigerian actor and movie producer, Fredrick Leonard, for their alleged involvement in a love scam and obtaining money under false pretence to the tune of £38,000.

That same year, 23-year-old Kelvin Enofe was arrested for impersonating Nollywood actor Ik Ogbonna and allegedly defrauding a United States-based woman of $70,000.

The latest in this string of identity theft scams appears to be actor Bolanle Ninalowo.

Incidentally, the actor has previously drawn the attention of social media users to his authentic TikTok account, noting that other accounts using his name are scams.

Identity theft

In a recent development, Olamide Oyetayo & Co has petitioned the EFCC against Mr Bolanle Azeez for impersonation, obtaining money by false pretence, and cyber fraud to the tune of N33m.

The firm is acting as Solicitors to Mrs Victoria Yemisi Ayano.

According to the petition, sometime in July 2024, Ms Ayano was contacted on TikTok by an individual who falsely presented himself as the popular Nigerian actor Bolanle Ninalowo.

“The Suspect, later identified as Mr. Bolanle Azeez, engaged our client in online communications. During which he deceived her with various misrepresentations and solicited funds under the guise of personal and business-related assistance.

“Trusting these representations, Our Client transferred funds in tranches to the Suspect’s designated bank accounts, totalling the sum of N33,000,000 (Thirty-Three Million Naira),” the petition reads.

Upon discovering that she had been defrauded, Ms Ayano reportedly confronted the suspect, who admitted neither guilt nor made any attempt to refund the money.

“He has since cut off communication and remains at large. We have documentary evidence, including WhatsApp messages and bank transfer receipts, which establishes the fraudulent schemes by Mr. Bolanle Azeez,” the statement reads in part.

Reacting to the incident, the actor, who shared a part of the petition on his Instagram page, said that the movie industry he is a part of has not paid him such a lofty sum of money.

He wrote, “This one loud ooo!! N33,000,000.00 for wetin? Lawyer seff go stee collect hin service fee join!

“Which kine juju be dis naaa! Haa!! Even the Nollywood wey blow me never pay me N33M per film.”

More scam alert

Days before, the divorced father of two shared a screenshot of an email he received from a lady who goes by the name Rhonda Wright.

In the mail, the person called him a “Scam Master”, accusing him of scamming her to the tune of $5,000 over the course of two years.

“You are crying about losing funds with Instagram because of my truthful comments about your romance scamming. You have left me no choice but to report you to every media outlet in Nigeria and America, and the 5000 dollars you scammed from me is just enough for the FBI to consider it a felony.

“I have receipts for every dollar taken, and I have enough pictures, emails, screenshots and checks (cheques), not to mention the bank transactions, turning it all in this morning, to my attorney who specialises in international scams and fraud. King Daddy Nino, oh, I mean Bolanle Ninalowo, your 2+years of romance scamming me is over,” the email reads.

According to the actor, having realised that she has been defrauded, the lady in question does her due diligence to find his real Instagram page and email address and has been threatening him.

“I really hope you and many others who fall victim to these impersonators wake up.

“Note: if anyone on this God’s own earth is in a current or about to initiate an online relationship with any one of the many supposed me’s, you are being scammed or are about to,” he wrote.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/entertainment/nollywood/820462-impersonation-fake-bolanle-ninalowo-defrauds-woman-of-n33m-on-tiktok.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
EDITORIAL: Why federal lawmakers don’t deserve upward pay review,"Members of Nigeria’s National Assembly will soon earn bigger emoluments. This is part of a broader upward review of the salaries and allowances of public office holders, orchestrated by the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC). The agency is the body statutorily saddled with the task.

The salaries of the president, vice-president, governors and their deputies, ministers, commissioners and other political appointees will be covered by this upward review, which the Chairman of RMAFC, Mohammed Shehu, said is long overdue. This may have been predicated on the national minimum wage of ₦70,000 that came into effect last year, and its consequential adjustment in the salaries of other workers, alongside the inflationary spiral that has devalued the naira.

However, we are deeply concerned about the pay raise being contemplated for federal legislators against the backdrop of their already humongous monthly emoluments, which remain guarded secrets, even though claims around the amounts involved are highly disturbing. Their underwhelming performance makes any hike odious, reckless and unacceptable.

Way back in 2013, The Economist, an influential London-based newspaper, ranked the Nigerian lawmaker, with an average annual earning of $189,500 (about N30 million), as the second highest paid in the world, when compared with the emolument of legislators in 29 countries, including global economic leaders. The figure is second only to Australia’s, and it is exclusive of other “jumbo allowances.” Despite several economic headwinds that have ravaged Nigeria, there has never been any attempt to address this paradox.

The Senate has passed 96 bills in two years, out of 844 before it, says its President, Godswill Akpabio. This is a poor scorecard. Even more galling is its stewardship in exercising its oversight function. The Senate, for instance, had resolved to investigate the ₦30 trillion “Ways and Means loans” scandal on 20 February 2024, which the Muhammadu Buhari administration had secretly secured from the Central Bank of Nigeria. An ad hoc committee set up for this purpose is yet to present a report on how the funds were used, one year later. The time frame for this ought not to be limitless.

Negligence of duty could explain why this staggering amount was injected into the economy through the back door, without the scrutiny of the Ninth Legislative Assembly. Again, the inertia of the Senate’s 10-member committee set up to probe the state of the moribund Ajaokuta Steel Company and National Ore Mining Company, even with the $498 million paid to contractors since 2008, further underscores their ineptitude in legislative work.

It is sad that the Senate Public Accounts Committee’s efforts to get the NNPC to answer queries on the ₦210 trillion unaccounted for, covering 2017 to 2023, are about to follow the same slippery slope. It involves a ₦103 trillion expenditure and ₦107 trillion in receivables, which the external auditors flagged, and it formed part of the queries of the Auditor-General of the Federation (AGF).

As it is in the Senate, so is it in the House of Representatives, in terms of oversight laxity. Instructively, oversight is the most critical part of the functions of the parliament, carried out by its standing committees to ensure that all agencies of government operate within the framework of transparency and accountability. But this has not been the case. Most financial and civil service regulations are flouted recklessly, as accountability mechanisms simply do not function. The consequence of this is the looting of public funds.

Indolence is writ large in the four senators and 48 members of the House of Representatives who have not contributed to debates during sessions, sponsored bills or presented petitions in the last year. This unfortunate characterisation is highlighted in the Deliberative Barometer Policy-Focus Productivity Report, covering June 2023 and June 2024, released last week.

If the allowances of legislators are a guarded secret, as it has been the practice since 1999, this points to something amiss. Two senators, Shehu Sani and Sumaila Kawu, let the cat out of the bag in 2018 and 2024, respectively, which did not sit well with their colleagues.

Each senator, according to Mr Sani, collected ₦13.5 million monthly emoluments. A BBC report then declared the amount as equivalent to $37,500 or £27,500. “It pricked my conscience and I decided to burst the bubble and open the National Assembly to public scrutiny,” Shehu Sani told the BBC in an interview. In the present 10th National Assembly, the amount has been increased to ₦21 million monthly, which Mr Kawu exposed in August 2024. A member of the House reportedly collects ₦15 million monthly.

Therefore, to increase their salaries and allowances now will give them the carte blanche to seek an enhancement of the ₦21 million and ₦15 million received monthly, amid the massive poverty and hunger in the land. Their unwritten code appears to be: “collapse” all funds due them and pay, even when the presentation of a receipt or evidence of service rendered is required before some of the payments can be made.

There are 469 lawmakers involved, comprising 109 senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives. The RMAFC monthly prepared remuneration of a senator is ₦2,026,400.

Undoubtedly, Nigerian lawmakers are living large, far beyond what they are legally entitled to. While the RMAFC provides a car loan of ₦8.1 million for each senator, they spurned this and budgeted ₦57.6 billion, with which a Toyota Land Cruiser SUV was procured for each senator, and a Toyota Prado SUV for each member of the House of Representatives in November 2023. Each of the SUVs cost at least ₦160 million then.

In August 2024, the President of the Senate, Godswill Akpabio, announced on the floor of the chamber that, “In order to enable us enjoy our holidays, a token has been sent to our various accounts by the Clerk of the National Assembly.” That “token” was ₦2 million, whereas RMAFC’s legitimate provision is ₦248,424 for the recess allowance. It is quite unnerving that the ₦2 million gifted as a holiday token is actually a professor’s salary for four months.

More insights into the over-reach of legislators are evident in the funds budgeted for their constituency projects. The disproportionate sharing of money forced Senator Jarigbe Agom-Jarigbe to squeal last year that ranking senators had their projects funded up to ₦500 million, while others got far less for their own projects. However, a ranking senator, Enyinnaya Abaribe, claimed to have his projects funded up to the tune of only ₦266 million.

The RMAFC may have whetted the lawmakers’ appetite for more money with its proposal, but the plot precedes this 10th Assembly. While Oniofiok Luke, in the House of Representatives, moved a motion for the salaries of judicial officers to be reviewed in 2022, the Deputy Speaker, Idris Wase, sought an amendment to it for the inclusion of public office holders. The current presidential Chief of Staff, Femi Gbajabiamila, had presided over that deliberation as the speaker.

In the 2025 budget, BudgetIT has uncovered the insertion of 11,122 projects by federal lawmakers for which ₦6.9 trillion was set aside to take care of, in a total appropriation with a deficit of over ₦13.08 trillion. These are projects claimed to be largely executed by cronies of legislators or their shell companies, without following laid-down public procurement guidelines.

These abuses and rascality must not continue. The business of lawmaking is a public duty, not for self-aggrandising and inconsiderate cohorts. The job should be for the patriotic and citizens with ideas on how to make the country better, and not for leeches to continue profiteering from the public purse.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/819453-editorial-why-federal-lawmakers-dont-deserve-upward-pay-review.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
EDITORIAL: Preventing another imminent round of deadly flooding!,"Alarm bells have been ringing from environmental authorities, over the likelihood of flooding from this year’s heavy rainfalls. They are urging citizens to evacuate from flood plains and for public agencies to redouble their efforts in forestalling the disaster before it occurs. In this context, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has put a lot of states in the North on alert, as the water levels of River Niger rises menacingly upstream in the Republic of Benin.

Three states – Kebbi, Niger and Kwara – have been identified to be at high-risk because of their proximity to the Republic of Benin. Despite this, nine other states and 25 locations are also in the vulnerability loop. The continuous rise of the water levels of the river will invariably result in the overflow of its banks and the submersion of coastal communities. In its wake would be mass deaths and the destruction of houses, alongside other invaluable property.

To forestall the impact, especially in terms of the loss of lives, the Director-General of NEMA, Zubaida Umar, has directed officials of the agency in charge of coastal communities to ramp up their advocacy and sensitisation for the residents of these areas to evacuate to safer and higher grounds. The states at high-risk and other helpless ones have been charged to activate their State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) and their Local Emergency Management Committees (LEMC) to avoid any tier of government being caught off-guard when the chips are down.

Non-adherence to safety protocols and environmental abuses led to the Mokwa flooding disaster in June, which claimed 200 lives, while 500 others were declared missing. Children and women were largely the victims. It was the worst of such disaster in 60 years. The overnight deluge washed away a bridge on a major road in the area, which inevitably cut off the north from the southern part of the country. Its impact on the economy, especially in relation to the movement of trucks transporting food and other essential goods ,was telling.

One of the survivors, Adamu Yusuf, agonizingly told the BBC: “I watched helplessly as water washed away my family and I survived because I could swim.” That tragedy put the country in the global spotlight for the wrong reason.

There are four months remaining in 2025. From weather forecasts of the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency, the dreadful days are not yet over. The agency predicts that 554 communities and 142 Local Government Areas are susceptible to flash floods from heavy rainfalls between July and September. Also, October to November may be the “Ides of March” period for 484 communities across 56 LGAs in states that have been put on alert. They include Adamawa, Sokoto, Zamfara, Katsina, Kano, Gombe, Borno, Bauchi, Jigawa and Benue. Communities on the Jebba – Lokoja flood plains are among the most endangered.

The raising of alerts by federal agencies are not enough in addressing this challenge. There is a sense in which it could be said that governance has failed on this level. When residents of flood plains are advised to evacuate, there are no arrangements regarding where they could move to. This makes them somewhat indifferent to calls to escape the imminent danger.

The 2012 and 2022 flooding disasters, which claimed 306 lives and displaced 1.3 million people during the former period; and more than 603 lives, alongside the destruction of 82,053 houses, displacement of 1.302 million persons, and submersion of 332,327 hectares of farmland during the latter period, offer experiences in hindsight, which any proactive government could use towards the prevention of similarly anticipated humanitarian crises.

As such, the failings that arose during the Mokwa flooding, must not be allowed to repeat themselves. We urge states and local governments to build temporary shelters for those identified to be living along flood plains to evacuate to. This is a basic and irreducible minimum expected of them. In fact, as Governor Chukwuma Soludo remarked in 2022, “We can no longer deal with perennial flooding as an emergency. We knew it would happen. We know the next one will come.”

It smacks of playing Russian roulette with the lives of Nigerians by toying with the necessity of dredging the lower River Niger from Warri to Baro in Niger State. The Senate said it provided funds for this in the 2024 Appropriation Act. If properly carried out, the River Niger’s water level has less chance of its banks overflowing.

Curiously, the late Musa Yar’Adua/Goodluck Jonathan presidencies provided a combined ₦43.3 billion for the project. And during an international conference and exhibition by the Nigeria Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) in 2014, Jonathan declared the dredging of the river completed. But the lack of marine activities like shipping and vessel movement in inland waterways transportation make the former president’s claim empty. This is unfortunate.

What is clear is Nigeria’s indecisiveness and lack of transparency in dredging the River Niger. Equally worrisome is the non-commitment to the agreement with Cameroon for Nigeria to complete the Dasin Hausa Dam to act as a buffer against excess water releases from its Lagdon Dam. When released, water from this dam regularly submerges many states and communities in the country. This official indifference should cease!

The foregoing data of damage from the annual flooding debacles are not mere statistics, but evidence of a high-stakes act resulting in the continuous loss of human lives; in addition to massive losses of habitations, farmlands and property. This brings to the fore the economic dimension of the crisis, as food security is affected due to the submersion of hundreds of thousands of hectares of farmland across the country. The economic effects keep exacerbating the toxic security situation in the country.

Some of these catastrophes are unavoidable, as also consequent upon global warming and other extreme weather events. But their impacts could be mitigated through pragmatic policies acted on as and when due. The wise counsel of the United Nations World Meteorological Agency that “flash flood gives limited time for reaction” is a tool for proactive engagement by the authorities towards saving the lives of Nigerians vulnerable to this existential challenge.

The UN weather agency states that globally there are 5,000 deaths resulting from flooding annually, which more so leaves behind a staggering $50 billion in economic losses. Its tolls on Nigeria, however, could be reduced if we embrace appropriate environmental and urban planning preventive policies. Those who trifle with nature’s fury do so at their own peril.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/817756-editorial-preventing-another-imminent-round-of-deadly-flooding.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"EDITORIAL: With the present moratorium, it is time to reinvent Nigerian varsities","Reason and logic prevailed at last, penultimate week, when the federal government admitted the fact of the systemic dysfunction and proliferation of tertiary institutions in the country. As a result, it imposed a seven-year moratorium on the establishment of new universities, polytechnics and colleges of education at the federal level, so that the inadequacies in existing ones can be fixed.

This crucial policy decision was taken at a Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Bola Tinubu. The underpinnings of this resolve were damning: the apparent lack of rigour in planning and evaluating the tertiary institutions landscape to determine the number Nigeria really needs. And, how sustainable they are.

Details of the policy shift, as unfolded by the Minister of Education, Tunji Alausa, revealed that 34 universities never had a single student applicant to them in last year’s Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) conducted by the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB). Also, a total of 199 universities had fewer than 100 applicants through JAMB.

Similarly, polytechnics and colleges of education had a shortage of applicants, to the extent that 64 colleges of education had zero applicants. One university in the north, the minister added, ironically has 1,200 members of staff, as against its enrolment of less than 800 students. As it is obvious, the jaded argument of the lack of access to university education has officially been laid to rest in the country. Duplications of institutions and waste of resources are sticking points, as is capacity under-utilisation in some, while others are operating above their carrying capacities.

“The moratorium will allow the government to refocus resources on improving existing institutions by upgrading facilities, recruiting qualified staff and expanding their carrying capacity,” Mr Alausa said.

Nigeria has 72 universities, 42 polytechnics and 28 colleges of education that belong to the federal government. The states have 67 universities, while the privately-owned ones are 147. Yet, the approval of nine new private universities on the very day the moratorium was imposed on federal institutions was inconsistent with the policy intent. There are 339 universities in the country, out of which 159 are privately-owned, according to ASUU President Christopher Piwuna.

A national interest education policy of this nature, in our view, carries little or no weight without an outline of the detailed measures to be taken and timelines for reversing the rot. The situation calls for emergency action.

Underfunding is critical to the decline of Nigerian universities. And, this has placed ASUU in the trenches for decades, resulting in the total loss of academic calendars, or distortions, and the award of degrees that have lost their values both at home and abroad.

Just last Thursday, ASUU announced its preparedness to resume its suspended strike over the federal government’s failure to honour agreements it reached with it, such as that of 2009 on the revitalisation of the system and payment of staff allowances. This involved the anticipated injection of ₦1.3 trillion into the system in tranches of ₦200 billion for the first year and ₦220 billion annually over the next five years. This was only done in 2013.

Unfortunately, the government’s foot-dragging on its implementation of the agreement and the unwarranted establishment of newer tertiary institutions have complicated the inadequacies of university education in the country. This is evident in the lack of basic facilities like water, electricity, sufficient lecture halls, students’ halls of residence, outdated libraries, ill-equipped laboratories, low research funding, and manpower shortages.

University lecturers are so poorly paid that senior professors receive about ₦500,000 per month, while a senator allegedly collects a monthly emolument of ₦21 million. It is an unjust reward system that should be revised. Academics are so indigent that many cannot subscribe to foreign journals in their respective disciplines. They deserve to be well paid, otherwise our ivory towers will keep losing their essence as centres of excellence for teaching, learning, research and innovation.

Nigerians periodically weigh in with advisories, including the media. For instance, PREMIUM TIMES, in two scathing editorials on 10 and 31 March, had counselled against the 50 – 66 per cent dissipation of TETFund’s resources, as entrenched in the Tax Reform Bill, from 2025. It was programmed to receive zero funding in 2030 and thereafter. To us, this is “at odds with the progress of tertiary education in Nigeria.” Funding from it has been the only lifeline to universities and allied institutions on infrastructural renewal since its existence.

In the first quarter of this year, the government created nine new universities, when existing ones were in dire need of funds and facilities. The Minister of Education also decried the political pressure on the president to set up new universities and made the shocking revelation that over 200 bills for new ones were in the National Assembly. The drivel of turning universities into “constituency projects” which lawmakers attract should stop.

Sadly, President Tinubu had before now imbibed the recklessness of former Presidents Goodluck Jonathan and Muhammadu Buhari in setting up universities. Some principal officers of the National Assembly now have universities in their villages, which triggered our fiery editorial of 31 March entitled, “Tinubu, stop this gratuitous proliferation of universities.”

Therein, we had pointed out that: “We recommend to Tinubu the minutes of the 2013 FEC meeting of 1 November on the reports of the needs of Universities. The Council found out that students cannot get accommodation; where they get, they are packed like sardines in a tiny room and there is no light and water in their hostels, classrooms and laboratories.”

If there is a desire to reinvent or re-imagine the system now, it has to be meticulously done to achieve the desired result. The ₦1.3 trillion, which ought to have been injected into the universities between 2013 and 2017, based on the 2009 ASUU/FG pact, is about 10 times in value now, given the devaluation of the naira. We need a funding Marshal Plan towards the revitalisation of the system.

The moratorium on the creation of federal tertiary institutions that equally affected private polytechnics and colleges of education should have been extended to privately-owned universities too. All of them draw from the same academic manpower pool, which should justify their inclusion. Proliferation has thinned the human resources in the first and second generations of universities, such that they regularly lose the accreditation of their courses.

The 2012 Needs Assessment of Universities had identified 34,000 PhD gaps, which is a basic qualification for teaching at this level. What the gap in 2025 might be, with the massive increase in universities, is better imagined. There are four federal universities in many states, including Imo, which is indicative of the rule of thumb at play, rather than planning.

At a time when the quality of our degrees is suspect, the federal government announced the plan for more degree mills, with polytechnics and colleges of education being turned into degree-awarding institutions. This irrational policy should stop. If the universities are structurally deficient in their academic programmes, the situation in these lower tertiary layers would even be worse.

Since 2018, the information in the public space, as revealed by JAMB Registrar Ishaq Oloyede, is that some 600,000 existing spaces in the country’s 150 universities take care of the concern of Nigerians about access. However, the authorities never listened. Data and national interest took flight. A total of 1.6 million candidates sat the 2018 UTME, out of which only 700,000 had the minimum O-level credits in five subjects, including English language and Mathematics, which is the requirement for admission. And not all made the cut-off marks of their respective universities for admission. This has been a yearly trend.

The National Universities Commission (NUC) should be more rigorous in giving its approval for the establishment of new private universities. Those without applicants and others operating below capacity purportedly met all the criteria for their existence when approved. And, with what is now known of these institutions and the racketeering in the accreditation of courses, whereby academics are hired from other universities for the exercise, these raise integrity questions about the Commission’s regulatory oversight.

Nigeria can’t reinvent the wheel in ivory tower education. As global entities, there are universal values or standards, whether in teacher-to-students ratio, criteria for professorial appointments, vice-chancellorships or membership/leadership of their governing councils, that cannot fall below those subscribed to in other parts of the world, from Europe to America and even Asia.

Failing on these metrics has been exposing the Nigerian system to corruption of sorts. In 2017, for instance, a panel set up to review the promotion of professors in a federal university in the South-east, recommended that 27 out of 31 promoted should be demoted. In 2018, seven other professors were demoted in another federal university in the South-south.

But our universities could rediscover their groove, if academics and administrators in the ilk of Kenneth Dike, JF Ade Ajayi and Adamu Baike could be discovered, and appointed to lead these institutions, according to the foremost of standards. Importantly, the chairpersons of their governing councils should, more so, not be products of political patronage and aliens to the academic environment. It would take round pegs in round holes to do all it takes to restore the Nigerian academy to its requisite glory.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/opinion/editorial/816285-editorial-with-the-present-moratorium-it-is-time-to-reinvent-nigerian-varsities.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
EDITORIAL: Israel’s targeted mass killing of Gaza journalists must stop,"Israel’s killing of five journalists in Gaza a few days ago has sparked global outrage and condemnation. The carnage is a reminder of the apocalyptic danger that journalists face in the discharge of their all-important duty of holding power to account. Four of the latest victims were Al-Jazeera journalists covering the humanitarian situation in Gaza and are part of the over 270 killed so far since the Israeli onslaught on the erstwhile Palestinian enclave began. This is evil and unacceptable!

A drone strike on 10 August claimed the life of Anas Al-Sharif, a 28-year-old Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, who had been on Israel’s wanted list for so long. He was eliminated alongside his cameraman, Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Qreiqeh, and another photojournalist, Mohammed Noufa. A total of seven people were killed in that attack outside the gate of Al-Shifa Hospital.

As an endangered species, in no other part of the world have journalists been butchered more than in Gaza, since 7 October 2023, when Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, breached Israel’s territory. In the process, about 1,195 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed in a social gathering, with some 250 others taken as hostages. Israel’s reprisal quickly morphed into a full-scale bombardment, with benumbing consequences to date.

Since then, Al Jazeera reports that it has lost 50 journalists, while its website lists 269 Palestinian, three Lebanese, and two Israeli journalists as having been killed so far. But the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) claims that about 186 journalists have died from the conflict. A broad global consensus is that genocide, rather than a war, is what is going on in Gaza.

The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have tried to rationalise Al-Sharif’s killing. They claim that details of an intelligence report at their disposal allegedly showed that he was a member of Hamas, with his name in their personnel roster, payroll, phone directories and training courses. However, this claim is being challenged by the CPJ. It argues that, “Israel’s pattern of labelling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom.” This view is shared by the Foreign Press Association and many more.

A joint statement by the BBC, Reuters, AP and AFP in July expressed “desperate concern” about journalists in Gaza, who were unable to feed themselves or their families. The UN Human Rights Office, in its post on X, said, “We call for immediate safe and unhindered access to Gaza for all journalists.”

All international media outlets have been barred from entering Gaza to report on the extent of the devastation and humanitarian situation there. This is certainly not without reason, even if a perverse one at that. Brown University in the US, in its project on the cost of the attacks, asserts that it is the deadliest theatre of conflict for journalists in history. This is a conclusion supported by the fact that the death toll, so far, outnumbers that of the World Wars I and II, Korean War, Vietnamese War, US Civil War, Yugoslavia War and the post-COVID-19 war in Afghanistan combined. This is mind-numbing and simply incredible.

Barring journalists’ entry into Gaza is a grave signpost of the conflict. As the CPJ argued, and rightly so, this enables a void of news, with the unfortunate lack of documentation of the war crimes being committed. This concern is sufficient to evoke more global attention on the conflict and strategies to end it. Amnesty International, the global human rights watchdog, aptly says, the “attack is not just against journalists but journalism itself.”

Some of the journalists killed earlier, in 2023 and 2024, were in refugee centres where relief materials were being distributed to victims of the conflict. Among them were Ismail al-Ghoul and a cameraman, Shati, with clear identities as journalists, which was embossed on their vests, while the vehicle they moved about in also had a media tag. Lamentably, 2024 was the deadliest year for journalists worldwide, with 124 deaths, as recorded by CPJ since its three decades of keeping this surreal account.

Journalists’ lives matter! This cannot be said enough. “Journalists everywhere must be allowed to work without fear of being targeted,” as a message from the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, read.

The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, needs to be reminded constantly that there are rules of engagement in conflict. With Gaza totally in ruin and uninhabitable and about to be seized for Israel’s total occupation, John Austin’s theory that “International law is not really law” resonates, because of the vacuity of enforcement, largely.

Mr Netanyahu’s eerie plan is a mutation of an earlier proposal of his ally, President Donald Trump, who had hinted about turning the city into a Riviera for the US. Its original inhabitants were to be relocated to other countries of the world. Trump, so far, has been stoking, rather than smothering, the fire of this conflict.

Netanyahu’s adoption of this terrifying and imminent phase of permanent occupation, amid the ever-defiance of Hamas, means that the lives of more journalists are on the line. “Erase Gaza. Nothing else will satisfy us,” the battle cry of the Deputy Speaker of the Israeli parliament, Nissim Vaturi, voiced on 9 October 2023, appears frighteningly real at this point. Particularly, as Mr Netanyahu’s war cabinet has endorsed the permanent occupation of Gaza.

But from France, Canada, UK and Australia are signs of a new chapter in the conflict, with their avowal to accord recognition to the State of Palestine, in a two state solution agenda that refuses to go away, come September, during the next General Assembly of the United Nations, though with certain conditions that Palestinians must meet in military and policy reforms. Only France is prepared to embrace this unconditionally.

The relentless onslaught on Gaza has already claimed thousands of lives, with over 270 journalists dead, and created an unimaginable humanitarian catastrophe that all people and nations of conscience must come together as a pressure group to end immediately.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/opinion/editorial/814806-editorial-israels-targeted-mass-killing-of-gaza-journalists-must-stop.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
EDITORIAL: IDPs and waning donor support: Time for a sustained response!,"For over two decades, non-state actors have wreaked havoc in Nigeria, creating humanitarian crises of unimaginable proportions in the process. The consequence has been the oddity of Internally Displaced Persons camps in several parts of the country. The insurgency of groups like Boko Haram and ISWAP, alongside banditry, kidnapping and killer-herdsmen, is the key driver of this malady. Natural calamities such as flooding have added to the conundrum.

As a result, Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states in the North-east, the epicentre of jihadist violence; to Benue, Plateau and Niger states in the North-central; in addition to Zamfara, Kebbi, Sokoto, Katsina and Kano states in the North-west zone, have not been the same, as they are ridden with severe existential challenges.

The welfare of the hordes displaced by these crises has largely been borne by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, alongside the World Food Programme (WFP) and supplies from other global donors. These organisations provide not just food but primary healthcare services to the IDPs. There were 3.7 million people in this demographic basket across Nigeria at the end of 2024, according to the Internally Displaced Monitoring Centre (IDMC).

Without doubt, the figure is rising with the mindless and perennial killings and burning of villages in Benue and Plateau states by killer-herders and other actors in recent months.

Sadly, the donor support to these IDPs from the WFP has declined considerably with the global funding cuts of the UN, following the withdrawal of support from the United States under the Donald Trump presidency. The WFP’s head of operations in the North-east, Trust Mlambo, recently told the BBC, “We don’t have any more to give after this (month) cycle. Our warehouses are empty and we are desperate for any generous donations.” To keep hope alive, $620 million is needed urgently to cater to Nigeria’s IDPs and related emergencies in the Sahel, the WFP has stated.

Before now, the rationing of food, with attendant severe malnutrition, had been routine in the IDP camps. A major International support group, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) – Doctors without Borders, says that fatality data of malnourished children in the first six months of 2025 was 652. This doubled the tally of 2024.

The North-east zone has about 1.4 million IDPs and 150 donor-funded clinics, treating malnourished citizens, mostly children. These facilities are on the cusp of ceasing to exist if support doesn’t come from other quarters. MSF’s representative in Nigeria, Ahmed Aldikhari, said that this apocalyptic fright had been on since 2024 when the US, UK and the European Union had either withdrawn or scaled down their support.

Until this negative turn of the tide, 60 per cent of the funding of the UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs activities in Nigeria came from the US. Its report on Nigeria’s 2025 humanitarian challenges in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, clearly states that 1.8 million children risk acute malnutrition if nothing is done to roll this back in time.

Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State, whose domain is the most hobbled by this existential challenge, has vigorously embraced the resettlement of the IDPs, beginning with 5,000 in the five communities of Goniri, BulaKunye, Mayanti, Abaram and Darajamal, for them to actively engage in farming to feed themselves this year.

The strategy is underpinned by the construction of 1,000 housing units in the communities for effectiveness and the digging of defence trenches for safety. Mr Zulum held strategic meetings with members of the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) in the area and approved a six-month payment of allowances to new recruits, to help protect the citizens, as they go about tilling the soil for food production.

This is a pragmatic engagement that should be spread across the country. For the record, Zulum’s administration has expended ₦40 billion in food and other supplies to the IDPs in four years, as of the end of 2024.

Philanthropists like Aliko Dangote, Abdul Samad Rabiu, Femi Otedola, Tony Elumelu and other wealthy Nigerians should heed the clarion call of WFP for “more generous donations” to avoid greater disaster befalling IDPs and those in these embattled parts of Nigeria. Imminent starvation with possible resultant death is real.

But scarier is the likelihood of hunger forcing the IDPs, especially the youths among them, to become willing recruits of the insurgents. They had openly threatened to “enter the bush” – a metaphor for evil self-help – during a hunger-induced protest in Dikwa and Mafa last year, 2024.

The situation is so dire that WFP Director for West Africa, Margret Van der Velden, joined the Save Our Souls call on donor support for Nigeria’s IDPs. In March, she had sounded the alarm that “Food security is national security.” This is absolutely so! Some of these agencies have been visiting governors to sensitise them on the enormity of the task before them. We urge the Bill Gates Foundation to lend a listening ear and yield to the call for assistance with regard to this emergency, in view of its huge track record of support for crucial humanitarian interventions in Nigeria.

IDP camps all over the world are essentially transitory, due to their unusual nature. And, the Kampala Convention prescribes global standards for exiting them. But this has not been the case in Nigeria, as a result of the poverty of leadership, misplacement of priorities, and corruption. The 2021 IDPs transition framework, which takes cognisance of this fact, should be made to work.

The provision of shelter, education and economic opportunities must be created for IDPs in order for them to transit to meaningful new lives. Therefore, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) should scale up its service delivery and operate with more accountability. There have been cases in the past when relief materials for the needy were unfortunately diverted. Last year, for instance, Governor Hyacinth Alia of Benue State intercepted a truckload of such materials.

President Bola Tinubu’s recent charge to governors to water the grass more was a subtle jab at their poor welfare performance in relation to the downtrodden and general governance measures toward enhanced food security for all.

Already, Borno State has crafted a “Strategy for Durable Solution to Internally Displaced Persons for 2025–2027”, which we recommend to other embattled states. However, the action plan is not a substitute for tackling the key drivers of insecurity in the region and beyond. The Nigerian State must wake up to the challenge of subduing insurgency, kidnapping, banditry and killer-herders.

No country in the world can truly thrive and be worthy of the notion of sovereignty when crucial parts of its demographic are continuously susceptible to bloodshed and human degradation over protracted periods. More so, with the State showing the lack of capacity or sustained concern in responding to the needs of the vulnerable, and largely abandoning the task to the charity of international organisations and groups. This is a huge indictment of the leadership and an indication of the erosion of the State.

It will augur well if the Tinubu administration pays real attention to nuetering the drivers of conflict and instability in the country, while acting in a more responsive and sustained manner to the lot of its citizens who have fallen victims of conflict and other debilitating situations, a critical segment of which are IDPs.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/813316-editorial-idps-and-waning-donor-support-time-for-a-sustained-response.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
EDITORIAL: Redeeming Nigeria’s image crisis globally,"Anti-Nigerian protests erupted in Ghana last week over alleged criminal misconducts, which its citizens claim have become pervasive and toxic to their security and moral well-being. The alleged vices include kidnapping, aspects of cybercrime known as ‘yahoo-yahoo’, ritual killing and prostitution.

Placards on display at Obro Spot, a popular rendezvous in Accra, by these disenchanted Ghanaians on 29 July, encapsulated the grievances in bold relief. “Armed robbery and violent attacks must stop.” “Nigerians are kidnapping and using people for rituals.” “Nigerians must go because you can’t be in someone’s country and be doing anyhow,” were seen in a viral video clip.

PREMIUM TIMES condemns such criminal behaviour and indeed all forms of malfeasance by Nigerians living not just in Ghana, but in other parts of the world. The severity of the protest was so disturbing that the authorities in Abuja swiftly dispatched the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Bianca Odumegwu-Ojukwu, to Ghana, to engage with the people and authorities. She met not just President John Mahama, but Ghana’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Samuel Ablakwa, and community leaders.

She returned with the cheery news from President Mahama to President Bola Tinubu, not to lose any sleep over the incident. He highlighted the bonds of friendship and brotherhood that existed between both countries, which stretched to the colonial era. Minister Ojukwu met with the Nigerian community in Ghana and urged them to always live within the bounds of the law of their host country.

There are many Nigerians living in Ghana who have taken advantage of the ECOWAS protocol on the free movement of people, goods and services, to go there, pursue their university education, and establish businesses, among other endeavours. However, some with criminal tendencies have equally exploited the same protocol to live there and perpetrate heinous acts as their stock in trade.

Certainly, they are few in number, whether in Ghana, South Africa or the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where similar protests have occurred. In some instances, Nigerians view these protests only through xenophobic lenses. This is wrong. There are real concerns in some of these host societies. Disturbingly, this is a situation that is growing globally. As often said, when one finger touches oil, it soils the others. As citizens carrying Nigeria’s passport, these people engaging in unfortunate conduct tarnish the country’s image. And the consequences are evident in the policy responses of a number of host countries in the wake of bad behaviour involving our nationals. Quite sadly, Nigerians at home and abroad are tarred with the same brush of a general perception and reaction.

For instance, the United Arab Emirates imposed a visa ban on Nigerians in 2019, which, though later lifted, now has very stringent conditions attached to the application for and granting of visas, which retain the more subtle features of a ban still. This has been the consequence of the flagrant breaches of their laws by some Nigerians. That same year, eight Nigerians were sentenced to death for armed robbery, following their December 2016 heist in Dubai and other parts of the United Arab Emirates.

Again, in April of the same year, five of our nationals were arrested for armed robbery that involved Dh2.3 million in a Bureau de change in Sharjah. Also, there have been violent clashes involving rival Eiye and Black Axe cult groups, the destruction of properties, and yelling at apartment parking lots in July 2022. This was the situation that alarmed the UAE authorities to the danger of their liberal immigration policy towards Nigeria.

The upshot has been quite telling. Presently, there is no visa for Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 45 to the UAE, unless the travel is on a family basis. And, to grant such a visa, a six-month bank statement of account with a minimum of $10,000 in it, a return flight ticket, evidence of secured accommodation, and a verifiable residential address at home must accompany all visa applications. This restriction affects not just tourists but business visas as well, which is an outcome that affects our economy negatively.

In April, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) began the investigation of 24 Nigerian youths apprehended in Ghana over internet fraud. They had been nabbed on 17 April at Kumsark Estate in Oyarifa, downtown Accra, by the Ghanaian Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO), which swiftly transferred them to Nigeria.

But at the core of this evil trend is the lack of opportunities at home, especially jobs for school leavers at all levels, the broken moral fabric of the society, predilection for the acquisition of wealth without any evidence of livelihood and the failure of our society to reject this. Things are made worse by the brazen looting of the public treasury by public office holders, which has rendered Nigeria prostrate and systemically dysfunctional.

Therefore, Nigerian youths have embraced illicit paths as the routes to survival. Those who can export these vices to other countries are doing so. Rahmon Abbas, alias Hushpuppi, did so and was, in fact, the most notorious kingpin and perverse role model in this regard. But in 2022, he was convicted of fraud and money laundering, in a case that involved over $300 million, for which he bagged a 20-year jail term in the United States.

On 7 May this year, the police arrested two fugitives, Felix Omoregie and Okwudiri Ezeje, wanted in Belgium and Dubai respectively. Omoregie had been on the radar of Interpol since 19 December, 2023, over human trafficking in Brussels, France and Italy. A search in his hideout apartment in Lagos revealed a new passport with Canada as the country he had planned to relocate to. Ezeje is a member of a robbery syndicate in Dubai.

When the criminalities are not cybercrime, robbery, or human trafficking, these shady figures are implicated in the abuse of the immigration laws of their host country, through overstays. This is rampant in the United States and the United Kingdom and has compelled these and other countries to tighten their immigration laws against Nigerians.

In May, the Times of London reported that the UK authorities were mulling stricter measures for Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Pakistan citizens in obtaining their visa, due to the high rate of illegal extension of their permits. Canada, once known for its liberal visa policy, has joined the stricture bandwagon. A bank statement with a proof of N17 million is now required for any visa application to the country.

However, the interesting thing is that these malevolent hordes are not the true face of Nigeria. Across the world, Nigeria’s true ambassadors bestride billions of dollar businesses, entrepreneurship, academia, sports and technology.

Nigeria has many citizens who are hugely successful. One of them, Adebayo Ogunlesi’s company, Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), owns significant stakes in the Gatwick and Edinburgh Airports in the UK. Also, Chinedu Echeruo, a tech innovator, sold his HotStop App for $1 billion in 2017, while Anthony Joshua is a World Heavy Weight boxing champion and Tobi Amusan, a world record holder in women’s 100 meters hurdle. They add to an endless roll call of the true faces of Nigeria.

We advise countries where Nigerians pose criminal threats to make the suspects face the full wrath of the law without hesitation. Back home, the EFCC should redouble its efforts in fighting the scourge of criminality, having already admitted that it is a disturbing and growing trend. Cybercrime now has training academies in Lagos, Abuja, Delta and Anambra states to underscore this point. States must move beyond rhetoric and give bite to their existing anti-crime laws to show that such nefarious activities do not pay.

Truly, our national image has been dented very badly; hence, only an equally aggressive law enforcement and values reorientation pushback will do, in redeeming Nigeria’s standing, both locally and within the global community.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/opinion/editorial/811776-editorial-redeeming-nigerias-image-crisis-globally.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Resident doctors issue 24-hour ultimatum over unmet demands,"The Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) has issued a fresh 24-hour ultimatum to the federal government to address its outstanding demands, following the expiration of an earlier 10-day deadline on 10 September.

NARD had, on 1 September, threatened a nationwide industrial action if the government failed to resolve pending issues within 10 days.

In a communiqué issued after its Extraordinary National Executive Council (E-NEC) meeting held virtually on Wednesday, the association said it resolved to grant the government one final 24-hour window.

The doctors said failure to comply will result in a five-day warning strike, commencing on Friday, 12 September.

“The E-NEC mandates the NOC to ensure the immediate payment of the outstanding Medical Residency Training Fund (MRTF) within 24 hours and to facilitate the resolution of other pending matters as a demonstration of good faith from the government,” it said.

“Failure to comply will result in a five-day warning strike, commencing at 8:00 a.m. on Friday, 12 September 2025.”

Demands, Grievances

The association decried the government’s refusal to pay five months of arrears from the 25/35 per cent Consolidated Medical Salary Structure (CONMESS) review, along with other outstanding salary arrears.

It also conveyed disappointment at the federal government’s failure to fulfil its commitments regarding the release of funds for the payment of the outstanding 2025 MRTF to numerous resident doctors.

It said these doctors remain unpaid despite multiple ultimatums and extensions.

It also criticised the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria for downgrading membership certificates from the West African Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons.

“The E-NEC also received an update on the woefully inadequate efforts exerted by the Oyo State government to tackle the challenges confronting members of the ARD LAUTECH Teaching Hospital, Ogbomosho, amidst an ongoing indefinite strike action at the institution.

“The E-NEC condemned the negligence exhibited by most state governments in paying the MRTF to resident doctors under their employ, deeming this an act of gross insensitivity.”

It also expressed disappointment in the federal government’s failure to address its demands despite numerous ultimatums issued.

NARD had, in July, issued a three-week ultimatum, but in the interest of industrial harmony, the NEC extended the deadline to allow for further engagement with stakeholders.

Call to action

To avert industrial action, the doctors are demanding the immediate disbursement of the 2025 MRTF and the settlement of five months of outstanding CONMESS arrears, along with other unpaid allowances.

They also called on the MDCN to restore recognition of the West African postgraduate membership certificates and urged the National Postgraduate Medical College of Nigeria to promptly issue certificates to qualified candidates in line with international best practices.

They also urged Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State to address the grievances of doctors at LAUTECH Teaching Hospital, Ogbomosho, who remain on strike.

The council further appealed to all state governors to prioritise doctors’ welfare, ensure timely payment of MRTF, and take proactive measures to curb emigration while maintaining industrial harmony.

Looming disaster

The resident doctors comprise the bulk of medical personnel in Nigeria’s tertiary hospitals; hence, healthcare services are often crippled when they embark on strike.

The warning from NARD comes amid ongoing strikes in other parts of the country.

The Association of Resident Doctors in the Federal Capital Territory (ARD-FCT) began a seven-day warning strike on Monday to drive home their demands.

Among the issues the doctors highlighted were a lack of manpower, poor welfare, unpaid salaries, unexplained deductions, and the psychological toll of long working hours.

The association noted that no new employment had taken place in FCT hospitals since 2011, forcing resident doctors to cover multiple departments.

PREMIUM TIMES’ checks at health facilities in Abuja on Tuesday showed patients are heavily bearing the brunt of the industrial action, with several departments shut down and only emergency cases being attended to.

Similarly, resident doctors at the Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University Teaching Hospital (COOUTH), Awka, Anambra, on Thursday began a seven-day warning strike to demand better working conditions.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/820538-resident-doctors-issue-24-hour-ultimatum-over-unmet-demands.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Island in Peril: How Lagos’s water crisis endangers lives despite funding,"On a mildly sunny morning in January, Blessing Bolaji squeezed into a packed Toyota Space Bus headed from Ogudu to Lagos Island. As the bus cut through traffic, a conversation among passengers stirred something painful in her.

Ms Bolaji joined in, recalling the long, exhausting commutes she once endured from Ogun State to her workplace in Lekki, on Lagos Island.

The daily stress eventually forced her to relocate to Lekki Phase 1.

“I thought I was making life easier,” she said, explaining her decision to move closer to her workplace in 2024. “Instead, I walked into a nightmare.”

Her new apartment came with an invisible cost—no access to clean water. The borehole produced coloured water that looked unsafe at first glance. But with rising living costs and limited options, she began using it for bathing.

“I added Dettol to the water before bathing. I even used medicated soap, but it didn’t help,” she said.

“My skin started burning and itching, and the rashes got worse. I had to stop using the water because it felt like it was killing me.”

Soon, visits to the hospital became frequent for Ms Bolaji. She was left with no choice but to switch to using sachet water for everything possible, from bathing to cooking. It was an expensive solution, but the only one she could trust.

Across Lagos Island, in neighbourhoods like Itafaji, Onola, and Adeniji Adele, the water may look clear, but residents say it carries hidden dangers.

Behind the tap’s steady trickle lies a silent threat: bacteria, biological contaminants, and a growing public health crisis.

For many residents, the burden goes beyond finances; it strikes at their dignity and well-being. PREMIUM TIMES visited several homes across the island, where residents spoke of high rents, unreliable infrastructure, and the daily struggle to live with dignity.

Parents described the cost of bathing their children with bottled water, the discomfort of rashes that wouldn’t go away, and the heartbreak of watching their families suffer. Some, unable to afford clean alternatives, said they simply “bathe in salt” to soothe their skin.

Children in pain, mothers in despair

In a modest two-bedroom flat in Itafaji, Lagos Island, a registered nurse, Enomfon Okure, fought back tears as she recounted the toll the water has taken on her three children.

“I had to shave their heads. The boils wouldn’t stop,” she said. “My youngest would cry, saying the water ‘bites.’”

Around her, hospital cards and tubes of medicated cream told the story she didn’t need to finish. For weeks, her children couldn’t sleep through the night, kept awake by the burning itch of rashes and boils.

Desperate, Ms Okure began applying calabash chalk, a traditional remedy, on their skin. But health experts warn the substance contains dangerous heavy metals like arsenic and lead.

Though commonly used for skin problems, morning sickness, or diarrhoea, there’s no scientific evidence that calabash chalk is either effective or safe.

Still, with little government help and no affordable alternatives, many parents turn to such remedies out of desperation.

But this desperation exists in a city that, on paper, should have solutions.

“I am a nurse, and I have a good understanding that the water is not safe for my children immediately after we moved in. I started applying Nzu, also known as calabash chalk or kaolin clay, to ease the pain after I had spent money on other things,” she said.

She noted that washing underwear led to severe rashes, which she could not explain.

One afternoon, her daughter returned from school in tears. “They said she looked like she was sick because of her hair,” she noted.

Another resident, Ajoke Sodiq, a trader and mother of two, watched helplessly as her daughter developed the same symptoms.

“We tried using one special soap. It’s the only one that lathers. But it didn’t stop the pain.” Her youngest daughter once scratched behind her knee until it bled.

“She cries when they bathe. I’ve stopped using the borehole altogether, but even ‘pure water’ is sometimes dirty.”

Billions budgeted, but taps stay dry

While many residents in the upscale part of Lagos Island, like Lekki, can afford to dig private boreholes, which still produce non-potable water, many in other parts of the island are not able to.

Every morning in Itafaji, Onola, and Adeniji Adele, children wake to the same routine: a scramble for water.

Not from taps but from plastic Jerry cans filled by roadside vendors, brackish boreholes, or, in desperate moments, the filthy canals that cut through Lagos Island.

Residents of Lagos Island experience these problems because the state has failed to provide municipal, potable water for most of its residents, despite huge budgetary provisions.

Between 2019 and 2023, Lagos State approved over N16.85 billion for the Lagos State Water Corporation (LSWC), according to budget records reviewed by PREMIUM TIMES.

In 2025 alone, N7.82 billion more funds were earmarked for staff salaries, operations, and capital projects.

Another N20.62 billion was allocated to expand the Adiyan Phase II Waterworks, with N16.86 billion set aside to upgrade 15 mini and micro waterworks across the state.

However, by the end of Q1 2025, less than one per cent of these funds had been released.

“It’s all paper and promises,” said Adedayo Hammed, a retired civil servant in Itafaji. “We see water in the budget, not in our homes.”

Instead, what flows through Lagos Island is disease. In the absence of piped water, families bathe and cook with saline borehole water, or buy from vendors who charge N100–N150 per Jerry can—sometimes for water stored in unwashed containers.

“There are some areas on the island that do have water, but we have never had public water here,” Ms Sodiq said, “I pay every day for dirty water.”

“The vendors? Many don’t even clean the cans,” said Rasheed Dotun, a landlord in Itafaji. “You’re buying dirt.”

Across the Adeniji Adele Canal, the crisis is visible. Human waste flows freely into the water. During heavy rains, faeces from broken soakaways wash into the same canals where children sometimes fetch water.

Cholera, saltwater, and a city on the brink

PREMIUM TIMES reported that Lagos, Nigeria’s richest state, is geographically low-lying and partly surrounded by lagoons and the Atlantic Ocean. This makes its water table shallow and vulnerable to saltwater intrusion and sewage contamination.

These risks worsen during the rainy season from April to October, when floods overwhelm the city’s inefficient drainage systems.

In 2024, the state witnessed a deadly cholera outbreak that exposed just how broken the system is. It recorded 134 deaths from 4,667 cholera cases, a grim reflection of Lagos’s water and sanitation failures.

With Lagos Island identified as the disease’s epicentre, health authorities linked the outbreak to contaminated water sources, including unregistered tiger nut drinks and unsafe boreholes.

Among the preventable casualties was Caleb Ezechimere, a young medical laboratory scientist who died barely one month into his internship at the Military Hospital, Lagos.

“He had purchased some tiger nut drinks from a vendor, and everyone who bought from the same vendor ended up in the hospital, but he didn’t make it,” his sister-in-law, Jaachi Nwagbara, a medical doctor, recalled how Mr Ezechimere died from cholera.

“It’s a great loss. Everything reminds us of him. It was a preventable death, and that’s the most painful kind of death. Preventable deaths from infectious diseases like cholera are unacceptable in the 21st century.”

Today, with a population exceeding 24 million, Lagos continues to struggle to provide safe, affordable water.

The Lagos State Water Corporation (LWC) insists improvements are underway, but access remains elusive for large swathes of the city.

Experts say Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) is not just about infrastructure but about governance, health, and survival.

“Individual boreholes are not the solution—they’re part of the problem,” said Mekwunye Kidochukwu, a WASH expert. “Until the government fixes water and waste systems together, cholera outbreaks will continue.”

Lagos led the country in cholera infections in 2024. Kano State, officially Nigeria’s most populous, ranked 19th.

“In some places, people open septic tanks into drains that run into canals,” said Babajide Saheed, chairman of the Lagos chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association. “Then others fetch water from those same canals. Even sachet water is too expensive for many families.”

Controversial law

In a striking twist, the Lagos State government criminalised the one solution many residents rely on: unapproved boreholes.

Under the Lagos State Environmental Management Protection Law, it is illegal to drill a borehole without authorisation from the Lagos State Water Regulatory Commission (LASWARCO). Violators face a N500,000 fine, one month in prison, or both.

The UN’s Special Rapporteur on the right to water and sanitation, Léo Heller, sharply criticised the law after its passage in 2017, calling it a violation of human rights in a state where public water access had collapsed.

Mr Heller said legal measures by the government to regulate access to water are important

“However, when only 10 per cent of the population are connected to piped networks and the rest of the population rely on natural water sources for drinking water, a blanket prohibition of accessing natural water is not the way forward.”

In August 2022, LASWARCO began enforcing the law, citing sustainability. But civil society groups say the policy is disconnected from the daily reality on the ground.

“Most people here don’t even know such a law exists,” Ms Okure said. “They just want water their kids won’t fall sick from.”

“We are fighting a systemic failure with buckets and guesses. We’ve been abandoned.”

In many households, basic hygiene has become a gamble. Parents cut their children’s hair short, switch soaps, skip baths, or boil water, and they are still unsure if the water is safe.

Scientific evidence confirms danger

To understand the risks, our reporter took a borehole water sample from Lagos Island to Remaben Scientific Services Limited, a certified laboratory in Ikeja.

James Okunyi, the lab’s lead manager, confirmed the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) level exceeded 8,500 mg/litre—17 times above the WHO’s 500 mg/litre safe limit.

“This water is not just hard. It’s chemically dangerous,” Mr Okunyi said. “It shouldn’t be used for drinking, cooking, or bathing.”

The problem, he explained, isn’t just salt. It’s a mix of minerals and contaminants: chloride, sulphates, and sodium, each damaging in high concentrations.

“We see this often on the Island. Seawater seeps underground, and poorly dug boreholes pull it up,” he said. “It’s a silent health crisis.”

Long-term exposure, he added, could lead to kidney strain, hypertension, and skin damage, especially in children.

“This water strips the skin’s barrier and invites infection,” added Rena Nosy, a Lagos-based paediatrician. “Children with sensitive skin are the worst affected.”

Lagos Water Corporation defend lapses, promises relief

When PREMIUM TIMES visited the Lagos State Water Corporation (LWC) headquarters in July, the Managing Director, Mukhtaar Tijani, was unavailable for comment.

However, a senior official, Anifowoshe Olatunbosun, who represented the MD during the meeting, offered a spirited defence of the agency’s performance and explained why piped water remains a luxury in many parts of Lagos Island.

Mr Olatunbosun admitted that while some neighbourhoods still receive supply from legacy sources like the Adiyan Phase I and Iju Waterworks, the infrastructure is overstretched and inadequate for today’s demand.

He said the much-delayed Adiyan Phase II project is now 80 per cent complete and is expected to significantly boost capacity once operational.

“We have water in the system,” he said. “But people don’t know they can connect directly.”

According to him, households can obtain a connection for a N20,000 service charge, not including materials. Yet many residents bypass the Corporation entirely, relying instead on informal vendors known locally as Mairuwa, who ironically sell water sourced from LWC infrastructure at much higher retail prices.

Part of the problem, Mr Olatunbosun suggested, lies in public perception and misinformation. “There’s a general mindset that water should be free,” he said. “But potable water costs money to treat and distribute safely.”

He listed other barriers to access, including frequent damage to underground pipes during construction projects, illegal connections, tampering by residents, and a heavy reliance on boreholes.

He warned that boreholes, especially on Lagos Island, often draw saline or contaminated water due to the low-lying coastal terrain.

“We tested water from a borehole that had been stored in a household tank for six months,” he recalled. “It was unfit for consumption. But people continue using it because that’s what they’re used to.”

Mr Olatunbosun said the Corporation has ramped up sensitisation efforts in local communities and insisted that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s administration has prioritised expanding access to clean water, even at the expense of potential revenue.

“We’re not even focused on billing right now,” he said. “The goal is to make water available and safe for everyone.”

Following the PREMIUM TIMES visit, the Corporation issued a formal statement signed by Mr Tijani, the Managing Director, addressing the status of the Adiyan II Water Treatment Plant.

According to the statement, the 70 million gallons-per-day facility, under construction for several years, is now projected to be operational by the last quarter of 2027.

Estimated to cost N5 billion, the plant is expected to complement the ageing Adiyan I, which currently delivers just three million gallons daily, grossly insufficient for a state with over 20 million residents.

“On its completion, the majority of Lagos homes will have pipe-borne water,” Mr Tijani stated. “That is the target. We are looking at 2027.”

While the promise of improved water infrastructure offers a glimmer of hope, the timeline means millions of Lagosians, particularly those on the Island, will remain dependent on unsafe boreholes and expensive private vendors for at least two more years.

For families already grappling with the health fallout, especially children suffering daily from rashes, infections, and other water-related illnesses, 2027 is more than a date. It is a distant dream.

Looming Danger: Nigeria’s TB fight on life support as donors pull the plug,"When the spine leans low beneath the weight of the world, that is when the sky sends its final stone, an African adage says. Such an unexpected blow can be devastating, as it comes at a time when you are vulnerable. The impact is felt instantly. It breaks you down in that wobbly state. Recovering then becomes a crossroads of chance.

That was exactly what happened on 20 January 2025, when United States President Donald Trump issued an executive order to halt all foreign aid and disbursements, except for food assistance. Executive Order 14169 affected the Agency for International Development (USAID), the world’s leading international development agency, responsible for billions of dollars in US aid projects across the world.

In March, Marco Rubio, the US Secretary of State, announced that the Trump administration had cancelled 83 per cent of USAID’s programme. Mr Rubio said the agency had disbursed over $715 billion over the years, and now America is redirecting the funding into domestic affairs. By July, the USAID was officially shut down, and decades of global development work came to a shocking end. The ripple effect was felt across the world, especially in global health and other humanitarian efforts.

For the developing world, especially Sub-Saharan Africa, where the health sector is poorly funded by the government and healthcare infrastructure is inadequate, the announcement was the straw that broke the camel’s back. The move disrupted ongoing health initiatives, especially AIDs, tuberculosis (TB) and malaria, often referred to as ATM.

A NATION’S BURDEN

For Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, most healthcare intervention programmes are donor-funded. In 2023, Nigeria was one of the top 10 recipients of USAID funding, getting over $600 million in health grants. The agency disbursed about $2.8 billion to Nigeria’s health sector between 2022 and 2024, which has gone primarily to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria, polio, and tuberculosis.

Out of the country’s $388 million annual budget for TB, 6 per cent is domestically funded, 24 per cent is donor funded, while 70 per cent remains unfunded, with the United States contributing $22 million.

Tuberculosis is an airborne disease caused by a virulent bacterium known as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Despite being preventable and curable, TB has been identified among the top 10 causes of death worldwide. According to estimates, one missed case can transmit the infectious disease to 15 people in a year.

At the moment, Nigeria has the highest tuberculosis burden in Africa and the sixth highest globally. The disease kills 268 Nigerians every day. According to available data, the country recorded its highest-ever TB notification rate in 2024, identifying over 400,000 cases, about 79 per cent of the estimated 506,000 cases. Of over 361,000 cases reported in 2023, 9 per cent were children. Nevertheless, TB cases were under-reported, increasing the high risk of transmission.

USAID funded the Tuberculosis Local Organisations Network Project (TB-LON) across Nigeria’s high-burden states. The agency worked with local Nigerian NGOs, community-based organisations, and health facilities to expand TB services beyond hospitals into local communities.

However, the global funding cuts have disrupted the TB programmes in 18 states in Nigeria. The Global Fund office in Nigeria says the country needs $404 million to deliver TB treatment and services in 2025. Without external funding, patients are expected to cough out about $3,000 for drug-resistant TB treatment, in a country where over half of the population is multidimensionally poor and living on less than $2 daily.

In March, Ibrahim Tajudeen, executive secretary of the Global Fund Country Coordination Mechanism (CCM) in Nigeria, said the TB drugs allocated for 2025 had been used to meet the treatment demands for 2024. He disclosed that the US funding withdrawal has created a $5 million funding gap.

As soon as the executive order came into effect, health workers employed by development agencies to man clinics, especially in remote communities, withdrew their services immediately.

When The Money Stops Coming

In Osun State, south-west Nigeria, where over 250 community extension workers funded by donors immediately left the system, the public healthcare staff felt the move. Some of the primary healthcare centres with a handful or no healthcare workers were left stranded. Nurses and doctors became frustrated and exhausted as one staff member is now expected to take on the job of four.

At the State Specialist Hospital in Ashubiaro, Osogbo, the Osun State capital, the chest clinic was unusually quiet. Face contorted with anger, the middle-aged nurse in white hijab spared 53-year-old Adegboyega no words. For the past three hours, she had gently attended to tuberculosis patients who had come for their bi-weekly treatment at the clinic. As she dispensed drugs, she admonished them and offered hope.

But this time around, with just about two nurses on duty, she seemed to have exhausted her gentility as much as her strength. The thought of a patient not taking his medication at a crucial period such expensive drugs are nearing depletion irked her. Mr Adegboyega’s wife, who escorted him to the clinic, had reported him to the nurse.

“You’re wasting our efforts, and that is not good enough,” the nurse challenged him.

“We told you to stop drinking alcohol and herbal concoctions. Your tests and drugs are expensive, but you get them free. We’re helping you, but you’ve refused to help yourself.”

There was awkward silence at first. Mr Adegboyega, a commercial driver, found himself groping for words. He kept quiet for a while. Then he promised to turn a new leaf. He hopes to get better soon and resume his commercial driving job.

Abdullahi, a resident of Iwo Town and a commercial motorcyclist, wasn’t as lucky as Mr Adegboyega. Tall, dark and slim, he was in his 40s. He lived adjacent to the Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Clinic in the ancient town, where he had easy access to free treatment that could have saved his life. But he wouldn’t take his drugs. He’d branch at the clinic to collect his share of the money meant for TB patients, return to the shade of the big tree near his compound, and discuss with friends.

When Mr Abdullahi’s friends got wind of his condition, they stopped him from joining them under the tree. His wife also left him with their three children. The staff at the clinic begged him to take his medicine; neighbours would buy food for him just to encourage him. But he’d rather sit in front of his compound alone, gulp sachets of alcoholic drinks, expel tons of dry cough, while waiting to get some respite and return to ferry passengers across the town on his motorcycle.

His condition, which started as susceptible TB, became drug-resistant. When his health deteriorated, his relatives took him to their village, where he died three days later. Under the tree where Mr Abdullahi used to sit with his friends, some of whom later tested positive for TB, has now become a mobile clinic.

For Timilehin, a young petty trader in Osogbo, who had spent over N40,000 ($27) on typhoid treatment after he was misdiagnosed at a private clinic, the golden advice he got from his neighbour to visit the government hospital for a free screening was a lifesaver. He was properly diagnosed, and he has been receiving free treatment since April.

One of the state officials in charge of TB programmes, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said donors used to pay drug-resistant patients monthly for the period of free treatment to encourage them. It started from N3,000 ($2), then to N6,000 ($4), N10,000 ($7), N25,000 ($17) and later N35,000 ($23).

“They were mostly poor locals, and they complained that they didn’t have money for transport from their house to the clinic. They also complained that they didn’t have money for food because most of their family members had abandoned them for fear of infection. We also give them food just to encourage them to comply,” the official said.

“They can’t work during treatment, and they often hate themselves because of the disease. They hardly move around because of the stigma. Everyone avoids them, and they don’t want to be seen in places where they are known. The money we gave them might not be enough to feed them in a month, but it really encouraged them to buy some nutritious food and come to the clinic often.”

Grants are gone, donor-funded staff are disengaged, reagents are drying up, drugs are depleting, and financial incentives are no longer available for patients. What’s the current situation on the ground?

Case Detection Is Dropping

According to the state TB official, all the equipment used for TB was imported and paid for by donors who got their funds from the American government. The multi-million dollar equipments include digital x-ray machines, rapid diagnostic kits, GeneXpert machines, TruNat, and other radiological tools.

With the disengagement of partner staff who operated the machines and visited remote communities for house-to-house outreaches, contact tracing, and screening, cases are dropping.

The total TB cases diagnosed in Osun in 2024 were 22,031. State officials fear the figure might reduce in 2025. For instance, at the Alaye Primary Healthcare Centre in Iwo Town, the facility with the highest TB burden in the state, 612 cases were reported in the first quarter of 2025, then it dropped to 311 in the second quarter.

“We have a shortage of reporting and recording tools,” the TB official told TheCable. “The sector was already struggling with low staff. Before, there was no counterpart funding from the government for these programmes, as we solely relied on donors. Now, the government is trying to recruit more officials.”

“The workload is much, and it is not possible to cover the areas of the partners who left, which is the reason the cases dropped, as we could not detect more. We had a shortage of drugs last quarter; we got a supply in the second quarter. Due to low case detection, there are still drugs. Our data is coming down because of the funding withdrawal. We screen patients all over; now, nobody is there to screen them. So, the case will go down to zero.

“In Q3 of 2024, in Osun, there were over 7,000 cases. We were trying to bring it up when the US executive order came early this year, and it brought the number down. Q1 2025 was 4,525. We’re currently collating the numbers for Q2 2025, and we can’t tell what the present data says. It might be less.

“TB is an airborne disease. We are sitting on a keg of gun powder which can explode anytime.”

The Cost Of Neglect

In all this, there is a silent threat – patients with TB/HIV co-infection. During sensitisation programmes at the public health centres, officials describe TB and HIV as “husband and wife” – two diseases whose treatments come from donor funding. When a patient contracts HIV, their immune system is suppressed, and it cannot fight against some infectious diseases, especially TB. This co-infection leads to higher morbidity and mortality rates compared to a single infection, and it strains the healthcare system.

According to the 2021 national guidelines for the management of TB/HIV co-infection in Nigeria, HIV is known to increase the burden of TB, while TB is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV and was responsible for one-third of the estimated 690,000 deaths from HIV in 2019.

In Oyo State, 14,930 TB cases were diagnosed and treated in 2024, including 738 HIV co-infections. It was worse in 2022 when roughly 20 per cent of TB patients in the state also lived with HIV. If the drugs for TB and HIV are no longer available, that leaves the fate of patients with co-infection hanging in the balance.

The objectives of the National Strategic Plan for Tuberculosis Control 2021–2025, a policy document to end the TB epidemic in Nigeria, include strengthening the provision of integrated services for all co-infected with TB and HIV.

The budget required to implement the ambitious five-year strategy was pegged at $1,944,925,000, and the bulk of it was expected from external donors – USAID and The Global Fund. The policy document says the domestic funding for TB control in Nigeria is very low, stating that only 8 per cent of TB interventions are funded locally, while 32 per cent is funded by international donors. This leaves an existing gap of 60 per cent of the required funding for TB programmes.

One of the new strategic directions for the strategic plan is domestic resource mobilisation — in-country funding of the TB budget. The question on the lips of some stakeholders remains: What is the government doing to raise domestic funds to forestall an imminent crisis?

In May, while addressing a joint session of the National Assembly, President Bola Tinubu said no amount of foreign aid would help Nigeria unless citizens unite to build the country.

“No amount of aid from foreign countries can help us. Let us work together to build our nation, charting a new path,” the president said.

Earlier in the year, the National Assembly had approved $200 million to cater to health initiatives impacted by the US executive order.

TheCable contacted Alaba Balogun, head of press and public relations at the Federal Ministry of Health, asking questions on what the Nigerian government is doing to bridge the gap left behind by foreign donors and if domestic funding has actually been released to support ongoing health programmes. No response has been provided to date.

A senior government official at the Ministry of Health in Osun said the state government is also trying to raise over a billion naira to bridge the gap that is already becoming obvious.

“The TB programme was doing fine, and we were moving towards the point of sustainability with the help of donors. Actually, we’ve got to the level of epidemic control in TB, but if we don’t sustain the successes of the pre-Trump regime, patients will develop drug-resistant TB,” the official said.

“We may have a surge. There are some communities that are not easily accessible. We had people who could take drugs to patients at home. We had community testers, officials who stayed in these hard-to-reach areas. But they have been disengaged by partners who hired them.”

In a chat with TheCable, Happy Adedapo, Oyo State chairman of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), said the withdrawal of foreign funds portends great danger to the Nigerian healthcare system.

He said blaming a foreign country for withholding its funds is not the way out, but the government must look inwards, cut down on “frivolities and extravagance” to take care of its citizens.

“I foresee a crisis of pandemic proportions. I can tell you categorically now that there is a resurgence in the incidence of HIV/AIDs. New cases are being recorded, unlike in the past when people had access to drugs and viral loads were reduced to the barest minimum. But now, these drugs are no longer readily available. The viral loads are increasing, which aids transmission easily,” Mr Adedapo said.

“When the political elites are affected by anything, they jump up and ensure their interests are protected. Now that HIV and tuberculosis may not touch them, we have to appeal to them. We knew what happened during the COVID pandemic. They could not fly out, the foreign destinations were locked against them, and the political elites looked inwards. They raised emergency funds and set up emergency centres, and the prediction of some foreign powers that people would drop dead on African streets didn’t come to pass because of the actions some of our leaders took at that time.

“The question to now ask is: where are those emergency and infectious centres set up during the COVID period? They have become moribund. Why should we allow another pandemic to come before we start creating emergency solutions?

“There’s this saying that adversity may actually bring out the best in you. With the lack of funds from foreign donors, it should be an opportunity to strengthen our capacity. If we put so much into the system, we should expect something good.”

TB remains a major public health threat. While the world is working to end the TB epidemic by 2030 — a goal set within the Sustainable Development Goals –– funding constraints could pull a major setback, especially in underdeveloped countries.

PT Health Watch: Why teeth whitening may harm your oral health,"In a world where a dazzling smile signals confidence and beauty, teeth whitening has become increasingly popular among Nigerians, from over-the-counter strips to professional dental procedures.

But behind the gleam lies a risk, as dental experts warn that not all whitening methods are safe for oral health.

Teeth whitening is a cosmetic procedure that lightens teeth by removing stains and discolouration. According to the UK National Health Service (NHS), whitening should only be carried out safely by a dentist or other regulated dental professional, though many people turn instead to at-home products.

Most whitening treatments use bleaching agents such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, which break down stains into smaller particles to make teeth appear brighter.

But when used improperly, these chemicals can cause tooth sensitivity, gum irritation, and even permanent damage to the enamel. Also, kits sold online or used in salons do not work as well and may harm the teeth and gums.

Side effects

The American Dental Association (ADA) warns that whitening is generally safe when supervised by a dentist but can carry risks if misused.

The most common side effects include tooth sensitivity: whitening can make teeth more sensitive to hot, cold, or sweet foods; Gum irritation: bleaching agents may irritate the gums if applied improperly; and uneven whitening: dental restorations like crowns, fillings, or veneers do not whiten, leaving a patchy appearance.

The NHS further cautions against whitening treatments offered in beauty salons by unqualified staff or using unregulated online products.

Such practices, the health body said, can permanently damage teeth.

Prevalence and awareness in Nigeria

In Nigeria, cosmetic dentistry is gaining traction, especially in urban areas like Lagos and Abuja, where private dental clinics offer whitening services. However, there is limited local data on how many Nigerians undergo whitening procedures.

A study at the University of Benin showed that 35.8 per cent of undergraduates had heard of teeth bleaching, while only 17 per cent had tried it, typically via whitening toothpaste. Worryingly, under 10 per cent knew of associated risks.

In Lagos, 37.7 per cent of adolescents aged 12–16 had intrinsic tooth stains, yet over 90 per cent had never visited a dentist to manage them.

Also, among dental professionals in Ebonyi State, only 22 per cent had experience performing whitening, and 14 per cent advised against it due to side effects.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that many people turn to over-the-counter whitening kits or homemade remedies such as baking soda, charcoal toothpaste, or even lemon juice, practices that dentists warn can erode enamel and increase sensitivity.

The Nigerian Dental Association (NDA) has also repeatedly cautioned against unregulated whitening products, stressing that most are not approved by regulatory authorities such as NAFDAC.

Experts also noted that poor oral hygiene and limited access to affordable dental care contribute to tooth discolouration, pushing people toward quick-fix solutions.

According to the ADA and NHS, teeth whitening is not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women and people with untreated cavities, gum disease, or worn enamel. Also, children under 18 are generally advised against bleaching, as their teeth are still developing.

Safer alternatives and best practices

Dental professionals recommend that those considering whitening first consult a dentist to ensure it is safe and appropriate.

The ADA suggests precautions, including the use only of dentist-prescribed or ADA-approved whitening products; avoiding DIY whitening hacks involving acidic fruits, charcoal, or abrasive powders; and maintaining good oral hygiene by brushing twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, flossing, and reducing foods and drinks that stain teeth, such as coffee, tea, and red wine.

Although professional whitening performed in dental clinics tends to be more expensive, it is considered the safest option. Also, home whitening kits provided by dentists are relatively safe, as they are customised for individual needs.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/health/health-interviews/819084-pt-health-watch-why-teeth-whitening-may-harm-your-oral-health.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"YOUR HEALTH: How to manage your blood pressure and avoid stroke, By Nkechi Obianozie","Mr Ambrose was at home after a busy day at his mechanics’ workshop. He had just sat down to have his meal of Eba and Egwusi soup that Mama Favour had prepared for him when he felt his right hand was a little numb.

He quickly stretched it out and massaged his forearm thinking of the long time it took for him to unscrew the top cylinder he had worked on that day.

As he raised his arm to wash his hands in the bowl eight-year-old Favour had presented, he found himself unable to lift his hand and felt a strange sense of dizziness. That was the last he remembered.

Mr Ambrose slumped and fell off the chair sending his soup and water flying all over the floor and nearby walls. As Mama Favour screamed for help neighbours rushed into their flat to find him unconscious on the floor.

” Holy Ghost fire”, Sister Chi screamed as she saw Mr Ambrose apparently unconscious on the floor. As the crowd gathered, Mama Favour kept screaming as some administered anointing oil , others were praying and speaking in tongues while Mr Ambrose was rushed into Brother Martin’s car.

Favour and her three siblings watched on, confused while their newborn, Samuel, who was on their mothers back, started also to cry. There was a short argument about where Brother Martin was to take him. Sister Chi insisted they proceed immediately to the prayer house of her pastor where she had arranged a retinue of prayer warriors to chase the demon out of Mr Ambrose.

However, Brother Martin whose wife was a nurse insisted: “This is not a matter for Prayer House Sister Chi!” Mr Ambrose arrived at the General Hospital where he was later stabilised, his admitting blood pressure was 220/115mmHg.

The doctors immediately sent him for a scan of his brain. Mr Ambrose had had a stroke, a bleed in his brain and the doctors were scared he would not make it. As he struggled for his life for the first week, the doctors explained that he had likely been hypertensive for a long time but not diagnosed because he had signs that his body had been dealing with hypertension for long.

Mr Ambrose slowly became aware of his environment and by day seven, Mama Favour was able to explain to him all that had transpired since he collapsed while having his dinner. About one week into his hospital stay, the doctors came round for a ward, the residents gave a history summarising his case to the consultant and he heard them discussing his case.

The young doctor asked him to raise his right hand, and he struggled with no success. Even to move his fingers was an impossible task. His right arm felt like a dead weight, and same with his right leg. As tears trickled down his face, the doctors interrupted their discourse to ask Mama Favour, “why is he crying?”.

He continued to weep as he saw his future crumbling before his eyes. How would he fend for his young family without his right arm and leg. Was he to end up back in the village with his unskilled and less fortunate brothers who depended on him for their daily bread? His wife tried to explain to the doctors his fears while he continued to weep. What did he do to deserve such a fate?

The doctors tried to explain that his stroke was likely due to hypertension which he had probably had for many years without knowing. Unfortunately, Mr Ambrose had never had his blood pressure checked.

He prided himself on his good health and had rarely need to visit the local chemist in his neigbourhood. Apart from one or two yearly bouts of malaria which Emeka the chemist was quick to handle, he was mostly a healthy and strong man who never took a day off work.

Mr Ambrose is not alone, Studies show that although about one in three Nigerians are hypertensive, only 30% of them are aware of their condition with about 12% on treatment for this condition. For those on treatment, only about 3% were well controlled (Adeloye et al, PMID 33600078).

Yet hypertension is the leading cause of cardiovascular diseases like stroke, heart and kidney disease. Studies in Nigeria and Ghana have shown that majority of our risks for strokes are due to hypertension and about 91% of strokes can be prevented just by blood pressure control(SIREN study). Yet, majority of Nigerians are not even aware of their blood pressure and the need to have it checked.

Hypertension is termed a silent killer because most times it has no symptoms unless it has now led to complications like heart failure, kidney disease, or stroke.

Many Nigerians believe that headaches are a symptom of hypertension without realising that even for severely elevated blood pressure, only 20% of them will have headaches.

For the majority of people with mild to moderate hypertension, there will be NO SYMPTOMS: no headache, no dizziness, no chest pain, nothing, just silent damage

One out of four people will have a stroke during their lifetime and most of these strokes can be prevented. Strokes in Nigeria occur in younger age groups and thus tend to strike when men are still raising their families and leading to great economic burden and loss of income to the family.

Stroke has a high mortality and for those who survive, six out of 10 people live with permanent disability. Mr Ambrose was left with a permanent right sided weakness and wheelchair bound after his stroke at the age of 42. He lost his ability to provide for his family, he lost his income and most importantly stroke robbed him of his self-worth and identity as the breadwinner.

The economic burden of stroke on households, health systems and economies is significant. A study done in Ibadan in 2024 showed that total cost of stroke care in a tertiary centre in Ibadan was about N196,000.00 per patient of which 94% paid out of pocket.

This relates more to direct costs like out-of-pocket expenses for hospital admission, imaging, medication and physiotherapy.

The indirect costs however are even more alarming, loss of paid work from disability or death, cost of time and effort by family and caregivers and nonmedical costs like transportation.

Strokes also place a great burden on healthcare facilities especially in a country with limited resources like ours.

On the flip side, hypertension control is much less expensive than cost of treating stroke. Average cost of managing hypertension is about N3,400.00 monthly while the cost of acute stroke care is about N196,000.00 in direct medical costs.

This cost does not factor in the social and health care costs after the stroke event. For many, strokes can be catastrophic due to loss of income and may lead to financial ruin.

The good news is that strokes are largely preventable. Just by controlling blood pressure alone, about 91% of strokes can be prevented (SIREN study PMID).

The first step in ensuring that you are not one of the victims of stroke is to KNOW YOUR NUMBERS which a campaign is propagated by the World Hypertension Society. A healthy blood pressure is one which is less than 120/80 mmHg although the current definition of hypertension is one above 140/90 mmHg. The consensus is that for blood pressure, the lower the better.

For many who have been diagnosed with hypertension, many miss their medications, take drug holidays or are not well controlled on their blood pressure medications.

The practice of taking blood pressure medications irregularly or “I know when my BP is high, I get headache and then I take my BP medicine” should be discouraged.

Blood pressure medications should be taken regularly and at the same time of the day every day. It is also wise to have a home blood pressure monitor to check your blood pressure at least 1-2 times a week.

Once diagnosed with hypertension, regular checkups with your general practitioner should be encouraged as this will ensure that the medication is working well as sometimes the medications need to be adjusted. Many complain of the inconvenience of taking a pill every day for their blood pressure.

As I often tell my patients when they complain, “which would you prefer, taking a small pill every day or living the rest of your life in a wheelchair?”

On a broader community level, the government should conduct more screening in the population and ensure that people get their blood pressure checked at least once a year.

Government should make yearly health screening (including blood pressure assessment) compulsory for government workers, private sector, artisans and the community at large.

Majority of the population work in private sectors or are self-employed and attention should be paid to their health needs. Health clinics at every market should be compulsory and perhaps on weekly environmental days where shops are forced to close and clean their environs, blood pressure assessment can be introduced as mandatory.

Medications should also be cheap and accessible to all, possibly even free for low-income earners. All these measures will go far to reduce the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular diseases associated with hypertension.

When last did you have your blood pressure checked?

"PT Health Watch: Masturbation, Myths and Medical Facts","Masturbation is a common sexual behaviour that many people engage in, yet it remains a subject often surrounded by stigma and silence.

In this report, PREMIUM TIMES identified recent research that shed light on its prevalence, underlying reasons, and potential health implications.

Understanding its potential health implications is important for promoting accurate sexual health information, particularly among young people in Nigeria.

What Is Masturbation?

According to the Cambridge University dictionary, masturbation is the act of stimulating one’s own sexual organs to achieve sexual pleasure.

It is a natural behaviour observed across different age groups and cultures and forms part of normal sexual development.

Prevalence in Nigeria

Studies indicate that masturbation is relatively common among Nigerian adolescents and young adults.

Research conducted in 2018 found that 94 per cent of male university students and 65 per cent of female students reported engaging in masturbation.

Another study conducted in 2012 among secondary school adolescents reported that 55.7 per cent of boys and 21.9 per cent of girls had engaged in the practice.

These figures suggest that masturbation is widespread, despite social taboos that often discourage open discussion.

Masturbation and myths

Over the years, several myths have circulated about masturbation, many of which are not backed by scientific evidence.

In a report by Healthline, common misconceptions include infertility, dehydration, hormonal imbalances, changes in penis size or shape, decreased sperm count, vision loss, acne, hairy palms, erectile dysfunction, and low libido.

Some people also believe that masturbation can negatively impact romantic relationships, often suggesting it may be a sign of dissatisfaction between partners.

However, the report stressed that these claims are unfounded. While excessive masturbation may interfere with daily life or cause temporary physical discomfort, there is no evidence to suggest it leads to these conditions.

Healthline noted that masturbation is one of the safest forms of sexual activity as it carries no risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

Adding that masturbation alone or with a partner can improve their sex life and intimacy.

Masturbation and Prostate Cancer

Among the many myths, the link between masturbation and prostate cancer has attracted the most debate.

According to Healthline, there is no evidence that masturbation causes prostate cancer. On the contrary, some studies suggest the opposite may be true.

A 2016 cohort study involving 31,925 men and 18 years of follow-up found that a higher frequency of ejaculation was associated with a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.

Similarly, a review of published studies from the same year revealed that 44 per cent reported a link between frequent ejaculation and reducemxi q,o e.su9k clxd prostate cancer risk.

Still, the report cautioned that the research is not conclusive. While regular ejaculation may play a role in lowering risk, there is no evidence that it prevents advanced prostate cancer.

Health implications

The report also indicated that masturbation, when practised in moderation, is generally considered safe and it can have several health benefits, including stress reduction and improved mood.

The release of hormones such as dopamine and oxytocin during orgasm can contribute to feelings of pleasure and well-being.

Masturbation may also support sexual health by helping individuals understand their bodies and sexual responses, which can be useful for improving sexual function and satisfaction.

However, excessive masturbation can carry risks.

Physical discomfort, such as genital irritation, may occur, and in cultures where masturbation is heavily stigmatised, individuals may experience guilt, shame, or anxiety.

In extreme cases, compulsive behaviour may interfere with daily activities and responsibilities.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/health/health-interviews/817421-pt-health-watch-masturbation-myths-and-medical-facts.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Resettled But Not Recovered: Borno communities struggle for primary healthcare after return,"Across Borno State, providing accessible healthcare for resettled communities remains a work in progress. Years of conflict have devastated the health infrastructure, leaving many newly resettled residents dependent on overstretched and under-resourced Primary Health Centres (PHCs).

Aisha Ali, originally from Kalmari and now resettled in Dalori by the Borno State Government, recounts her experience at the community health facility, Litari Daloriye, which means Dalori hospital in the local Kanuri language.

Two weeks earlier, Mrs Ali had trekked several miles at dawn, carrying her young son who had been ill all night. When they finally arrived, she was told the facility could neither manage her son’s swollen bladder nor offer any medication as the hospital had run out of essential drugs.

“This is not the first time I heard such from the health personnel,” she lamented. “So, we had no other option but to use traditional medicine prepared by his father.”

She expressed her frustration over the persistent shortage of essential medicines, including basic supplies like intravenous fluids.

“Others and I always complain about this. They always say ‘it’s not available,” she said.

She also lamented a major challenge in the community: health workers often arrive late and leave early.

This, she said, leaves patients stranded during emergencies, especially at night when the only available options are to travel long distances to Maiduguri, the state capital.

“No matter how serious the emergency is, whether it’s a woman in labour or any other case, if it happens at night, the only options are to travel all the way to University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital or the General Hospital in Maiduguri, or just wait in pain till the next day,” she said.

Mrs Ali, however, acknowledged that their children do benefit from immunisation services at the facility.

“The hospital structure looks good, and water is available. But I want to call on the government to provide ‘Litari Daloriye’ with sufficient medicines and, if possible, establish more hospitals,” she said.

Kukawa’s Mixed Reality: Progress, but still gaps

Fati Bukar, who was resettled in Kukawa in 2024, said she frequently visits a nearby PHC that everyone refers to as the “dispensary.”

Mrs Bukar explained that the facility had previously struggled to operate due to security concerns, but in recent months, service delivery has improved.

“Patients, especially pregnant women, now get proper checkups. They provide immunisation, family planning services, and medicines,” she said, attributing these improvements to persistent complaints made by the resettled residents.

Mrs Bukar, however, lamented that only minor cases are handled at the ‘dispensary’ and the majority of the residents still have to travel far to Maiduguri city for serious health issues.

“My appeal is for the government to bring in more specialised health personnel and equipment, so we won’t have to be transferred out of town for every serious condition,” she said.

Demand for accountability

In Dalori, Modu Mustapha, Aisha’s husband, has little faith in the current system. He no longer visits the hospital due to repeated disappointments.

Mr Mustapha said the same type of medicine is administered to patients regardless of their differing ailments, which he believes is inappropriate

“One thing that troubles me is how they give the same type of medicine to patients with different illnesses. I’m not a doctor, but I know that’s not right,” he said.

He urged the government to address the situation by ensuring regular drug supply, employing more healthcare workers and strengthening the quality of medical checkups.

Similarly, Mr Abubakar, husband to Fati, said the PHC in Baga, Kukawa LGA, is the only functional facility he is aware of.

He noted that the facility is equipped to handle basic emergencies, and he often takes his family there when urgent care is needed.

However, he highlighted two major challenges: the occasional unavailability of medicines and the long distances people have to walk to get to the facility.

“Sometimes, the hospital gets overcrowded, and the work becomes overwhelming because it’s the only functioning health centre. The government should consider building more health facilities,” he said.

Ibrahim Kaujima, who also resettled in Kukawa in 2024, shared his experience with this reporter.

“Just three days ago, I took my mother to the hospital, and she was well taken care of. They even gave us free medicines. For cases beyond their capacity, they refer patients to Maiduguri or Monguno LGA.”

Mr Kaujima, however, noted that transportation becomes a challenge after 3 p.m. due to bad roads and security threats.

“More hospitals need to be built so that people don’t have to suffer unnecessarily. I call on both the government and NGOs to look into this matter,” he said.

The pressure on healthcare services is intensified by Borno’s large internally displaced population. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the state hosts over 877,000 IDPs – 77 per cent of Nigeria’s total, causing the demand for care to continue rising.

Health workers on the ground

Waziri Bura, who works in one of the Kukawa PHCs, said four PHCs are currently active: Doron Baga PHC, Baga PHC, SSC Cross Kauwa, and a clinic in Kukawa.

Mr Bura said the PHCs provide services such as child delivery, antenatal care, and immunisation. Of the workforce, 40 per cent are female and 60 per cent are male, including volunteers, he said.

According to him, ward development committee officials regularly visit the facilities due to the growing IDP population in the town.

He also noted that ambulances are available to transport patients to Maiduguri when cases go beyond their capacity, particularly during childbirth or surgical emergencies. He highlighted some progress, including improved malaria treatment and the availability of HIV medication.

However, insecurity remains a significant challenge. Referrals at night are difficult due to fears of attacks and explosions. He believes resolving the security issues would lead to substantial improvements in healthcare delivery.

Bashir Sandiya, the senior special assistant on Media and Publicity to the Chairman of Konduga LGA, Abba Abbari, spoke on the council’s efforts to improve access to healthcare across communities under its jurisdiction, including Dalori.

Mr Sandiya stated that 30 functional PHCs under their supervision now receive medicines and ambulances. “Recently, Auno PHC received an ambulance after a needs assessment,” he said.

“In every community, we rely on councillors to share pressing issues before we take action. Regarding Dalori, I believe Ali Mairamme, the councillor, is unaware of the situation; otherwise, he would have forwarded it.”

He assured that now that the issue has been raised, the council would investigate and determine whether the situation could be addressed at the chairman’s level, the primary health care board, or the state level.

He urged residents to channel complaints to their community leaders and encouraged parents to take advantage of available immunisation services.

Beyond local efforts, the Borno State Contributory Healthcare Management Agency (BOSCHMA) has enrolled over 115,000 vulnerable individuals in free healthcare programmes since 2020. Services are provided through 183 accredited PHCs, a promising step toward inclusivity.

State-Level Perspective: Director weighs in

The Director of Community and Family Health Services at the Borno State Primary Healthcare Development Board, Mala Abdulwahab, provided a broader view of the state’s health sector recovery.

Mr Abdulwahab explained that prior to the insurgency, Borno State had at least 700 PHCs, but the crisis reduced that number to about 100.

In response, the government initiated construction and rehabilitation efforts, bringing the number of functional PHCs to over 400, including facilities in resettled communities.

He explained that resettled populations fall into two categories: those in rebuilt homes and those in temporary camps. “People in homes usually have centres nearby. For camps, we deploy outreach teams every Friday to provide basic services.”

He said insecurity remains a major challenge, but the collaboration with military personnel and civilian joint task force members helps PHC operations continue. “Even in conflict areas, services are ongoing because healthcare is a necessity.”

On Kukawa’s request for more health centres, he said it would be considered, but urged residents to appreciate current efforts. As for Dalori’s complaints, he stressed that the hospital is functional and serving its purpose.

“People need to understand what primary healthcare means. It’s the first point of contact, providing basic and nearby emergency care. Some limitations like drug shortages or the need for referrals shouldn’t be mistaken as failure,’ he said.

“The situation is overwhelming, and the government is doing its best.”

He credited national and international partners for bolstering healthcare delivery in the state.

Highlighting successes, Mr Abdulwahab noted that 2025 has so far recorded no major outbreaks of cholera, whooping cough, or measles—a significant improvement.

“Before, insecurity prevented us from reaching 15 LGAs. Now, most are accessible, which also encourages humanitarian groups to assist.”

A functional PHC benefits all

Functional primary healthcare centres are the backbone of Nigeria’s health system, especially in fragile and conflict-affected settings like Borno State.

They serve as the first point of contact for preventive, promotive, and basic curative services — including maternal care, immunisation, and disease surveillance. Without accessible and well-staffed PHCs, efforts to reduce health inequities and reach vulnerable populations stall.

A 2022 report titled “The State of Primary Healthcare Service Delivery in Nigeria” shows that Borno and 17 other Nigerian states are weak in PHC service delivery.

The other states are Sokoto, Taraba, Kebbi, Katsina, Zamfara, Yobe, Kogi, Jigawa, Rivers, Gombe, Cross River, Edo, Bayelsa, Akwa-Ibom, Plateau, Imo, and Kaduna.

Findings from the report also blame Nigeria’s deteriorating healthcare system on the weak governance structures and operational inefficiencies.

For resettled communities in Borno, access to healthcare is no longer just about infrastructure. It’s about trust, consistent availability, and safety.

While improvements have taken root, true recovery will mean building a system that can be relied upon—day or night, crisis or calm.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nnorth-east/818750-resettled-but-not-recovered-borno-communities-struggle-for-primary-healthcare-after-return.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
Silent Struggles: Nigerian women turn to contraceptives to ease menstrual distress,"Every month, Bolanle Oyebamji was tormented by her menstrual cycle—waves of pain from her lower back, down her legs, and through a swollen, throbbing pelvis.

For the recent graduate of Ekiti State University, periods were more than a biological occurrence; they were a disruptive force that derails daily life.

That was until a friend suggested she try Postpill, a contraceptive pill, not for its primary purpose of preventing pregnancy, but for her debilitating cramps.

The outcome was unexpected. Her period became irregular, with a seven-day break before returning with heavier force. Fortunately, the heavy flow came with no menstrual cramps.

“After that, I didn’t see my period for two months, and that got me worried. That was my first time using the drug, and I had no choice but to consult a doctor,” she said.

“I felt a lot of dizziness and headaches when I used the drug, and that affected my academics and daily activities for some days.”

Ms Oyebamji went for a diagnosis and learned she had a ‘simple ovarian cyst.’

Ovarian cysts are found around the pelvic area in premenopausal women. They occur when there is a persistent change in the menstrual cycle. According to the Cleveland Clinic, an online medical report, recurrent infections can cause ovarian cysts.

For Ms Oyebamji, the diagnosis was both a relief and a concern, knowing it wasn’t something more severe but still needed proper treatment.

She was placed on a drip for three days and was administered a metro infusion and normal saline along with drugs like doxycycline, flagyl, and cefuroxime.

Ms Oyebamji’s experience mirrors a growing trend among Nigerian women who are turning to hormonal contraceptives, originally manufactured to prevent pregnancy, to suppress or regulate menstruation.

For some, it’s a last resort to regain control over their lives. For others, it’s a risky gamble, often taken without medical guidance, in a society where both menstrual disorders and contraception remain heavily stigmatised.

Contraceptive usage patterns among Nigerian women

Contraceptive pills, also known as birth control pills, are oral contraceptives that use hormones to prevent pregnancy at a 99 per cent effective rate when used as prescribed.

In Nigeria, contraceptive use among women of reproductive age (15–49 years) remains relatively low, with 31 per cent having either previously used a contraceptive or currently using one, while 12.2 per cent are currently using modern methods.

According to the National Institute of Health, contraceptives can be used to manipulate or shorten menstrual flow, but this practice comes with potential health risks and implications.

Some women use birth control pills, patches, rings, or injections to skip periods or make them lighter and less frequent. This is sometimes called ‘menstrual suppression’ or ‘period manipulation.’

The report added that common methods used for this purpose are combined hormonal contraceptives containing estrogen and progesterone. They work by preventing ovulation and thinning the uterine lining, which leads to lighter, shorter, or no periods.

The effectiveness and satisfaction rates of these methods vary based on the type of contraceptive used and individual experiences.

Hormonal Intrauterine Devices (IUDs) are notably effective for menstrual suppression. Studies indicate that after one year of use, approximately 20 per cent to 50 per cent of women experience amenorrhea (complete cessation of menstruation).

Though another method, Progestin-Only Pills (Mini-Pills), can aid in menstrual suppression, they often lead to irregular bleeding patterns. Up to 70 per cent of users report breakthrough bleeding, and one-third to one-half experience prolonged periods.

A study conducted in a secondary health facility in Kebbi State revealed that among women who used contraceptives, 87.5 per cent reported satisfaction with their chosen method.

However, many women who use contraceptives also express dissatisfaction, primarily due to side effects, complexity of use, or concerns about reliability.

Despite their potential benefits, various factors limit the widespread use of contraceptives for menstrual suppression in Nigeria. Many women remain wary of possible side effects, including weight gain, irregular bleeding, and concerns about long-term fertility.

These fears—often fueled by misinformation or lack of proper medical guidance—discourage women from exploring contraceptives as a solution to menstrual challenges.

In some communities, contraceptive use is still considered taboo or seen as contrary to religious beliefs. These perceptions can significantly influence women’s decisions, especially in patriarchal households where the husband’s opinion takes precedence.

In such settings, a woman’s autonomy over her reproductive health may be restricted, even when faced with debilitating menstrual symptoms.

The Personal Toll: Ayobami’s story

Ayobami*, 26, worked as a food attendant at a hotel, where her daily routine was demanding and physically draining. But each month, her period represented a battle—one that cost her more than just physical comfort.

Her symptoms were extreme: a swollen vagina, aching legs, splitting headaches, overwhelming fatigue, restlessness, and frequent vomiting. These episodes left her barely able to get out of bed, let alone commute to work.

“There are times I find it hard to get out of bed, let alone make it to work, which is about 30-minute journey from my home, and that causes me to miss workdays every month,” she explained.

Over time, her repeated absences strained her relationship with her employer, who grew less tolerant with each episode. “He usually views my absences as a lack of commitment rather than a battle of forces of nature. I can’t explain in full detail my plight,” she said.

Eventually, Ayobami lost her job.

The dismissal came as a devastating blow. Even worse was the feeling of helplessness—despite trying different medications, her pain persisted, her cycle remained unpredictable, and her quality of life declined.

“I had tried several pain relief drugs, from Felvin to diclofenac and paracetamol, and they have only made my periods fluctuate unpredictably.” All the drugs offered little to no relief. In desperation, Ayobami turned to contraceptive pills, hoping they might offer the relief traditional painkillers failed to provide.

While most women find that using contraceptives in this way is generally safe, studies prove that there are potential adverse effects, including irregular spotting, breakthrough bleeding, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, and mood changes.

Some are also concerned that suppressing long-term menstruation could mask underlying conditions like endometriosis or uterine fibroids.

A gynaecologist, Unimke Agim, said hormonal contraceptives prescribed by a gynaecologist to treat women with diagnosed menstrual disorders have similar side effects when used for contraceptive purposes.

Mr Agim added that the side effects can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abnormal menstrual bleeding, mood changes, headaches, migraines, breast tenderness and enlargement, and weight gain, among others.

“For those diagnosed with menstrual abnormalities by a gynaecologist, the use of hormonal contraceptives prescribed to them is effective in regulating and inducing menstruation,” he said.

“Also, access to menstrual health can be limited by several factors, such as finance, religion, and the unavailability of gynaecologists.”

He stated that apart from the use of contraception to space childbirth and give the woman time to return to her baseline state before another pregnancy fully, other situations where contraceptives can be used include patients with endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome.

Other cases are patients undergoing treatment for cancer, and patients with renal disease, where pregnancy is contraindicated.

However, he cautioned that contraceptives should not be used without consulting a doctor, as they can interact with certain medications and have higher failure rates in some cases.

Prevalence of dysmenorrhea

Menstrual pain, also known as dysmenorrhea, is a widespread condition with serious implications for women’s daily lives. In Nigeria, studies show that 70 per cent of adolescent girls and women of reproductive age experience dysmenorrhea, and it is a leading cause of absenteeism.

An online research conducted at a private university revealed that 69.8 per cent of female students suffered from menstrual pain, with 54.5 per cent rating it as moderate and 4.7 per cent experiencing it as severe.

The consequences of this pain go far beyond discomfort. In the same studies, 50.2 per cent reported that the pain disrupted their normal work, 44.8 per cent withdrew socially, and 38.8 per cent struggled to sleep.

Another study emphasised the importance of addressing physical aspects like poor access to water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities, lack of privacy, and inadequate menstrual materials, as well as psychosocial factors related to cultural taboos and stigmas surrounding menstruation, which can lead to embarrassment, stress, and reduced confidence among girls in school.

Elaborating on the causes of menstrual disorders, Idoko Sunday, a reproductive health expert, noted that some causes of irregular menstrual flow include submucous fibroids, which are associated with heavy menstrual flow or bleeding, and endometriosis.

Mr Sunday explained that Combined Oral Contraceptive (COC) pills, implants, and devices inserted in the uterus prevent ovulation and menstruation, and if a woman doesn’t menstruate, then she won’t feel any pain associated with menstrual cramps.

“There are lots of medications that can be used to correct problems associated with menstruation irregularities. Contraceptive devices, including pills containing estrogen and progesterone, can regulate menstrual cycles and reduce pain,” he added.

More cases

Just like Ms Oyebamji, Oluwanifemi, a 25-year-old serving corps member, shared her experience with PREMIUM TIMES. While in camp, she began to notice light spotting a week earlier than expected, attributing it to stress.

Oblivious at first, she only became aware of the spotting when a fellow camp member pointed out the stains on her clothes. Surprised, Ms Oluwanifemi realised the bleeding was real, though she initially thought she was imagining it, feeling just a slight slipperiness.

“The little spotting went on for four days, and it was then that I knew I needed to see a doctor. Before then, I thought it was because the flow was coming in early, but it didn’t show up as a full menstrual flow.”

By the end of camp, Ms Oluwanifemi’s bleeding intensified and persisted all day, stretching over 10 days. Concerned, she went to the hospital, where doctors diagnosed her with a hormonal imbalance. They prescribed a five-day medication to halt the bleeding and planned additional treatment once it stopped.

“The drugs were expensive. I used the drugs, but the bleeding didn’t stop; it was more blood I was seeing. It was more like the drugs increased the volume of blood. It was already 20 days into the bleeding, nonstop.

“After I finished the drugs, it had been over 20 days already, and I went back to the hospital. I did a scan, and they realised it was polyps.”

She explained that the bleeding was the only symptom of the infection, which is around her uterus lining, and required surgery for its removal.

“By the time I had the surgery, I was already 30 days into the bleeding. After the surgery, I had only a little bleeding, and since then, my menstrual flow has become normal,” she added.

Cervical Cancer risk

Speaking on the effects of using contraceptives for menstrual purposes, Mr Agim, the gynaecologist, noted that combined oral hormonal contraceptives have been linked to the risk of cervical cancer when used for longer periods, but also have some protective effects against ovarian cancer.

He advised that both government and non-governmental organisations in the field of reproductive medicine should educate and create awareness about menstrual disorders, their implications, and how to get help.

“Sex education should be introduced in schools, and menstruation and menstrual disorders should be emphasised. This will help women with such problems seek healthcare on time without letting it affect their socio-economic lives.”

Just like Mses Oyebamjia and Oluwanifemi, and countless other Nigerian women, the search for relief from debilitating menstrual symptoms often leads down a complicated, and sometimes risky, path.

Whether it’s turning to contraceptives out of desperation or enduring prolonged bleeding and pain in silence, many women are simply trying to reclaim their bodies and their lives.

Yet, in a country where menstrual health is still wrapped in stigma and misinformation, and where access to accurate information and professional care remains a privilege, not a right.

Until there is widespread education, accessible reproductive healthcare, and a shift in societal attitudes, women will continue to navigate this struggle largely alone—resorting to whatever means they can to find comfort in a system that too often ignores their pain.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/817615-silent-struggles-nigerian-women-turn-to-contraceptives-to-ease-menstrual-distress.html,https://premiumtimesng.com
"How stigma, cultural taboos deepen Nigeria’s menstrual health crisis – Expert","Menstrual health remains one of Nigeria’s most pressing yet under-discussed public health challenges, with millions of women and girls struggling to access safe products, accurate information, and supportive environments.

In this exclusive interview with PREMIUM TIMES, Abdulhameed Adediran, Team Lead for Menstrual Health Initiatives at Population Services International (PSI) Nigeria, shares insights into the current state of menstrual health, the barriers caused by stigma and cultural taboos, and the role of policy in shaping a more inclusive future for women and girls.

PT: How would you describe the current state of menstrual health in Nigeria?

Adediran: I’d describe the current state of menstrual health in Nigeria as burdened. This is because in the past, there have been concerted efforts amongst stakeholders to improve on what used to be a more deplorable situation. I will look at this through three lenses of demand, supply and enabling environment.

In terms of demand, I will look at the comprehensive education. Until recently, Nigeria did not have a structured document that clearly outlined messaging, communication, education, and behavioural change strategies around menstrual health and hygiene.

This meant that for years, women and girls relied on fragmented information and rumours about how to manage their menstrual period. This includes how to dispose of the products, appropriately use their sanitary products and what to do when they encounter certain challenges during their menstrual period. So, this information was not available until recently.

In terms of access, we know that almost 100 per cent of disposable pads, which are commonly available in Nigeria, are imported. What this means is that, the price of the monthly commodity is left at the mercy of foreign exchange. As we know, foreign exchange is unfavourable and it directly impacts what is meant to be a basic need of every woman.

Even in terms of access, the distribution channel is restricted because not everyone feels comfortable stocking or distributing menstrual products, especially in rural areas. When that happens, women and girls opt for different options, usually unsanitary products that are used for sanitary services during their menstrual periods.

This is quite deplorable, and the experience we found in the field is worse than we thought. We’ve had reports of girls who use dry leaves, cow dung and their socks in place of pads.

That said, I like to describe the situation as both half-full and half-empty. With the concerted efforts of PSI, the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development, and other partners, progress is being made. If we sustain these strategies, we believe improvements will come faster than expected.

PT: What are the most common challenges women and girls face in accessing menstrual products and information?

Adediran: The challenges cut across sections of social, cultural and economic lines. We observed that there is an economic stratification in access to products and services, including information. An instance of this is a girl in an urban area who has access to sophisticated, latest smartphones and can download different apps to monitor her flow, and if she is in pain, she can ask questions online amongst others.

Direct health services are more accessible to those of the high economic stratum than those of low socioeconomic status. What this means is that those in the rural areas have fewer opportunities for services and information.

As mentioned earlier, the common forms of menstrual products are disposable products which are not manufactured in Nigeria. This means that the rich have access to the high-end products by travelling abroad to get the best quality product to use for the whole year, until the next time they get to travel. While the poor do not even get the available basic option mainly because they either cannot afford it or it’s a luxury to them. Distribution is also limited, especially in rural communities where local vendors may not prioritise stocking these products.

For social reasons, we noticed that knowledge about menstrual health is just passed on from generation to generation. This means that the myths go along with whatever the right information is, as there is no way to verify what is right or wrong.

For the cultural aspect, we are in a very deep cultural country, so a lot of the cultures are passed from generation to generation and just end up being adopted and then passed on again. For instance, we had a social experiment where we asked a group of experts, doctors, and educationists how to dispose of menstrual products and the house was divided.

Some said you have to burn it, some said you have to wash it thoroughly, while others said you have to flush it. All these are going on because there is practically no structured way to dispose of these products, so it just becomes a culture of people going with trends.

PT: How do myths, stigma, and cultural taboos influence menstrual health practices and attitudes in Nigeria?

Adediran: During our trainings, we try to ask “What do you call menstruation in your culture”, and you could see the diversity in what menstruation is called, because nobody wants to come out straight and say, it is menstruation. That is the fundamental basis for the various stigmas that are associated with it.

Our culture gives the impression that it’s okay to say you have a headache or malaria, but it’s almost a taboo to say I’m on my period. If this is being passed from one generation to another, it becomes a norm and everybody thinks it’s okay not to disclose any information about one’s period. This means one thing; that girl will not be able to access the right services and products.

For instance, a girl goes to the supermarket but feels uncomfortable buying pads because she doesn’t want people to know she is menstruating, despite being a woman. Also, a girl doesn’t want to hold an extra pad when going out just to make sure nobody knows she is on her period and so on.

All of these put together affect the quality of life Nigerian women live during their menstrual period and the quality of the menstrual products and services they can access.

PT: What role can schools, workplaces, and community leaders play in improving menstrual health access and awareness?

Adediran: To be honest, since we got ourselves to where we are it is our responsibility to also take us out of where we are. We have spoken extensively about how our socio-cultural environment has impacted menstrual health. So, it means that for us to work it back, we also need to adopt the same strategy.

How can we do this? By getting each one to tell the other. It’s easier for people in the community to influence other people and say, We have agreed as a community that this is no longer the norm. And before you know it, it starts spreading out.

And when we talk about community, it varies. For instance, for us at PSI, we are building a group of people that we call the Menstrual Health Champions, and they cut across the different strata and layers of our society.

We also have them in the community, those we call the Community Menstrual Health Champions. These are influential within the community, like opinion, religious and cultural leaders within the community. We count on them to gradually, through various dialogue sessions, begin to change the narrative.

At the schools, because we know that teachers have a huge influence on what the girls become or believe in, we are also empowering them to pass down this knowledge.

We also have the Media Champions because a lot of people consume so much information from the media. Hence, we decided to infuse menstrual health into it and get them to pass this information so that, gradually we might begin to change the narrative and trend of menstrual health. We believe there is a tremendous role that individuals and communities can play when it comes to reversing the trend in the menstrual health challenges we face in Nigeria.

PT: Can you tell us about the menstrual health initiative by PSI?

Adediran: In PSI Nigeria, we have several projects cutting across reproductive health and other non-communicable diseases. Menstrual Health-No Wahala (MH-NoW) is a project that aims to improve the menstrual health of adolescent girls and young women between the ages of 10-24 in Nigeria, specifically in the six states of; Akwa-Ibom, Bauchi, Kano, Lagos, Nasarawa and Sokoto.

Most recently, further to this project we received a grant to provide menstrual and economic empowerment to women in Plateau state. What we do is intersect between improving access to menstrual health services and products and improving access to comprehensive information and education to address stigmas and taboos associated with menstrual health.

PT: Are there any successful menstrual health initiatives in Nigeria that could serve as models for wider adoption?

Adediran: If the monthly report received from the field is anything to go by, then I’d say the PSI menstrual health initiative is already a success. So far, we have a set of over 300 menstrual health champions and in three months, we have been able to reach over 200,000 people with menstrual health information and education.

We have also identified producers of reusable products within each state, and still using our network of champions, we have been able to identify a chain of distribution of these products. So far, we are still counting the number of pads being sold daily to adolescent girls and young women.

Again, if we can do this successfully in three LGAs each in six states, then we believe that this can always be replicated. Most importantly, there are cross-cutting efforts around creating an enabling environment for menstrual health.

We have been able to support the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development to develop the very first National Policy on Menstrual Health and Hygiene Management in Nigeria, and we believe that, if this can be adopted in all states, it can help improve menstrual health.

We have also carried out smart advocacy training in PSI implementing states, and we are happy to scale it down to other states and provide resource materials. The training materials and behavioural change communication materials that we have developed are also available and have been adopted at the National level.

What this means is that anybody from Nigeria can pick these materials and use them to provide structured information, education and communication on menstrual health. So yes, these are models that have been tried and can be replicated in otherer states across the country.

PT: What are the biggest gaps in government or policy efforts to address menstrual health, and how can they be filled?

Adediran: I’d say generally, it is prioritisation. You’d observe that a lot of times, government priorities differ. Among government priorities, there is women health which mostly doesn’t rank very high even when discussing women matters. A lot of times when you talk about the needs of women, everybody talks about empowerment, distributing wrappers, grinding machines, bag of rice and others.

But beyond that, there are certain things that are fundamental to the livelihood of these women like the reproductive health. Even in discussing other issues of women’s health, the place of menstrual health so far has been found to be quite low which is not helpful.

I feel that a milestone in the recent validation of the policy on Menstrual Health and Hygiene Management is the big statement that the government is beginning to look in the direction of menstrual health.

Yes, the gaps are there. We have a particular state where there is even a budget line on menstrual health and for some reasons, the funds will not just be released because the person responsible doesn’t consider menstrual health a priority.

So, if we are able to put this policy into action, the budget is created, the funds are allocated and judiciously used, then the story of menstrual health in Nigeria will change for the better.

PT: What future steps or innovations would you recommend to improve menstrual health and reduce period poverty across the country?

Adediran: First, is that everyone should know that menstrual health is everybody’s business. Knowing this will make everyone identify their role and once this is known, they take up the responsibility and discharge. The impressive discovery I also have about menstrual health is the multi sectoral nature of it. That is why the concept of Technical Working Group has worked effectively at the national level, and we are promoting it at the sub-national level as well in our implementing states.

For instance, we have different roles for the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs, Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Ministry of Education, Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON), National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) etc. Even at the sub-national level, this is how it is.

So, if we all can see that menstrual health first is human right, and secondly its everybody’s business then we’d have gone a long way to improve the health and wellbeing of our girls and women.",https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/816235-how-stigma-cultural-taboos-deepen-nigerias-menstrual-health-crisis-expert.html,https://premiumtimesng.com

AUN/PREMIUM TIMES DATA HUB,"The past five years have shown us how fragile democracy can be, not only in Nigeria but around the world. We have witnessed the deterioration of democracy in established democracies, like the United States. Democratic norms are faltering as autocratic leaders and politicians with subversive intentions have found ways to use mainstream and social media to control cognitive outcomes through disinformation and manipulation.

Democracy presupposes the existence of an educated electorate, who are able to evaluate information. Indeed democracy thrives when there is a well-informed and engaged citizenry. However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.

The AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism. The Development Hub will use data and analysis to build an evidence base for change.

The purpose of this Hub is to present data and analysis and a platform for discussion on every major sphere of development, including gender, poverty, education, health, economic growth and employment, governance and democracy, peace and security and the role of technology. On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria’s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.

Our goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers. We hope to build an evidence base for positive economic, social and political change.

FirstBank Wins Appeal In Landmark Case Against Nduka Obaigbena’s General Hydrocarbons Ltd,"First Bank of Nigeria Limited (FirstBank) has secured a significant victory at the Court of Appeal , its case against General Hydrocarbons Limited (GHL) filed by their lawyers Babajide Koku SAN and Victor Ogude SAN

Advertisement

In its judgment, the Court of Appeal at the instance of GHL to hear FBN’s appeal on an urgent basis during the Court’s vacation after hearing the appeal , on Thursday the 11 September 2025 set aside the earlier decision of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt, Obile J which had earlier dismissed FirstBank’s claims regarding the fraudulent diversion of proceeds from the sale of crude oil cargo pledged as collateral for loan facilities.

The dispute arose from crude oil aboard the FPSO Tamara Tokoni, which GHL had pledged to FirstBank as security for substantial loan facilities. Contrary to the terms of the pledge, GHL diverted the proceeds from the sale of the cargo, prompting the Bank to seek legal redress.

FirstBank filed an appeal challenging the trial court’s decision that had treated the matter as a simple debt recovery. The Court of Appeal, in its ruling, affirmed the maritime nature of the claim and emphasised the importance of preserving the Res, the crude oil cargo, as the central issue in dispute. The Court set aside the earlier order of the trial court vacating the order of arrest of 2nd respondent.

The appellate court allowed FirstBank’s appeal and set aside the Federal High Court’s ruling. It authorised the sale of the crude oil cargo aboard FPSO Tamara Tokoni, with the proceeds to be deposited into an interest-yielding escrow account under the custody of the Chief Registrar of the Court of Appeal, pending the hearing and determination of the case at the trial court and the court of arbitration. The Chief Registrar was also appointed to take possession of the cargo and ensure its protection against dissipation or unauthorised disposition by any party.

This ruling marks a significant milestone for FirstBank and reinforces the Bank’s commitment to upholding the integrity of financial transactions and protecting the interests of its stakeholders.

FirstBank remains steadfast in its dedication to sound corporate governance, legal compliance, and the protection of its assets. The judgement of the Court of Appeal sets a strong precedent for the enforcement of collateral agreements and accountability in high-value commercial transactions.",https://leadership.ng/firstbank-wins-appeal-in-landmark-case-against-nduka-obaigbenas-general-hydrocarbons-ltd/,https://leadership.ng
"New Tax Act: Fresh Airfare Hike Looms Over Levies On Aircraft, Tickets, Others","Airfares in Nigeria are set to rise further from January 1, 2026, when the new Tax Act, which imposes import duties and Value Added Tax (VAT) on aircraft, aircraft parts and airline tickets, becomes operational.

Advertisement

The Act stipulates that local airlines will begin paying import duties and VAT on commercial aircraft imports, commercial aircraft engines, spare parts, and air tickets.

Industry stakeholders warn that these new levies will increase airlines’ operational costs, a burden likely to be passed on to passengers through higher ticket prices.

The new tax reform Act, published by the federal government in an official gazette, among other provisions, also allows taxpayers to settle levies arising from foreign currency transactions in naira using the prevailing exchange rate in the official foreign exchange market.

LEADERSHIP Friday reports that the new Tax Reforms Act would come into effect in 2026, and Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) had warned it would collapse the nation’s aviation sector.

AON vice president Dr Allen Onyema said that if implemented, the Tax Reform Act will collapse local airline businesses in 48 hours.

According to him, Nigerian airlines are already overtaxed and adding additional taxes will cause the industry to collapse.

“I don’t know who put the clause in the tax reform that airlines should start paying Customs duty and 7.5 per cent Value Added Tax (VAT) on imported aircraft, spare parts and even airfares,” Onyema said.

However, speaking on Thursday at a Business Webinar jointly organised by Aviation & Allied Business in collaboration with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), with the theme: ‘Nigeria Tax Act (2025) & The Aviation Industry: Aviation Sector Enlightenment Initiative,’ the federal government declared that there is no going back on the full implementation of the new Tax Reforms Act from January 1, 2026

In her presentation, the assistant director of the Nigeria Revenue Service (formerly FIRS), Nkechi Umegakwe, said that the government had done all due diligence before developing the new tax laws.

Umegakwe, the lead presenter at the event, insisted that airline operators, including other allied businesses in the aviation sector, must now pay VAT on all of their services and operations.

Currently, airlines are exempt from paying import duties and VAT on the importation of commercial aircraft, commercial aircraft engines, spare parts, and air tickets.

She insisted that all the above are now liable to VAT from January 1, 2026.

According to her, the new tax reforms were geared towards increased revenue generation for the federal government, business cost reduction via VAT recovery, improved cash flow for businesses, and stronger compliance via digital invoicing and tracking.

Umegakwe expressed that the new tax reforms have harmonised various taxes to create a unified system that eliminates inconsistencies and drives efficiency while simplifying the current tax laws.

She said, “VAT is a consumption tax on goods and services to be borne by the end users and not the suppliers. Once the new tax reforms become operational, you must pay VAT on whatever you bring in as an airline – aircraft, engines, spare parts, and others.

“However, if the taxes are in essence, the airlines can ask for a refund, which would be done within 30 days of request. But, with the new tax reforms, airlines will no longer be exempt from VAT payment.”

New taxes in breach of international treaties

The area manager, West and Central Africa, IATA, Dr. Samson Fatokun, in his contribution as a panel member, criticised the government for inconsistencies.

In his presentation, Fatokun said that the airlines and other operators in the sector were already overburdened with numerous levies and charges, and he wondered why the government was bent on adding to the current challenges in the sector.

Fatokun mentioned the payment of a five per cent Ticket Sales Charge/Cargo Sales Charge (TSC/CSC) by the airlines as one of the levies they were currently battling.

He maintained that the five per cent TSC/CSC inflated the price of air tickets and scared away some potential air passengers from the sector.

He recalled that President Bola Tinubu had, in December 2024, as the chairman of ECOWAS, signed a treaty with other member nations, which prohibited taxes on air passengers and cargo.

The new treaty would take effect from January 1, 2026.

Apart from this, he also said that Nigeria, as “a full member” of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), signed a treaty which prohibited payment of VAT on air transportation, reiterating that the aviation industry is cost recovery, not revenue generation.

“Aviation is a global business; there are treaties signed to regulate the global industry. Nigeria, as a member of ICAO, is subject to the recommendations and regulations of the organisation.

“The Nigerian tax authority needs to be aware of international treaties Nigeria entered into with various countries. As it is, we are contravening the treaties we already entered into with the return of VAT for airlines,” he said.

Also speaking, aviation expert, Capt. Samuel Caulcrik said that the various taxes and levies in the sector were already choking the operators and slowing down the growth of the business.

He argued that the payment of 7.5 per cent VAT and TSC/CSC by the airlines would amount to multiple taxation on the industry and called on the government to rescind its decision.

Caulcrik further posited that all the money being spent on the sector comes from air passengers and shippers, noting that any additional tax would kill the industry.

He added: “This will cut down the number of air travellers coming into the industry. If some of the passengers had been cut off due to five per cent TSC/CSC, an additional 7.5 per cent from VAT will chase away more people from the industry and deplete performance.”

On her part, the managing director of Pathfinder Securities, Nkechi Onyenso, canvassed further engagements by the federal government and aviation business stakeholders.

According to her, the paucity of foreign exchange, multiple taxation, and other levies generally negatively impact the aviation industry.

She, however, said that the new Tax Reforms Act has its own advantages, but insisted there is room for more engagement.

Signed into law on June 26, 2025, the reforms are contained in four legislations: the Nigeria Tax Act, 2025 (NTA); Nigeria Tax Administration Act, 2025 (NTAA); Nigeria Revenue Service (Establishment) Act, 2025 (NRSEA) and Joint Revenue Board (Establishment) Act, 2025 (JRBEA).

The NTA and NTAA will take effect from January 1, 2026, while the NRSEA and JRBEA will commence on June 26, 2025, to allow for preparatory work ahead of full implementation.

What that means is that the official implementation of the rebranding of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to the Nigeria Revenue Service (NRS or the Service) as a centralised body for tax administration in Nigeria will take effect from June next year.

What the new tax laws say

Among the landmark provisions, the NTAA grants small companies—defined as businesses with annual turnover not exceeding N100 million and fixed assets below N250 million—complete tax exemption.

A look into the new Act shows that large companies also stand to benefit from a proposed reduction of corporate income tax from 30 percent to 25 percent, subject to a presidential order that would be issued on the advice of the National Economic Council.

For top-up taxes, the law sets a high exemption threshold: N50 billion in revenue for local firms and €750 million (or its equivalent) for multinational corporations.

Investors in priority economic sectors will also enjoy a tax credit of 5 percent per annum to encourage capital inflows and accelerate economic diversification.

Government officials have described the reforms as a bold step toward simplifying Nigeria’s tax regime, stimulating business growth, and boosting revenue mobilization.

Speaking earlier this year on the direction of fiscal reforms, the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Mr. Wale Edun, said the government’s aim was to “modernise tax administration, reduce the burden on small businesses, and create a more competitive environment for large corporates, while ensuring revenue adequacy to fund development priorities.”

Mr. Edun had also announced that the controversial 5 percent fuel surcharge, often described as a fuel tax, will not be enforced immediately.

Tax experts have also said that the provision allowing naira payment for foreign currency-linked taxes could ease compliance pressures on businesses, while also supporting exchange rate stability.

The government believes that the measure would reduce the dollarisation of the economy and promote confidence in the domestic currency.

The new tax framework signals a shift toward balancing revenue generation with economic competitiveness, in line with President Bola Tinubu’s broader reforms to reposition Nigeria’s economy for sustainable growth.",https://leadership.ng/new-tax-act-fresh-airfare-hike-looms-over-levies-on-aircraft-tickets-others/,https://leadership.ng
"Tinubu Has Ordered Us To Crash Food Prices, Says Minister","The Minister of State for Agriculture and Food Security, Senator Sabi Abdullahi, has revealed that President Bola Tinubu has ordered a committee within the Federal Executive Council to reduce food prices further nationwide.

Advertisement

Senator Abdullahi made the disclosure yesterday in Abuja during his presentation at a one-day capacity-building workshop for journalists covering the Senate.

He explained that reducing food prices would ensure the safe passage of agricultural foods and commodities along various transportation routes nationwide.

According to the Minister, the marching order on lowering food prices and securing the safe transit of agricultural commodities aligns with President Tinubu’s vision of food sovereignty.

He stated, “In addressing the high transportation costs of farm produce in the country, I can say on good authority that the President has issued a marching order. A Federal Executive Council committee is already working on promoting the safe passage of agricultural foods and commodities across our various routes.”

“We are aware—and I am sure you, as media members, are also aware—that there are routes through which commodities are transported before delivery. Considering the amount of money spent, you will understand why these commodities are expensive at delivery.”

“We are working very hard on this issue. I’ve shared just a snippet because I felt it was important for you to know.”

Senator Abdullahi explained that the vision of food sovereignty fell within the broader framework of food security and sufficiency, which included availability, accessibility, affordability, and the right nutritional content on a sustainable basis.

He added that other programmes, such as the Farmer Soil Health Scheme and cooperative reforms, were being planned for implementation.

“We have the Farmer Soil Health Scheme, ready for launch. We are just waiting to announce the date.”

“Another important initiative to note is our promotion and revamping of cooperative reforms.”

“Mr. President has shown tremendous interest in the cooperative sector as a powerful tool for resource mobilisation, economic activity generation, and improving members’ livelihoods.”

“As you know, the principle of cooperatives is democratic yet highly productive. We are undertaking several reforms in this sector, and I urge you, as press corps members, to consider forming a cooperative,” he said.",https://leadership.ng/tinubu-has-ordered-us-to-crash-food-prices-says-minister/,https://leadership.ng

“I have always made people realise that neither the Ooni of Ife nor the Alaafin of Oyo promotes disunity but their respective followers.

“These are the people who are trying to justify history, having forgotten the fact that history most of the time can be subjective.

“Alaafin cannot go to Ile-Ife and rule over the people there, vis-à-vis Ooni of Ife. They have their different territories where they are operating.

“The kind of history their supporters are referring to is like that of the history of Britain colonizing America. That was in the past. Today, if America sneezes, the entire Britain will catch a cold,” Oba Ladoja said.

He solicited the support of the Olugbon in strengthening the unity of monarchs across Yoruba land. “On the unity among the Obas in Yoruba land, I am soliciting the support of Olugbon of Orile-Igbon, Oba Alao. His wealth of experience will assist in this regard.”

While touching on the place of Ibadan in Yorubaland, the Olubadan-designate averred that if not for the influce of Ibadan, the entire Yoruba monarchs would have Emirs as their titles today.

He stated that history has well documented the pivotal role of Ibadan in shaping traditional leadership in Yorubaland, adding that the focus should now be on modernising what remains of what he described as former Ibadan Empire.

“The position of Ibadan on this matter is well documented in history, without the influence of Ibadan, the traditional title of the entire Obas in Yoruba land would have been ‘Emir’,” he said.

He added that Ibadan had already begun the process of modernization with all traditional rulers, including Baales and Mogajis playing critical roles.

“We have commenced the process of the modernization of Ibadan land. All the traditional rulers including Baales and Mogajis have critical roles to play in this regard,” Oba Ladoja said.

He maintained that the era of diaspora Baales and Mogajis was over as they must reside within their respective domains and would henceforth be held accountable for any breach in their respective communities.

“The era of diaspora Mogajis and Baales is over in Ibadan. If there is a breach of security in any community, the Baales and Mogajis will be held accountable,” he warned.",https://leadership.ng/alaafin-oonis-supporters-fuelling-supremacy-conflict-says-olubadan-designate/,https://leadership.ng
Recapitalisation: Fresh Mergers Loom For Tier-2 Banks As Deadline Nears – Report,"Pressure on Nigeria’s Tier-2 banks is intensifying as the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) March 2026 recapitalisation deadline approaches.

New research by SBM Intelligence warns that many may be swept up in a fresh wave of mergers and acquisitions.

In 2024, the CBN directed all commercial banks to raise their minimum paid-up capital to N500 billion for international banks, N200 billion for national banks, and N50 billion for regional banks.

According to the latest SBM report, “Capital, Competition, and Consolidation,” the new rules are designed “not merely as a compliance exercise but as a strategic imperative to fortify the sector’s capacity to withstand macroeconomic shocks, support Nigeria’s ambition for a $1 trillion economy, and restore global investor confidence.”

The report noted that Tier-1 banks such as Zenith, Access, and FBN Holdings remain firmly dominant with record profits and strong balance sheets, but mid-tier lenders are now fighting for survival.

“For Tier-2 banks, these developments present both a challenge and an opportunity. While some have made early strides in capital raising, many face the stark reality of needing to scale up rapidly or risk being subsumed in a wave of industry consolidation.

The ability of Tier-2 banks to navigate regulatory headwinds, leverage technology, and execute bold capital strategies will determine their place in the next chapter of Nigeria’s financial evolution.

The sector will likely witness further consolidation, with mergers and strategic alliances among mid-tier banks becoming more prevalent. This will create larger, more competitive institutions, but the risk of marginalising smaller players and potential integration challenges must be carefully managed.”

Already, some banks have made progress. Fidelity Bank raised over N270 billion through a public offer and rights issue that were oversubscribed by 238 per cent and 138 per cent, respectively. With its next phase of capital raising, it is on track to exceed the N500 billion threshold.

SBM noted that FCMB Group had adopted a “comprehensive, phased approach” targeting about N400 billion. The plan, broken into three phases, includes a public offer that raised N144.6 billion in early 2025, asset divestments of subsidiaries such as Credit Direct and FCMB Pensions, and final private placements with offshore investors.

According to the report, Wema Bank has pursued a two-tranche programme combining rights issues and private placements worth N200 billion. In December 2023, it completed a N40 billion rights issue, followed by a N150 billion raise in April 2025. A further N50 billion private placement is expected.

Sterling Financial Holdings, on its part, is seeking $400 million through a mix of private placements and a planned public offering.

Despite these moves, SBM warned that the recapitalisation process is not without risks, saying, “The prospect of such consolidation raises critical questions about the future structure of the sector, the competitive dynamics between banks, and the implications for customers, employees, and the broader economy.”

The report pointed to high funding costs, shrinking non-interest income, and the risk of loan defaults in a high-interest-rate environment, stating, “Many banks face the twin burden of expanding their asset base while keeping non-performing loans below regulatory thresholds.”",https://leadership.ng/recapitalisation-fresh-mergers-loom-for-tier-2-banks-as-deadline-nears-report/,https://leadership.ng
"‘Food Prices Have Crashed’, Agric Minister Speaks On Tinubu’s Emergency Interventions","Advertisement

Minister of Agriculture and Food Security, Senator Abubakar Kyari, has stated that President Bola Tinubu’s emergency measures on food security have started yielding results, insisting that food prices in the country “have crashed.”

Kyari made the remarks on Friday morning while speaking on Arise News ‘Day Break’ programme, where he defended the administration’s strategy of combining production support with temporary importation to address what he described as deep-rooted “structural imbalances” in Nigeria’s agriculture sector.

“There are tools if you want to take care of the structural imbalances in the agricultural sector,” Kyari said.

“I have said it before—even the former President of the African Development Bank during his tenure, he also imported. There are tools to manage what you already have.”

He noted that Tinubu inherited a difficult situation in 2023 when the president declared a state of emergency on food security, describing it as a “clarion call” to rescue the sector.

“President Bola Ahmed Tinubu came at a time when there was huge structural default in terms of food security and that is why he had to declare the clarion call and emergency on food security in July 2023,” the minister explained.

“Food availability, food security is a matter of entrepreneurial availability, supply and demand. In Nigeria so much availability and demand were not there, and part of the reason for the intervention was to ramp up production and at the same time import to make up the difference, because we do not have absolute production for all food crops that we have. Rice, for example—we have about 15% gap in what we can supply and what we have in the country.”

Kyari clarified that the temporary importation window introduced by the government was meant to stabilise prices without discouraging local farmers.

“The importation window was only for six months, and it has come and gone. And that was the amount that was demanded. When you look at the global demand field, it is not enough to make farmers discouraged with agricultural production,” he said.

The minister highlighted some of the interventions rolled out alongside imports, including large-scale fertiliser distribution.

“For example, while that was going on, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu ordered the Central Bank to release 2 million bags of fertiliser to the Federal Ministry of Agriculture for onward delivery free of charge at zero cost, and that was done,” Kyari disclosed.

“So at the end of the day, when you look at it, there were so many interventions. We had so many programmes that supported farmers with fertiliser at 50%. So, there was a lot of production in 2024.”

The minister concluded by stressing that the interventions had already begun to impact the market positively.

“I could say boldly that prices have crashed,” Kyari declared.

Kyari’s comments came as a direct response to President Tinubu’s fresh order to a Federal Executive Council (FEC) committee to “crash food prices” through swift and coordinated measures.",https://leadership.ng/food-prices-have-crashed-agric-minister-speaks-on-tinubus-emergency-interventions/,https://leadership.ng
"JUST-IN: Ex-AGF Malami Accuses Kebbi Governor Of Alleged Plans To Import Thugs, Foreign Mercenaries","Abubakar Malami, SAN, the immediate-past Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, and leader of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) in Kebbi State, has petitioned the National Security Adviser (NSA), Inspector General of Police (IGP), Director-General of the Department of State Services (DSS), and the Comptrollers-General of Immigration and Civil Defence Corps, over alleged plans to destabilise Kebbi State through the importation of political thugs, foreign mercenaries, and clandestine arms trafficking.

The former Minister specifically accused the Kebbi State governor Nasir Idris, of being behind sinister motives to silence opposition politicians in the State.

The petition, dated September 10, 2025, alleged that political actors were working with foreign mercenaries from the neighbouring Niger Republic and arming them through illegal channels. It further claimed that the individuals were being deployed to attack citizens, silence opposition voices, and undermine peace in the State.

According to Malami, the threats were not speculative but backed by credible intelligence and personal experience. He cited a September 1, 2025 incident in which he and his allies were allegedly attacked by armed thugs “operating without fear of law enforcement.”

The petition also accused the Kebbi State governor, Comrade Nasir Idris, and his associates, of facilitating the illegal operations, alleging covert links with the terrorist network Lakurawa.

The document described the situation as “a national security emergency” that goes beyond local politics and poses a direct threat to Nigeria’s sovereignty and internal stability.

Malami urged the NSA and other security chiefs to take urgent steps by coordinating inter-agency action across security services, securing border communities to prevent the influx of mercenaries and arms, and launching a high-level investigation into the alleged collusion between state officials and terrorist elements.

According to a post on the verified Facebook page of Malami on Thursday night, a statement signed by his media aide, Mohammed Bello Doka, said the petition was copied to the heads of the DSS, Police, Immigration, and Civil Defence, underscoring the urgency of the concerns raised.",https://leadership.ng/just-in-ex-agf-malami-accuses-kebbi-governor-of-alleged-plans-to-import-thugs-foreign-mercenaries/,https://leadership.ng

"Korea Centre Exposes Abuja Pupils To Games, Creativity At Workshop","At the Korea Culture Centre Nigeria (KCCN), 40 FCT pupils witnessed new ways of seeing and creating through ‘play’ activities, such as drawing and movement.

Advertisement

Facilitated by Korean artistes and partners, Jung-won Ye (visual artist) and Jin-ju Kang (dancer), with the support of KCCN and the Korea Arts & Culture Education Service, the ‘Encountering Art: Ways of Seeing’ workshop saw the children aged 6 – 14 years, from LEA Primary School, Suka, AMAC, and Greater Seed Richmaris Academy, embark on a series of playful, artistic activities over a four-hour period that enhanced their sense of perception and process of creating.

In the first two hours with Ye, the children played popular Korean games – the superhero game – where they indicate unique abilities they possess; the ‘Don-gas’ game – an image hopscotch game, where the main idea is to block another player’s movement, who tries as much as possible to wriggle free without touching their playmates, or are ousted from the game.

Lastly, the eraser skipping game – where they take turns (as a team) to create images on a plain paper, by placing and flicking erasers from one point to another, then drawing a line from the point of origin to where the eraser landed. The pupil then identifies and paints over new images (shapes or objects) observed within the overall picture.

Kang’s session began with a short, contemporary dance performance, introducing the children to her work as an artist. She then dismantled her work process and aesthetics, using the Hangeul alphabet. She had the children recreate the letters with their bodies and then write them down on paper.

She translated the words to English and had the children rewrite them in beautiful calligraphy before rearranging the words into aesthetic images superglued on paper. She also had the children assess images of people to identify their emotions and finally observe and notate pictorially the movement in plants.

Of what importance are these series of activities? How did these activities impact the children?

It begins with ‘play’. Play is not just an activity; it is an experience that is pleasurable. While the process of play may differ for adults and children; the former, because it is self-chosen, and for the children, particularly in a group setting as the workshop, as it is guided by the facilitators – the general rule of play indicates that there is a set-boundary, with more value placed in the process than the outcome. It is also imaginative, engaging and involves an alert but non-stressed frame of mind.

Why is ‘play’ important for children, teenagers or adults?

“Everyone plays,” said Ye. “Whether it is washing plates, dancing or scribbling something random on paper. Everyone has the capacity to play. In Korea, we have a saying, “if you play well, you live well”. So, the more you infuse arts and fun, the better for anyone.”

Beyond imbuing the pupils with a pleasant experience they’ll recall in the future, it unlocks in them new ways of perception.

“Today, we had the children flicking erasers. While we may not see it, something has registered in their minds, and that thought will recur at some point. They would say, “I remember flicking erasers with the teacher, I really loved that moment”. That is because eraser is meant for erasing things, but they used it to play and draw, and that is different than what they are used to,” Ye said.

For Kang, dance/movement is a form of play that anyone can relate to. It is about communication and finding connection through movement, regardless of the boundary or barrier of language.

A professional dancer, she had lost the initial ‘feeling’ dance gave her in the pursuit of skill and perfection. Post-reflection, she realised it was that initial ‘feeling’ that had kept her dancing, she began looking for ways to infuse that ‘feeling (pleasurable experience)’ in her work of teaching people the art of playing through dance.

“When I look around today, I see dance in how people walk along the streets, how plants move, and I expanded that horizon because I felt that was something everyone can relate to. I feel that we communicate through dance – whether it is with children, the older generation or like today, where we are working with children with whom we have a language barrier, we have communicated through movement.

“I feel everything in the world is connected – thoughts, movements etc. It all starts from the imagination. You imagine it, note it on paper and then express it through your body.

“Although there are differences in perception, although they may see me as a foreigner, we were all still able to connect and communicate. In other words, don’t be afraid of new things. Find a middle ground to connect and go from there,” Kang said.

Once a connection is made, boundaries of play can be broken, which can result in beautiful moments as Ye discovered.

For instance, there was a particular team of pupils who didn’t play according to the rules of the game. Rather than flick their erasers one after another, they did so simultaneously. She let them be because she believes that is art in itself and fun for the children.

Just as she saw art and creativity in another team’s engagement in a random game of trying to capture ‘fine dust’ often seen in shafts of light floating through the air.

“I set a boundary, which they broke, but I liked it, and intend to introduce that in my work back home. That’s because with things like this, we find possibilities of improvement – of building a whole new world of art – just as we did with the different things that we took here and there – in workshops like this back in Korea, that were created by the children we worked with.

“We look at everything that happened today as sparking another level of creativity for us.”

For Ye and Kang, working with Nigerian children was a big dream worth revisiting.

“I believe we have opened doors for one another through the arts today – no matter how short the time. For the children, I hope they leave with the feeling of loving the arts that I saw today, and that the artistry they have experienced today helps them in the future,” Kang said.

For practitioners of different art genres, the odds of their paths crossing were slim. However, courtesy of a culture centre in Korea, both artists met in 2024, forging a connection through in discovering their shared interest.

Both are proof that creative collaborations can happen regardless of the diversity of disciplines. They have since worked together in similar projects in Mexico, Argentina, Abu Dhabi and now Nigeria.

“Our meeting and doing these workshops are much more special. More special and different from the individual work I do with organisations like KOICA. I hope the Nigerian government can work with the Korea Culture Centre to extend our stay next time – perhaps a month. We are willing to return to Nigeria,” Ye declared.",https://leadership.ng/korea-centre-exposes-abuja-pupils-to-games-creativity-at-workshop/,https://leadership.ng
Yobe South APC Begs Tinubu To Address Lopsided Appointments,"Members of the All Progressives Congress from Yobe South cried out to President Bola Tinubu on Thursday over what they described as the “total exclusion” of their zone from federal appointments.

A delegation led by Hon. Sambo Kakawa stormed the Presidential Villa in Abuja to protest what they called a glaring imbalance in the distribution of appointments from the state.

“According to INEC data of 2023, Yobe South is leading with 43% of Yobe State’s total registered votes, with over 617,781 votes out of the total 1,485,141 of the state.

“Despite being an APC stronghold and contributing significantly to the party’s victories in the 2023 election, Yobe South has been entirely excluded from President Tinubu’s appointments.

“In contrast, the minorities in the two zones of Yobe state have received more appointments,” the group said.

Kakawa argued that Yobe East and Yobe North have produced ministers, directors-general, executive secretaries and several board members. Yobe South has nothing to show despite being the state’s most populous zone.

“In politics, population and majority votes are key considerations for leaders. We hope President Tinubu will heed the voice of the majority of people of Yobe South, recognising their significant contribution to the state’s population and electoral strength, and consider their aspirations for representation in his administration,” he added.

The stakeholders warned that the continued marginalisation of the zone could affect APC’s fortunes in the 2027 elections.

They also pushed for appointing Haruna Sardauna, a Yobe South indigene and Director General of Renewed Hope Ambassadors, as the next Minister of Humanitarian Affairs while urging Governor Mai Mala Buni to intervene.

However, some State House officials who received the delegation assured them that their grievances would be addressed.

In the last two years, the president has constantly been criticised following allegations that he favours certain regions over others regarding federal appointments.

Among his critics are Senator Ali Ndume (Borno South), Northern Elders Forum and some prominent elites, who argued that his action violated Section 14(3) of Nigeria’s constitution, which mandates that appointments reflect federal character.",https://leadership.ng/yobe-south-apc-begs-tinubu-to-address-lopsided-appointments/,https://leadership.ng
"Plans To Stop INEC Recognition Of Mark, Aregbesola Failed – ADC","Barely 24 hours after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) recognised former Senate President David Mark and former Interior Minister Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola as national chairman and national secretary of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), a legal move to stop the electoral body’s action emerged yesterday.

Former ADC deputy national chairman Hon Nafiu Bala Gombe had filed an ex parte application in the Federal High Court in Abuja, seeking to stop INEC from recognising Mark and Aregbesola’s leadership of the party.

However, the ADC leadership has clarified that, contrary to misleading reports, the Federal High Court in Abuja did not issue any order restraining Mark and Aregbesola from acting as the party’s national chairman and national secretary.

ADC national publicity secretary Malam Bolaji Abdullahi said the court presided over by Hon. Justice Emeka Nwite, in its ruling on September 4, 2025 refused the ex-parte application filed by Hon. Nafiu Bala Gombe and instead ordered that the defendants be put on notice to appear to show cause why the application should not be granted, and adjourned the matter to September 15, 2025.

Since former ADC national chairman Ralph Nwosu formally handed over the party’s leadership to the opposition coalition movement in July, some aggrieved members have rejected the move and refused to recognise the Mark-led leadership.

Dumebi Kachikwu, the party’s former presidential candidate, has repeatedly rejected the Mark-led group while Bala Gombe declared himself the party’s national chairman.

However, the Mark-led ADC revealed that Bala Gombe had resigned as ADC deputy national chairman and insisted that all processes leading to its party takeover were legitimate.

The dispute over the party’s leadership came to a definitive stand when INEC formally recognised Mark and Aregbesola on its official website.

ADC reacts to court injunction

ADC national spokesman Bolaji Abdullahi accused the opposing camp of resorting to fake news by claiming that the court has restrained INEC from recognising Mark and Aregbesola.

Describing them as political jobbers, Abdullahi said fake news has become their last resort of desperation.

“They had been disappointed by INEC’s decision to stand on the side of the Nigerians by acknowledging the party’s leadership change,” he said.

While urging the media and the public to beware of fake news and to verify information to avoid misleading Nigerians, the ADC spokesman said the court did not issue any order restraining Mark and Aregbesola from functioning as the ADC national chairman and secretary, respectively.

“Instead, the Honourable Court refused the ex parte application brought by Hon. Nafiu Bala Gombe and directed that the matter proceed with due process.

“This goes to show that these agents of destabilisation will stop at nothing, including misrepresenting court rulings, in their desperate efforts to sow confusion and further undermine opposition parties.”

Aggrieved Members Welcome Court Action Against Mark, Aregbesola

Meanwhile, aggrieved members hailed the Federal High Court’s recent decision restraining Mark, Aregbesola, and others from parading themselves as the party’s national executive members.

They said the ruling validated its position on the legitimacy of its leadership and reaffirmed its determination to restore what it described as the “authentic glory” of the ADC.

Dr. Christopher O. Okechukwu, who said he is ADC’s director of media and public affairs, described the development as a victory for order within the party.

He said, “The Federal High Court’s order restraining Sen. David Mark, Rauf Aregbesola, and others from parading themselves as National Executive members of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) has vindicated our position. We welcome this development and reaffirm our commitment to reclaiming and restoring the party.”

He extended an invitation to prominent political figures, including Mark, Aregbesola, former Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Labour Party’s Peter Obi, former Transportation Minister Rotimi Amaechi, coalition members, and Nigerians at large to join the ADC.

Okechukwu urged party stakeholders to rally behind the leadership of Hon. Nafiu Bala as national chairman, stressing that unity was essential for repositioning the party.

According to him, plans are underway to roll out a seamless membership registration exercise, with membership cards and registers to be distributed nationwide.

Court Refuses To Stop Mark, Aregbesola From Assuming ADC Leadership

Justice Emeka Nwite of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has turned down a motion seeking to stop David Mark-led leadership of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) pending the hearing of the substantive suit.

The court refused the three prayers sought in the ex parte motion filed by Mr Nafiu-Bala Gombe, a former deputy national chairman of the party, through his lawyer, Michael Agber.

The court asked the plaintiff in the suit to put all the defendants on notice to show cause why the motion should not be granted.

The judge then adjourned the matter until Sept. 15 for the defendants to show cause.

The former Senate President, David Mark, is the current national chairman of ADC, and the ex-Osun Governor, Rauf Aregbesola, is the party’s national secretary.

The plaintiff, in the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/1819/2025, had sued ADC, Sen. Mark, Aregbesola, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and Chief Ralph Nwosu as 1st to 5th defendants respectively.

The plaintiff sought three reliefs in the ex parte motion dated and filed on September 2.

The local government chairmen of the ADC in Owerri Zone have raised alarm over political actors’ attempts to hijack the party’s structure in the zone. State

They declared that any attempt to hijack and subvert the structure will be entirely resisted.

This was made known through a communiqué issued by the chairmen, who accused unnamed political actors of plotting to impose illegal leadership and undermine the ADC constitution, warning that such moves will be met with “decisive and lawful resistance.”

Seven LGA Chairmen jointly signed the statement: Dr. Oparaogu Jonathan (Owerri West), Hon. Prince Oscar Obinna (Ngor Okpala), Hon. Ohahu Charles (Owerri North), Dr. Nwagwuaji Fidelis (Aboh Mbaise), Chief Onuoha Augustine (Ezinihitte Mbaise), Engr. Uhuogbu Ferdinand (Mbaitoli), and Chief Akumonye Francis (Ikeduru).

Rejecting “brazen subversion,” the chairmen stressed that no fraudulent list concocted outside the party’s framework would be recognised.

They highlighted that the ADC constitution remains the supreme guide for all party activities, and any violation amounts to an assault on members’ collective will.

Reaffirming their legitimacy, the chairmen insisted they remain the only authentic leaders of the ADC in their LGAs.

“We hold our mandate directly from the people and shall not surrender it to impostors.”

…. Same in Lokoja

Similarly, a concerned group in the Kogi State chapter of the ADC has said that it will resist any forceful and unconstitutional takeover of the party structure in the state by people they referred to as strange interlopers.

In a communique read by Usman Lukman, the group particularly warned members of the coalition, who they said are seeking to forcefully take over the party in the state, to be guided by the party’s constitution and other relevant laws.

The group also alerted party members and supporters, security agencies, and the general public to what it described as a disturbing development that aimed to undermine the party’s peace, stability, and integrity.

The group noted that credible intelligence indicates that specific individuals, unknown to their structures and alien to their operations, are plotting to forcefully take over the leadership of the ADC in Kogi State.

“While the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria guarantees freedom of association, and while our party constitution equally provides avenues for legitimate membership, no individual or group has the right to unconstitutionally topple the leadership of our party.

“Let it be stated that the ADC is governed by its constitution, values, and democratic ethos. Those who recklessly destroyed the PDP cannot be allowed to invade our party and subject it to the same fate.

“The ADC in Kogi State was built painstakingly from the grassroots and nurtured with sacrifice, loyalty, and discipline. Any attempt to hijack it through unconstitutional means will be firmly resisted using every legal and constitutional instrument.

“To avoid doubt, we reaffirm our unflinching loyalty to Rt. Hon. Elder Leke Abejide, the undisputed leader of the African Democratic Congress in Kogi State. We do not recognise or associate with political opportunists and strange bedfellows who seek to crawl in through the window and destabilise our collective heritage.

“We therefore call on all security agencies in Kogi State to take urgent notice of this threat and act decisively to prevent any breakdown of law and order.

“ Our democracy thrives on order, respect for process, and adherence to the rule of law, not on desperate power grabs by faceless interlopers.:

They therefore advised security agencies in Kogi State not to honour, recognise, or provide security coverage for any meeting, gathering, or activity in the name of the ADC that does not emanate from the party leader, Rt Hon. Leke Abejide, or the constitutionally recognised state chairman of the ADC.

He declared that any such gathering by people he described as faceless interlopers, fake members, and impostors is illegal, illegitimate, and a calculated attempt to breach the peace and security of Kogi State.",https://leadership.ng/plans-to-stop-inec-recognition-of-mark-aregbesola-failed-adc/,https://leadership.ng

"I’ll Champion Council Autonomy, Tinubu’s Re-election As Ekiti Governor – Ojo","A governorship aspirant in Ekiti State on the platform of the All Progressives Congress(APC), Engr Kayode Ojo, has promised to grant local autonomy and transform infrastructure in the state if elected.

Ojo who is the chancellor and chairman of the Governing Council, University Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), made the promises while addressing journalists after he submitted his expression of interest and nomination forms at the APC National Secretariat in Abuja yesterday.

The governorship hopeful expressed the confidence that he would win the October 27 APC primary election and next year’s governorship election, saying he enjoys the support of party members.

Ojo also said he was opened to any method the party would adopt for the conduct of the governorship primaries but appealed for a level playing ground so that all aspirants can freely test their popularity.

“Our agenda is clear and achievable. We will align with Mr President’s Renewed Hope Agenda. We will unite party members, address grievances, and ensure their welfare.

“We will prudently utilise Ekiti’s resources to transform infrastructure, improve agriculture, education, and enhance welfare for teachers, students, civil servants, artisans, and all sectors.

“We will implement local government autonomy fully, develop Ado-Ekiti as a befitting state capital, and build Ekiti’s economy. We will never hand over what belongs to our party to those who do not share our progressive values.

“Our party leaders have stated that they will ensure the election of a popular candidate who can win, not someone who will struggle. I am that candidate. We enjoy the support of the majority of APC members in the state.

“We are confident of winning the primary and achieving a resounding victory in the general election. We seek only a level playing field from the National Executive, free of intimidation and harassment. Security operatives must ensure protection for all members as they campaign,,” he said.

Ojo assured President Bola Tinubu, that with him as governor, Ekitj state will be secured for his re-election in 2027.

“This election is about a leader capable of mobilising for the President’s ongoing reforms not someone who will alienate the people through non -performance. We will unite all Ekiti people to support the President as he continues his reforms to elevate Nigeria,”he said.

Ojo further noted that, “contrary to a statement attributed to APC National Secretary (Ajibola Bashir)

suggesting that obtaining a nomination form is a waste of resources because no vacancy exists in the Ekiti State Government House, I am here to inform our great party and the nation that the people of Ekiti are yearning for a change, calling for a rescuer and they want it now. The forms we submit today is a response to that clarion call. We are poised to effect the change.”",https://leadership.ng/ill-champion-council-autonomy-tinubus-re-election-as-ekiti-governor-ojo/,https://leadership.ng

Ekiti APC Chieftain Warns Against Divisive Tendencies,"A chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State, Hon. Gold Adedayo, has advised those stoking the embers of division and acrimony within the party to eschew such acts.

Adedayo who is the immediate past commissioner for Youth Development in the state, urged the party leaders, supporters and members to cooperate with Governor Biodun Oyebanji to emerge as candidate at next month’s primary and push APC to victory in the June 20,2026 governorship election.

He said it is only in the atmosphere of peace ,unity and spirit of aggressive support mobilisation that member can deliver all the 177 wards and 16 local government areas of the state to the governor and emerged the winner of the APC primary election to elect the party flagbearer on October 27 and the 2026 gubernatorial poll proper.

The former commissioner in a statement issued in Ado Ekiti yesterday predicted landslide victory for the governor adding that this is the best way to send a signal to those nursing a pipe dream of hijacking the ticket through the back- channel that their mission has been aborted.

The APC leader in Moba local government area of the state , boasted that Governor Oyebanji is in a good stead to triumph in the October 27, 2025 party’s governorship primary without stiff opposition and strong opponent that can rock the boat, contrary to what was being portrayed on social media platforms, by adversaries.

“Every discerning Ekiti man knows that Governor Biodun Oyebanji has no strong opponent in the APC primary and even the major election coming next year.

“With President Bola Tinubu, Dr Kayode Fayemi, Otunba Niyi Adebayo, Dr Ayodele Fayose, Engr Segun Oni and most importantly, the Ekiti people showing love to him, victory is certain at all levels of these elections.

“Lies can’t travel far and it has a short lifespan. Their lies on social media are beginning to fizzle out and Ekiti people have realised that the governor’s traducers are neither on ground, nor pose any threat, but only exist on social media where they spew out their concocted narratives,” he added.",https://leadership.ng/ekiti-apc-chieftain-warns-against-divisive-tendencies/,https://leadership.ng

"Blocking Natasha’s Return, Assault on Democracy, NLC Slams Senate","The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has condemned the continued barring of Senator Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan, who represents Kogi Central, from resuming her legislative duties.

Advertisement

The labour centre described the action of the Godswill Akpabio-led Senate as a grave assault on Nigeria’s democracy.

In a statement signed by its president, Comrade Joe Ajaero, yesterday, the NLC accused the Senate of deliberately undermining the constitution and the judiciary by refusing to comply with court rulings that voided the senator’s suspension.

The Congress noted that the Senate’s insistence on citing subjudice as an excuse to prolong the suspension, even after the expiration of six months, amounted to legislative bad faith and revealed a calculated attempt to silence dissent.

“The decision to deprive Senator Akpoti-Uduaghan of her constitutional roles is not merely an error in judgment; it is a brazen, premeditated assault on democracy itself, a direct threat to the social contract, and a dangerous slide towards fascism masquerading as governance.

This action, led by Senator Akpabio, constitutes a gross abuse of power that shames the hallowed chambers of the National Assembly and spits on the collective will of the people of Kogi Central who elected Senator Akpoti-Uduaghan,” the NLC said.

The labour movement warned that disenfranchising an entire senatorial district was equivalent to stealing the representation that citizens had lawfully secured at the ballot box.

It argued that denying Kogi Central its place in lawmaking and appropriation amounted to deepening exclusion and economic injustice.

According to the labour movement, the development represents a dangerous signal to Nigerians that political elites could render their votes meaningless. It described the move as a “test-run” for silencing opposition voices before the 2027 elections.

“The Nigerian people, united across ethnic and religious lines, will not stand idly by while you cannibalise our democracy,” the NLC declared.

“The labour movement, as the historic defender of justice and the common good, will mobilise its immense membership and moral authority to resist this slide into autocracy; an attack on one senator today is an attack on the sovereignty of every Nigerian voter tomorrow,” the statement added.

“We warn the leadership of the National Assembly and their enablers: the Nigerian people, united across ethnic and religious lines, will not stand idly by while you cannibalise our democracy.

COSGON President Raises Alarm Over Dwindling Gymnastics Fortune In Nigeria,"The President of the Coalition of Supporter Groups of Nigeria (COSGON), Professor Kunle Awosika, has issued a scathing statement calling for immediate government’s intervention into what he described as the “systematic decay” within the The Nigerian Federation of Gymnastics (NFG) also called Gymnastics Federation of Nigeria.

In an open letter made available to the media, Professor Awosika alleged that the Federation, under the leadership of Prince Kelvin Erhunmunse, was plagued by deep-rooted leadership crises, unconstitutional tenure elongation, election irregularities, amongst others.

He claimed that the current administration has undermined the credibility of the sport and placed it on the brink of collapse.

“We are no longer dealing with just poor leadership. This is now about the death of a sport that once held promise for Nigeria’s Olympic ambitions,” Awosika said.

According to the COSGON President, access to quality facilities and international competitions remained out of reach for deserving athletes.

“Athletes lack standard training facilities. Grassroots development has been abandoned, and Nigeria’s presence on the international gymnastics stage is almost nonexistent,” he stated.

Despite gymnastics being one of the most prestigious Olympic disciplines globally, Nigeria’s performance in the sport has stagnated, trailing behind even smaller African nations in competition and development.

Awosika urged the National Sports Commission (NSC), and the Nigeria Olympics Committee (NOC) to immediately investigate the Federation’s activities.

The Professor also called on the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) to send an independent fact-finding delegation to assess the situation in Nigeria.

“The credibility and future of Nigerian gymnastics are at stake. The current trajectory can no longer be ignored. It is time for decisive, corrective action,” he said.

The Coalition warned that should the government fail to act, COSGON would mobilise civil society, athletes, and the wider sporting community for nationwide advocacy campaigns and potential legal actions.",https://leadership.ng/cosgon-president-raises-alarm-over-dwindling-gymnastics-fortune-in-nigeria/,https://leadership.ng

Team Nigeria Aims For Medal Glory As 2025 World Athletics Championships Begin In Tokyo,"Advertisement

Nigeria is gearing up for a formidable challenge at the 20th World Athletics Championships which commence on Saturday in Tokyo, Japan.

The country’s quest for medal success will be spearheaded by discus thrower Obiageri Pamela Amaechi, who previously secured a bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games.

After returning without a medal from the last Championships in Budapest, Hungary, in 2023, Nigeria is determined to reclaim its position on the podium.

The team, led by former World 100m hurdles champion Tobi Amusan and talented 400m hurdler Nathaniel Ezekiel, aims to secure at least one medal this year.

Amaechi, 26, will launch Nigeria’s campaign as she competes in the qualifying rounds of the discus throw. She is drawn in the first of two qualifying groups and is expected to face reigning Commonwealth Games champion Chioma Onyekwere-Lyons.

Amaechi’s recent achievement of a personal best throw of 64.80m at ‘Throw Town’ in Ramona, Oklahoma, has set her hopes high for making history as the first Nigerian woman to qualify for the World Championships final.

In addition, Ezekiel, who recently matched his African record of 22.10m at the Prefontaine Classic Diamond League meet, is aiming not just for a final place but to better his eighth-place finish from 2019.

Completing the roster of field event competitors on the opening day are Ese Brume and Prestina Ochonogor.

Ochonogor, the reigning African U20 champion and Paris Olympic finalist, will seek to follow in the footsteps of Blessing Okagbare and Brume to become Nigeria’s third long jumper to reach the podium.

In order to secure a finals spot, Ochonogor will need to surpass her season’s best of 6.67m, aiming for her personal best of 6.79m to stand a chance in a competitive field.

Brume, competing in her fourth consecutive World Championships, will fight for a finals spot in the second qualifying group. She has consistently finished in the top ranks since 2017, with her sights set on replicating her 6.79m personal best.

On the track, three Nigerian athletes will make their debut on the first day. While the men’s 100m heats start list is yet to be confirmed, Rosemary Chukwuma has secured her place in lane 7 of the second heat.

The 23-year-old faces stiff competition from athletes including Polish sprinter Ewa Swoboda and veteran British star Dina Asher-Smith, as she aims for a second consecutive semifinal appearance.

Key medal contenders, Tobi Amusan and Ezekiel Nathaniel will enter the fray on subsequent days, with Amusan competing on Day 2 and Nathaniel on Day 3 of the nine-day event.

Nigeria’s campaign will reach its conclusion on Day 7, coinciding with the finals of the men’s 400m hurdles and 200m events.

As the excitement builds in Tokyo, all eyes will be on Nigeria’s athletes as they strive to bring home much-needed medals and restore national pride in the world of athletics.",https://leadership.ng/team-nigeria-aims-for-medal-glory-as-2025-world-athletics-championships-begin-in-tokyo/,https://leadership.ng

"Oshodi Re-elected President Of Judo Federation, Outlines Vision For Growth, Grassroots Dev’t","Dr Musa Oshodi has been re-elected unopposed as the President of the Nigeria Judo Federation (NJF) for a second term of four years.

The elections, conducted yesterday in Abuja, resulted in the emergence of Salisu Muhammad Aliyu and Lawrence Esudu as the first and second vice presidents of the Federation, respectively. Both were elected unopposed, alongside Jude Aifuwa Atoe from Benin, who also secured the position of Secretary-General of NJF without opposition.

In other key positions, Franca Audu was elected as the Athlete Representative on the NJF board, while Amos Iliya claimed the role of Technical Representative, and Jeneth Ewagu was voted in as Treasurer of the Federation.

The elected zonal representatives are as follows: Salisu Mohammed Aliyu – North West; Ado Umar Garko – North East; Damisa Suleiman – North Central; Musa Oshodi – South West; Esudu Lawrence – South East; and Josh Franklin – South South.

Speaking to journalists after taking the oath of office for his second term, President Musa Oshodi unveiled a bold and forward-looking agenda aimed at consolidating past achievements and elevating the sport to new heights.

“This second term is not just a continuation—it is about consolidation and advancement,” Oshodi declared. “We will build on the gains we’ve made and push forward with renewed energy and purpose.”

He reaffirmed his commitment to positioning judo as a premier sport in Nigeria, alongside football, athletics, and wrestling, stating that his core agenda focuses on upgrading the skills of athletes, coaches, and referees through professional training programmes.

“We cannot focus solely on athletes—our coaches and referees are equally important. Coaches train them, and referees represent our federation on the global stage. We must enhance their technical and mental capacity.”

Oshodi highlighted the importance of investing in sports infrastructure and announced plans to form a credible marketing committee composed of experienced professionals to realise the federation’s ambitious goals.

“Our dreams will not remain on paper. With solid marketing and partnerships, we will bring them to life. We intend to treat judo as a business—not just a sport. We want our youth to take pride in wearing the judo badge and to choose judo over other sports.”

Oshodi promised that his second term would witness a robust grassroots revival plan, including cadet and junior tournaments nationwide.

“We’re going back to the grassroots. That’s where the real talent lies, and that’s where the future of Nigerian judo begins. Without grassroots development, we’re only deceiving ourselves.”

He added that these grassroots initiatives would be consistent and strategic, ensuring sustainability and long-term impact.

Looking ahead, Oshodi outlined the federation’s strategy for international representation, particularly in relation to future Olympic Games.

“We’ve progressed from having no athletes to having seven or eight in the Olympic qualifying zone. The next step is to participate in as many international championships as possible to gain ranking points.”

He emphasised the need for early preparation and close monitoring of elite athletes, many of whom are training abroad.

“We want to ensure they receive access to grants and proper training. Our national coaches will maintain close oversight, regardless of where these athletes are based.”

Oshodi also acknowledged the support of the National Sports Commission (NSC) and the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC), reiterating his commitment to maintaining a smooth, collaborative relationship with all stakeholders.

"Key Argument: Export Ban Risks Shifting Profit From Women Pickers To Processors, Not The Government","SHEA collection makes contribution to the total income of rural households belonging to different economic groups. Also, it quantifies the involvement of women in Shea nuts and fruits collection and processing.

Advertisement

Shea nut collection provides women collectors opportunity for upward economic mobility, women account for 90% of Shea nut collection and are at the lowest end of the value chain.

In Africa, the unique experience of each of the 16 million rural women who make a living from Shea nut inspires us more and more every day. Shea is an important crop, both economically and socially. It employs 4 million women for export and generates approximately USD 600 million a year in income at the community level in West Africa. At the household level, Shea accounts for up to 12% of household income and up to 32% of cash available, which is earned during the lean season. Moreover, Shea nut collection and processing were found to provide a valuable source of cash income to female household members who otherwise have very few income possibilities.

Shea nut collection provides economic resilience in term of income, assets and savings; Social resilience in form of women decision makeup at home. It also provides employment, medicinal benefits and nutrition.

Shea is crucial for rural women families and their livelihoods and for their generation. Shea collection and processing is a way for households to diversify their livelihood strategy and decrease their vulnerability to food insecurity and climate variability.

1. Value Redistribution Without Equity

The blanket ban on raw shea nut exports creates an artificial market structure in which:

Women pickers (who collect 90%+ of raw nuts) are forced to sell locally,

Local processors become the sole buyers, creating a monopsony (one buyer, many sellers),

Processors purchase at artificially suppressed prices, increasing their margins,

They export processed shea butter (crude or semi-refined) at global prices—capturing the bulk of the profit.

In essence, the export ban does not create new wealth—it reallocates existing wealth away from the grassroots to the processing middlemen.

2. Women and Smallholders Lose Bargaining Power

In the open market, women groups could negotiate export contracts, participate in cooperatives, or benefit from global demand-driven pricing.

Under a ban, that freedom is removed, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by dominant processors.

They bear the economic shock of lower prices while processors enjoy risk-free profits.

This contradicts the intended goals of gender empowerment and poverty alleviation. As currently designed, the ban:

Weakens rural women’s negotiating power, and

Benefits industrial processors, who may not reinvest profits locally or transparently.

3. Weak Local Processing Capacity

While Nigeria has a few industrial-scale processors and many small cottage-level producers, these facilities together can only process a hundred of thousands of metric tons of shea nuts annually which is 1/3 rd of total shea nut production.

of total shea nut production. The majority of local processors are small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with limited capital. They cannot raise enough funds to buy such massive volumes upfront.

Purchasing shea nuts requires huge upfront payments during harvest season, when supply peaks.

Much of the harvested shea is left unprocessed domestically because factories lack the capacity, technology, and investment needed to handle it.

The absence of robust domestic processing and storage infrastructure results in spoilage and significant post-harvest losses.

With Nigeria producing far more shea than its industries can absorb, farmers are left without sufficient domestic buyers, forcing a substantial portion of nuts to remain unsold.

4. No Guarantee of Government Revenue

The current policy framework lacks mechanisms to ensure that processors’ profits are taxed, regulated, or redistributed for public benefit. Key risks:

Processors may under-declare profits or shift revenue offshore,

Informal and SME processors might avoid tax obligations entirely,

The government will gain little or no fiscal benefit unless tied to robust tax and compliance systems.

Without revenue capture policies, the government’s goal of economic growth becomes an illusion—growth for whom?

5. Encourages Rent-Seeking, Not Industrial Transformation

With guaranteed raw material access at cheap prices (due to the ban), some processors may lack incentive to invest in quality, innovation, or scaling capacity.

The market becomes uncompetitive and prone to rent-seeking behaviour:

o Low pay to pickers, o Minimal innovation, o Export-focused without domestic development benefits.

6. Policy Inversion: The Poor Subsidizing the Rich

This policy results in the reverse of inclusive growth:

Rural women and poor smallholders subsidize the profits of processors,

Meanwhile, government collects minimal tax and provides little support infrastructure.

These risks replicating past policy failures seen in Cocoa, Cotton, and Groundnut sectors, where:

Raw material producers remained poor, despite Nigeria’s global role in supply chains.

What the Government Must Do Instead

To ensure that value addition benefits are shared, the government must urgently:

✅ 1. Mandate Fair Pricing

Require a minimum floor price for shea nuts, tied to global demand and currency valuation.

Establish price monitoring boards with women’s cooperatives as stakeholders.

✅ 2. Tax Processor Exports

Introduce value-based export taxes on processed shea products, ensuring profits are taxed.

Use collected revenue to fund rural women’s cooperatives, training, and equipment.

✅ 3. Build Cooperative Power

Direct funds to build women-led processing hubs, so women can process, brand, and export their own products—keeping profits local. ✅ 4. Create a Phased Transition

Allow controlled raw export through licensed cooperatives while local processing capacity is scaled.

Ban should come after capacity is proven, not before.

Conclusion: A Ban Without Balance Hurts the Wrong People

While the export ban intends to drive local industrial growth, in its current form, it:

Creates imbalance in the shea value chain,

Shifts power and profit away from the grassroots, and

Delivers little measurable benefit to the Nigerian government in tax or trade terms.

Instead of empowering the vulnerable, the ban consolidates market power into the hands of a few.

A fair shea policy must protect women, generate state revenue, and build competitive, equitable local industry. Not one at the expense of the others.

Government is requested not to fall for developing such monopoly cartels as the local industries already having advantage of local presence and are successfully competing.

Need is also to invest in technology to enable women collectors to store the product and reduce distress sale. Access to loans and programs to support women to acquire technology would enable them to seize the more profitable segments of value chain.

Government also needs to focus on improving quality of Shea nuts and provide training to women collectors for sustainable harvesting, storage and local value addition.

Any proposed ban needs to be carefully thought in a holistic manner, giving due consideration to centuries old prevalent social customs, values, practices and rural economics, and in doing so commercial interests should be last priority which is benefiting only 2-3 local processors in creating abusive monopoly.",https://leadership.ng/key-argument-export-ban-risks-shifting-profit-from-women-pickers-to-processors-not-the-government/,https://leadership.ng

"Consumer Protection Commission Resolves 9,091 Complaints, Recovers N10bn","The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) said it had successfully resolved 9,091 consumer complaints in the six months from March to August 2025, recovering over N10 billion on behalf of affected Nigerians.

FCCPC said that banking and fintech services were the leading sources of consumer complaints in Nigeria between March and August 2025, with over N10 billion recovered for aggrieved customers within the period.

The Commission disclosed this in a sectoral report released in Abuja, which provided fresh data on grievances lodged through its complaint resolution platforms. The FCCPC said the dataset, covering 30 sectors of the economy, highlighted recurring patterns of consumer dissatisfaction across essential services.

According to the Commission, the banking sector accounted for 3,173 complaints, the highest during the reporting window. It explained that most cases involved loan deductions, account charges, transaction disputes, and poor redress mechanisms. The FCCPC said the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector followed with 1,543 complaints, while fintech services ranked third with 1,442. It noted that electricity supply issues attracted 458 complaints, placing the sector fourth, with billing disputes and service failures dominating the cases.

The FCCPC also reported that e-commerce generated 412 complaints, telecommunications 409, retail and wholesale shopping 329, aviation 243, information technology 131, and road transport and logistics 114. The Commission stressed that, while e-commerce disputes are generally low in monetary value, their high frequency underscores the vulnerability of consumers in the retail space, particularly in cases of failed deliveries, refund challenges, and counterfeit goods.

The regulator stated that 9,091 consumer complaints were resolved between March and August, with more than N10 billion recovered for affected customers. It emphasised that the recovery reflected the scale of consumer harm and the financial burden Nigerians bear when businesses fail to provide adequate redress.

Reacting to the findings, the executive vice chairman and chief executive officer of the FCCPC, Tunji Bello, said the data reflected more than just statistics. He said, “These numbers are not just statistics; they tell the story of consumer frustration, and the daily challenges Nigerians face in essential services. However, the FCCPC is determined to hold businesses accountable, ensure compliance with the FCCPA, and promote fair market practices that protect the welfare of all consumers.”

The FCCPC added that banking and fintech dominated the volume of complaints and financial exposure, showing consumer vulnerability in essential and high-value services. The Commission said this trend signalled an urgent need for stronger collaboration with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to deepen oversight and strengthen consumer safeguards in financial services.

On electricity complaints, the Commission explained that persistent billing disputes and service delivery failures highlighted the need for greater coordination with the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), state electricity agencies, and distribution companies (DisCos).

The Commission further stated that the high incidence of disputes in digital lending, investment schemes, and microfinance coincided with the unveiling of its new regulatory framework to curb abuses in the fast-growing digital lending sector.

The FCCPC said it was intensifying monitoring, enforcement, and inter-agency collaboration, particularly in financial and utility services where consumer exploitation had become systemic. It stressed that regulated entities should carefully study the data trends and strengthen their internal mechanisms for complaint handling to ensure timely and equitable redress.

The Commission also urged consumers to continue reporting violations through its complaint portal, complaints.fccpc.gov.ng, and its zonal and state offices. It emphasised that every report submitted helps the agency identify systemic issues, enforce compliance, and protect consumer rights under the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Act (FCCPA) 2018.

"Central Bank, Securities Exchange Approve Wema Bank’s N150bn Rights Issue","The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have approved Wema Bank Plc’s N150 billion rights issue.

The bank concluded its Rights Issue on May 21st,2025, having opened the Issue on April 14th,2025.

This Rights Issue was undertaken in response to the CBN’s directive on the recapitalisation of banks in the country. With the successful completion and regulatory approval, Wema Bank has now met the N200 billion minimum capital requirement applicable to commercial banks with national authorisation.

In addition to the Rights Issue, Wema Bank also recently concluded a N50 billion Private Placement, which is now awaiting regulatory reviews, even as this additional capital raises the bank’s total capital base above the regulatory threshold, further strengthening its buffer, enhancing its shock-absorption capacity, and positioning the Bank for sustained growth.

Commenting on the bank’s success in meeting the regulatory threshold ahead of the 24-month timeline, Wema Bank’s MD/CEO, Moruf Oseni, reaffirmed its promise of delivering the best value as it continues its growth journey.

Oseni said, “As a growth-driven bank, the industry recapitalisation requirement came as a welcome mission, and we undertook it with complete confidence. Our success in surpassing the N200 billion benchmark ahead of the 2026 deadline not only reinforces our strong financial standing as a bank but also attests to the mutual trust and confidence that exists between

“Wema Bank and its shareholders. We do not take this trust for granted, and we take this moment to firmly reiterate our commitment to continue delivering optimum value to every shareholder and stakeholder of Wema Bank.”

He stressed that the conclusion of these capital-raising initiatives reinforces the bank’s prudential position and provides a solid foundation for long-term stability.

Speaking to newsmen in Lagos on Thursday, during the handing-over ceremony to Compt. Chidi Nwokorie assured officers that he would adopt an open-door policy and inclusive leadership style.

Speaking earlier, following his retirement after 35 years of meritorious service, Compt. Harrison expressed gratitude to the command’s officers and men for their dedication and professionalism during his tenure.

“I want to express my appreciation to all of you from different units and the services we have rendered to the government and ourselves as members of the Nigeria Customs Service. In our time, we had no incident or trouble that warranted somebody being dismissed or interdicted. We leveraged on intelligence and worked in the best possible way, day and night”, he said.

The outgoing controller described the new CAC’s posting as a welcome development, praising his background and experience as assets to the command.

“When I heard that the new controller is coming from Kebbi, I felt highly elated, that at least we have somebody who will have the national security consciousness at the back of his mind. I am confident that, from your experiences in other sectors and the service you have rendered to your country, you will be able to take us to the next level”, he noted.

He urged officers to extend their loyalty and support to the new controller to sustain the progress achieved at the command.

In his response, Comptroller Nwokorie thanked the Comptroller-General of Customs (CGC), Adewale Adeniyi, for entrusting him with the responsibility of leading the MMIA Command.

“I want to thank the Almighty God for a special day like this. I also thank the CGC, Adewale Adeniyi, for finding me worthy to come and represent him here. While sitting here, there’s no way I’ll know everything that’s happening. You, the officers on the field, are my eyes.

Nigeria Holds High-level Oil & Gas Devt Talks With Egypt,"The Federal Government of Nigeria and Egypt are exploring oil and gas development initiatives that will offer both countries opportunities to build strong partnership for economic prosperity.

Egypt’s minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Karim Badawi, held bilateral talks with Nigeria’s minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Ekperikpe Ekpo, on the sidelines of the Gastech 2025 conference in Milan, Italy. The meeting focused on enhancing cooperation and fostering joint investments in the oil and gas sectors.

The discussions covered a wide range of opportunities, including the exchange of technical expertise, joint investment in exploration and production, collaboration on liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects and infrastructure, and coordinated efforts within pan-African energy initiatives, according to Daily News Egypt reports.

The two ministers also explored ways to expand the presence of Egyptian petroleum companies in Nigeria, particularly in infrastructure development and project implementation.

Minister Badawi emphasised the strong ties between Egypt and Nigeria, reaffirming Egypt’s commitment to deepening cooperation with fellow African nations.

He noted that enhancing joint efforts in exploration, production, and infrastructure development serves the mutual interests of both countries and contributes to regional energy integration.

Minister Ekpo, in turn, praised Egypt’s achievements in energy infrastructure, expressing Nigeria’s interest in leveraging Egyptian expertise. He also highlighted the potential for joint investments and capacity-building programs, particularly in training and human resource development.

The talks concluded with both sides agreeing to continue consultations and coordination, with the aim of opening new avenues for cooperation and reinforcing Africa’s role as a key player in the global energy landscape.

As two of Africa’s largest oil and gas producers, Egypt and Nigeria are strategically positioned to lead regional collaboration. Egypt’s track record in developing pipelines, LNG facilities, and export terminals offers a valuable model for future cooperation.

Reps Panel ‘Orders’ Edun To Withdraw 2025 Budget Document,"The House of Representatives Committee on Appropriation has issued an ultimatum to the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, to withdraw the operational process for implementing the 2025 national budget.

Advertisement

In an exclusive letter sighted by LEADERSHIP, the Committee directed that the document titled “Operational Process for the Implementation of Year 2025 Budget” be withdrawn not later than Friday, September 12, 2025.

The lawmakers also asked the minister to formally notify all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of the decision.

The letter, signed by the Committee Chairman, Abubakar Kabir Abubakar, was titled “Transmission of Resolution on Withdrawal of Operations Process for Year 2025 Budget.” It followed a rowdy joint session held on Wednesday between the Committee, Edun, the Minister of Budget and Economic Planning, the Director-General of the Budget Office, and the Accountant-General of the Federation.

“At the session, the Committee unanimously resolved — with your concurrence — that the document titled ‘Operational Process for the Implementation of Year 2025 Budget’ (pages 7, 8 attached) should be formally withdrawn not later than Friday, 12th September 2025, with due notification to all MDAs,” the letter stated.

The lawmakers insisted on removing the two pages from the budget document, arguing that the process outlined was inconsistent with the established appropriation framework. They further directed the minister to acknowledge receipt of the resolution and confirm compliance.

When LEADERSHIP contacted both the director of information at the Federal Ministry of Finance, Mohammed Manga, and the special adviser to the Minister on media, Dr. Ogho Okiti, for the minister’s reaction, they could not react to the issue. While Manga said the document had been sent to the right person for reaction, Okiti said he would get back to us. None of them could return with a response by the time this report was filed last night.

The development comes against the federal government’s ongoing nationwide sensitisation for the 2025 budget. The finance and budget ministries have spearheaded the sensitisation exercise to create stakeholders’ awareness of the government’s fiscal priorities.

Wednesday’s heated engagement between Minister Edun and members of the House Appropriation Committee had highlighted deepening tensions over budgetary control and implementation guidelines.

NAFDAC Intercepts Fake Malaria Drugs Worth N1.2bn In Lagos,"As part of the efforts to combat the influx of fake, adulterated and expired drugs in the country, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has seized phoney malaria drugs worth N1.2 billion.

Advertisement

Speaking to journalists, the director of Investigation and Enforcement, Martin Dotun, lamented that despite efforts by the agency to rid the country of fake drugs, unscrupulous traders still import counterfeit drugs into the country for the consumption of unsuspecting members of the public.

According to Dotun, the imported fake and expired drugs were concealed inside vehicle spare parts and were seized in Lagos.

“As part of their efforts to deceive our personnel, the importer told NAFDAC officials who confronted them along Oshodi-Mile 2 Expressway that the vehicle contained spare parts, but when enforcement officials trailed the vehicle to its destination, it was discovered that the drugs were hidden among the supposed vehicle spare parts.

These are part of the follow-up series of operations, which we started a few months ago with the raid of Aba, Onitsha and Idumota markets, where we seized many drugs. And I can assure you that this will not stop until the mandate from President Tinubu and NAFDAC DG, Dr Mojisola Adeyeye, to save Nigerians from the menace of fake drugs is accomplished.

“You can imagine how many people these would have impacted if these were not quickly seized, especially as they came with different fake tags bearing different labels, as the label would have misled people into buying them as anti-malaria drugs.”

“We shall not leave any stone unturned until we stamp out such,” he noted.

Speaking earlier, the officer who led the operation on August 29, 2025, Florence Uba, said the seized drugs were labelled with different names.

“We saw the long truck loaded with supposed vehicle spare parts. But I decided to follow the vehicle to the warehouse where they were offloading the supposed vehicle spare parts. Though they tried to deceive us, telling us that it was merely spare parts, we, however, saw that these 277 cartons of the drugs were inside them.

“On closer look, we saw they gave fake declaration while the cartons carried different names, the packs of 277 carried different names, the sachets of the drugs carried two different names, and until we do Laboratory test, we are yet to know the exact contents of those sachets.

“We have here what they tagged Diclofenac potassium enteric coated 50mg, Arthemeter/ lemufathrine 80/480 Mg-, Each tablet supposedly contains Arthemeter/ lemufathrine 80/480 Mg until it is tested in the laboratory.”",https://leadership.ng/nafdac-intercepts-fake-malaria-drugs-worth-n1-2bn-in-lagos/,https://leadership.ng
"BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL, HAS BEEN AND WILL ALWAYS BE","“I am dripping melanin and honey. I am black without apology.”

I was in the kitchen trying to get lunch ready. My rug rat was not going to be very happy with what was on the menu but that was her business. Growing up, I did not have much of a choice as to what I wanted to eat at lunchtime with Mummy dearest and I am sure a lot of us can relate to those glorious days gone by. For those of us who grew up with not much wriggle room

around our parents, we had a lunch timetable, and it largely looked the same across households: breakfast would be bread, tea/hot chocolate – as it is now distinguished. Then, it was just Bournvita/Milo and eggs or cornflakes – Nasco to be precise. For lunch, it was definitely Tuwo da miya (solid gruel and soup) of some sort. My trip down memory lane does not end here. This was where the conditioning of saving my meat for last became ingrained to date!

Meat was the reward for a clean plate. We would have to go and present the dish to Mum to prove we had eaten all the food so we could collect our reward. By evening, things could get a little better; maybe some yam or chips, or if we were lucky, taliya (spaghetti).

Back to my kitchen. My rug rat ran in; she was about seven at the time, and this conversation ensued.

Rug rat: “Mummy, please, next time you go to the market, please buy (brand name) so that my skin will become lighter.”

Me: Stunned silence (where the heck did this come from??) I was upset.

My rug rat continued to talk without taking into consideration that I was quiet, which was a feat.

“Please, Mummy. So and so said their mother buys it for them, and that’s why they don’t come out to play. She doesn’t want their skin to become black.”

Now I was sad. I was also livid. At 7 years old, why were children already fixated on the colour of their skin? Why are we already brainwashing our children that light skin is better than dark skin? Maybe because I am dark-skinned and never really thought anything about it. Maybe because looks were never front and centre when I was growing up. I cannot remember any reference to looks by my parents. What I distinctly remember rather was the continuous reference to excellence in school and self-confidence. I was totally shocked to see how easy it would be to give my dark-skinned daughter a complex. The world she was growing in had become vainer and shallower. It has prioritised looks over everything else.

It was my duty to wake up to the reality and do something about

it. I had never had to have this kind of conversation with her. I mean, she was just seven; why would I think that skin colour was what she and her peers would be discussing??

Now, anyone who knows me knows that I will tell it as it is. For instance, I wouldn’t tell my daughter she’s a stunner if she isn’t; I would look for something else to positively reinforce her.

Yes, I hear you about telling our daughters that they are beautiful inside and out. Great, but I think balance is important and highlighting their best features is better. Anyway, looking back now, and based on the task ahead of me, it was in the plan and purpose that my daughter would be Alek Wek dark-skinned.

I stopped cooking. It looked like I would be open to making a lunchtime concession after the engagement that was coming up.

Me: (African mother mode) “What nonsense? Is that what you girls are talking about now? Which cream is better than the Shea butter you are using? I will soon stop you from going over to their place.”

So, you know this was high-pitched with anger, and she had a bewildered look. Now I had to remember that I wanted my parenting to be different in some ways to keep her close and talking to me (not the sparing the rod part!!!) and so I calmed down. This was going to be a teaching moment, It had to be even for me. I approached my conversation in four steps. 1. I hugged her. This was to give her a sense of safety, warmth and security. I thanked her for telling me. These children can be sneaky, and she could decide to go and start sharing their body cream under the guise of playing! Re-enforcing that Mummy should be who she should run to no matter what the situation, who she should talk to, and who she should tell anything. This is crucial with your child. You must cultivate an atmosphere where they can come and tell you anything. How else will you know? I am still very much an African Nigerian mother with a dash of Gen-Z/Alpha understanding.

2. Affirmation. “Do you realise you are a black beauty?” She looked totally unconvinced. I had never said it to her, and so this was a first, and coupled with the fact I was adding the villain colour to the praise.

3. Telling tangible facts. “Do you realise you cannot buy your skin colour in the market? On the catwalks of the world, your skin colour is premium; nothing exciting about light skin when they have white skin.

And, most importantly, as you grow older and age, black doesn’t crack; our dark skin takes a beating far better. Changing your skin colour will open you up to burns, discolourations, uneven skin tone, expensive maintenance and possibly skin cancer, not to mention self-esteem issues.

4. Teaching gratitude. It could have been worse. (I’m not elaborating!)

I must have done a good job because I never heard about it again. Instead, I regularly affirmed her on the skin colour. Right before my eyes, she blossomed into a beautiful girl for real. One day, she came back home and told me how her schoolmates would tell her that her skin was beautiful, and then the vanity started. She knows more about skincare than I do and won’t even allow me to kiss her on the forehead or cheeks!

She has totally embraced her skin colour, and in no small part, this is due to total strangers walking up to her and telling her how beautiful her skin colour is. Her confidence grew, but it had to start from home. I am grateful to the girl who asked her to buy the cream; I would not have become as intentional as I did with her and put her on a path of confidence-building.

This is for all the melanin queens out there: Black Is, Will, Has Always And Will Always Be Beautiful. It is the eternal beauty of black that has made it a target. It doesn’t help that everything bad is given a black connotation. But on the flip side, black is everybody’s favourite colour until it comes to skin colour – what irony. However, keep your head up; thankfully, there has been re-enforcement about the beauty of black in recent times, including the “Brown-skin Girls” song as an anthem of confidence.

There is a reason we all have different skin colours, and being dark-skinned is no different.

Light skin will always be considered attractive because it is what you see straight away, like shiny objects. Your colour, however, is more enduring because it is slow-burning and captivates longer.

Be the reason a dark-skinned girl consciously decides to keep her skin colour and not buy one from a poisonous bottle.

Final tips for maintaining your skin colour:

1. Drink lots and lots of water, keep it hydrated

2. Cut out refined sugar

3. Say No to fizzy drinks

4. Activate a simple skincare routine: cleanse, wash, moisturise. Let the skin breathe!

5. Drink your vitamins – carrot, orange, watermelon and cucumber. Thank me now. You are welcome.
